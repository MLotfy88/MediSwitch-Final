Other systemic glucocorticoid effects may include adrenal suppression, immunosuppression, posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma, bone loss, and growth retardation in children and adolescents. Following extensive use with a potent CYP450 3A4 inhibitor, a progressive dosage reduction may be required over a longer period if the corticosteroid is to be withdrawn from therapy, as there may be a significant risk of adrenal suppression.",
