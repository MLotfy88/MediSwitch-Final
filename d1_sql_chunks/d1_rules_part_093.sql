The proposed mechanism is enzalutamide-mediated induction of CYP450 3A4, the main isoenzyme responsible for the metabolism of apixaban. Enzalutamide is also considered a moderate CYP450 2C9 and 2C19 inducer in vivo; however, since metabolism of apixaban via these pathways is relatively minor, the significance remains unclear. In addition, there is conflicting evidence regarding the clinical effect of enzalutamide and its active metabolite N-desmethyl enzalutamide on the efflux transporter, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), of which apixaban is also a substrate.', 'DDInter', 1767317475, 'Due to the potential for enzalutamide to alter the efficacy of apixaban, concomitant use should be avoided if possible.
