For emergency contraception in patients who have used an hepatic enzyme inducer in the past 4 weeks, a non-hormonal emergency contraceptive (e.g., copper intrauterine device) is considered preferable.

Although breakthrough bleeding is not necessarily indicative of low ethinyl estradiol serum levels or increased risk of ovulation, some clinicians suggest that women who experience breakthrough bleeding during enzyme-inducing therapy may be prescribed an increased dose of ethinyl estradiol above 50 mcg daily by combining more than one formulation of contraceptive pill if necessary.  For levonorgestrel emergency contraception in patients receiving enzyme-inducing therapy, a regimen consisting of a 1.5 mg dose as soon as possible (within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse) followed by a 0.75 mg or 1.5 mg dose twelve hours later has been recommended by some clinicians.  An alternative is a single 2.25 mg dose as soon as possible following unprotected intercourse.  However, there are no data on efficacy, compliance, or side effects with any of these regimens.
