    "clinical_significance": "With the increase in research regarding alternative medical therapies, more and more physicians are embracing an integrative medical approach. Utilizing the benefits of both Eastern and Western practices for particular ailments works best. For example, alternative approaches lend themselves to treating vague symptoms, which Western medicine lacks definitive treatment options, such as fatigue, cold or flu symptoms, generalized gastrointestinal issues, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\n[13]\n\nOther ailments necessitate the involvement of antibiotics and/or surgery, such as appendicitis and certain bacterial infections. Some patients will seek out alternative medicine techniques initially, particularly if they are unlikely to cause harm or are less invasive, and reserve more allopathic remedies for instances in which alternative medicine has not been successful or situations that are more urgent. Alternative medicine has been shown to be helpful in augmenting treatment for mood disorders or behavior challenges in patients with dementia.\n[14]\n[15]\n\nRemaining open-minded and tailoring treatment therapies to individual patients, their interests, and belief systems proves the most beneficial healing method. Finally, staying up to date on research supporting or refuting all types of medical treatment is vital to providing effective and appropriate care for your patients."
