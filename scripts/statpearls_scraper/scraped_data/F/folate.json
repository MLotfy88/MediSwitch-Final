    "indications": "White-centered retinal hemorrhages, also known as Roth spots, were first described by Moritz Roth, a Swiss physician, in 1872. The eponym was introduced in 1878 by Moritz Litten, who reported that white-centered retinal hemorrhages were present in approximately 80% of cases of subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE). Roth spots are most frequently associated with infective endocarditis but may also occur in hematologic, vascular, metabolic, and obstetric conditions such as leukemia, anemia, hypertensive retinopathy, preeclampsia, diabetic retinopathy, and anoxia.\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n\nRoth spots comprise distinctive retinal lesions characterized by pale or white centers within areas of hemorrhage. These lesions are often identified incidentally during fundus examination. Historically considered pathognomonic for SBE, Roth spots are now recognized as nonspecific indicators of systemic vascular injury. The classical retinal finding consists of a retinal hemorrhage secondary to ruptured capillaries, with the central pale region containing fibrin-platelet aggregates, ischemic necrosis, or leukocyte collections. These lesions usually localize in the posterior pole near the vascular arcades and may appear round or flame-shaped, depending on the retinal layer affected. Recognition of Roth spots is clinically significant, as their presence may serve as an early ophthalmic marker of underlying systemic disease.\n[4]\n\nThe historical origins of Roth spots date to the 19th century, when Moritz Roth first described these lesions in association with septicemia. Subsequent refinements by Moritz Litten and later investigators clarified their histopathologic composition, disproving the early assumption that the white center represented bacterial microabscesses. Modern histologic and clinical evidence demonstrates that the pale center consists primarily of fibrin and platelet aggregates, occasionally interspersed with inflammatory cells, reflecting localized capillary rupture and thrombosis. This reinterpretation expanded the clinical relevance of Roth spots beyond endocarditis, establishing them as retinal manifestations of microvascular injury arising from diverse systemic disorders.\n[5]\n\nRoth spots develop when retinal capillaries sustain endothelial disruption, resulting in extravasation of red blood cells into surrounding retinal tissue. Platelet activation and fibrin deposition at the site of vascular injury generate the characteristic white center. Multiple mechanisms may precipitate this process, including septic embolization, immune complex deposition, hypoxia, and increased vascular fragility.\n\nIn infective endocarditis, circulating immune complexes and septic emboli lodge within retinal arterioles, initiating localized vasculitis and hemorrhage. In hematologic disorders such as leukemia and anemia, reduced oxygen delivery and altered blood viscosity impair vascular integrity. Metabolic and vascular diseases, including diabetes mellitus and hypertension, promote chronic microangiopathy. Collectively, these mechanisms illustrate that Roth spots represent a final common pathway of retinal microvascular injury resulting from systemic disease.\n[6]\n\nClinically, Roth spots appear as round or oval retinal hemorrhages with a central pale area, typically located along the posterior pole or near the major vascular arcades. On ophthalmoscopy, superficial lesions often assume a flame-shaped configuration, whereas deeper hemorrhages appear round. Advances in multimodal retinal imaging, including spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), have enhanced the understanding of their morphology. OCT reveals hyperreflective foci within the inner retinal layers corresponding to fibrin deposits, while FFA demonstrates hypofluorescence caused by blocked fluorescence and, in some cases, adjacent capillary nonperfusion.\n[7]\n\nThe spectrum of systemic diseases associated with Roth spots is broad. SBE is the classic cause, where these lesions signify systemic embolization and immune-mediated vasculitis. Hematologic disorders such as leukemia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia feature Roth spots secondary to vascular fragility and coagulopathic abnormalities. In chronic metabolic and vascular diseases, including diabetes mellitus and hypertension, Roth spots may coexist with other microvascular changes such as cotton-wool spots and microaneurysms, both markers of focal retinal ischemia.\n\nAutoimmune diseases, notably systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APLS), produce similar findings through immune-complex vasculopathy. Less commonly, Roth spots are associated with HIV retinopathy, meningococcal infection, septicemia, trauma, and Valsalva maneuvers.\n[8]\n\nFrom a diagnostic perspective, the identification of Roth spots necessitates a comprehensive systemic evaluation rather than isolated ophthalmic management (see\nImage\n. Management Pathway for Roth Spots). Baseline investigations should include a complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and blood cultures when infection is suspected. Echocardiography is warranted if SBE is a consideration, particularly in the presence of systemic manifestations such as fever, cardiac murmurs, or embolic events.\n\nHematologic assessment, including peripheral smear and bone marrow examination, may reveal anemia, leukemia, or thrombocytopenia. In metabolic or autoimmune disorders, evaluation should include fasting glucose, renal function tests, and serologic markers such as antinuclear antibody, anti-double-stranded DNA, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), and antiphospholipid antibodies. Therefore, the presence of Roth spots functions as a clinical biomarker prompting coordinated evaluation among ophthalmologists, internists, and cardiologists.\n[9]\n\nRoth spots are typically asymptomatic and seldom impair vision, yet their systemic significance is considerable. In SBE, the occurrence of these ocular lesions reflects embolic dissemination and correlates with disease severity. In hematologic disorders, the presence of Roth spots may parallel disease activity or recurrence, rendering serial fundus examinations a useful adjunct for systemic monitoring. The lesions generally resolve following treatment of the underlying condition, although recurrence may signify persistent vascular injury or inadequate systemic control.\n[10]\n\nAdvances in retinal imaging technology have substantially improved the detection and interpretation of Roth spots. OCT and OCT angiography (OCTA) have delineated their structural and vascular features, revealing inner retinal hyperreflectivity and localized perfusion deficits. Adaptive optics and confocal imaging further enhance cellular-level visualization, allowing detailed characterization of the lesions. Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled automated detection of Roth spots and other hemorrhagic retinal signs, supporting integration of ocular imaging into systemic health assessment through teleophthalmology.\n\nAlthough historically linked to diseases such as endocarditis, Roth spots remain clinically relevant in modern medicine. These lesions exemplify the interconnection between systemic vascular integrity and retinal microcirculation. The recognition of these retinal abnormalities should prompt consideration of systemic pathology, as they may indicate underlying processes with life-threatening potential. Awareness of the nonspecific nature of Roth spots prevents diagnostic overinterpretation while emphasizing their function as sentinel indicators of microvascular injury.\n\nRoth spots represent a distinctive interface between ophthalmology and systemic medicine. The presence of these retinal hemorrhages reflects microvascular compromise due to infection, hematologic imbalance, autoimmune inflammation, or metabolic stress. Advances in imaging and the renewed focus on systemic retinal markers have reinforced their diagnostic value. While not pathognomonic for any single condition, Roth spots are critical clinical indicators guiding comprehensive systemic evaluation. For the modern clinician, identifying a Roth spot extends beyond ophthalmic observation, as it signifies the need to explore deeper systemic disease, underscoring the principle that the eye mirrors overall health.\n[11]",
    "mechanism": "Historically, Roth spots were regarded as pathognomonic for SBE, attributed to septic emboli within the retina. However, recent histopathologic evidence indicates that these lesions result from retinal capillary rupture and intraretinal hemorrhage. Roth spots occur across various systemic diseases involving retinal vascular injury and hemorrhage. A unifying feature among these conditions is endothelial dysfunction predisposing to capillary disruption. Microscopic examination demonstrates that the pale centers of these lesions consist primarily of fibrin, representing a fibrin-platelet plug at the site of vascular rupture.\n[12]\n\nRoth spots are multifactorial, reflecting a final common pathway of vascular and hematologic disturbances rather than a discrete disease entity (see\nImage\n. Etiology of Roth Spots). These ocular abnormalities represent retinal hemorrhages with a central white or pale focus arising from microvascular injury, endothelial damage, and impaired hemostasis within the retinal circulation. The pale center typically corresponds to fibrin-platelet aggregates, inflammatory infiltrates, or foci of ischemic necrosis surrounded by extravasated erythrocytes. These lesions are nonspecific and occur secondary to diverse systemic processes that induce vascular fragility, immune complex deposition, or hematologic dysregulation.\n[13]\n\nHistorically, Roth spots were first described in association with infective endocarditis, in which immune complex-mediated vasculitis and septic emboli induce localized vascular occlusion and leakage. In bacterial endocarditis, deposition of circulating immune complexes within retinal capillaries initiates complement activation, endothelial injury, and subsequent hemorrhage. The central white spot, previously attributed to leukocytic infiltration, is now recognized to consist primarily of fibrin and platelet aggregates formed at the site of vascular disruption. Beyond endocarditis, septicemia, particularly from streptococcal or staphylococcal infection, can similarly produce immune-mediated retinal microinfarctions, underscoring the immunopathologic and embolic mechanisms involved in Roth spot formation.\n[14]\n\nHematologic disorders comprise another major etiologic group. In anemia and thrombocytopenia, reduced oxygen delivery and defective hemostasis contribute to capillary hypoxia, fragility, and intraretinal hemorrhage. Conversely, in leukemia, particularly acute forms, Roth spots arise through leukostasis, anemia, and endothelial infiltration by malignant cells. Leukemic retinopathy reflects the combined effects of hyperviscosity, tissue hypoxia, and microvascular occlusion. Likewise, aplastic and megaloblastic anemias compromise marrow function and impair vascular repair, further predisposing to retinal hemorrhagic manifestations.\n[15]\n\nVasculitic and immune-mediated disorders play a significant role in the development of Roth spots. Conditions such as SLE, Behçet disease, and APLS induce immune complex-mediated endothelial injury, whereas hypertension and diabetes mellitus cause direct microangiopathic damage. In diabetic retinopathy, capillary basement membrane thickening and pericyte loss weaken the vascular wall, predisposing to hemorrhage. In hypertensive crises, abrupt arteriolar constriction and rupture may produce Roth-like hemorrhagic lesions. Autoimmune vasculitides, including granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), can cause focal capillary necrosis with hemorrhagic exudation and fibrin deposition, resulting in retinal findings that mimic Roth spots (see\nImage\n. Systemic Pathways Leading to Roth Spots).\n[16]\n\nSystemic embolic phenomena constitute another important etiologic group. In SBE, septic emboli originating from valvular vegetations occlude retinal arterioles, leading to focal infarction and hemorrhage. Noninfectious embolic states, such as marantic endocarditis, atrial myxoma, or prosthetic valve thrombosis, produce comparable retinal changes through sterile microemboli. The ensuing microinfarction promotes local necrosis and fibrin-platelet aggregation, generating the characteristic pale center. These manifestations underscore the value of Roth spots as ophthalmic indicators of systemic embolic disease.\n[17]\n\nMetabolic and nutritional disorders also contribute to the development of Roth spots. Diabetes mellitus, uremia, and hyperlipidemia induce endothelial dysfunction and increase vascular permeability. Chronic kidney disease (CKD), through the accumulation of uremic toxins, impairs platelet function and weakens capillary integrity, predisposing to retinal hemorrhages with central pale foci. Similarly, deficiencies of vitamin B12 and folate produce megaloblastic changes in the bone marrow and ineffective erythropoiesis, which compromise vascular stability. Vitamin C deficiency (scurvy) results in defective collagen synthesis, diminishing vascular wall strength and rendering capillaries susceptible to rupture under minimal hemodynamic stress.\n[18]\n\nAdditional precipitating factors include trauma, hypoxia, and systemic stress states. Retinal venous congestion from elevated intracranial pressure or the Valsalva maneuver may cause rupture of fragile retinal vessels. In neonates, birth trauma and perinatal hypoxia have been reported as rare causes of Roth-like retinal hemorrhages. Similarly, exposure to high altitude can induce hypoxia-mediated endothelial dysfunction, leading to microvascular rupture and focal fibrin deposition.\n[19]\n\nRecent histopathologic investigations have refined the understanding of Roth spot composition. The central pale region, historically attributed to leukocytic infiltration, is now identified as a platelet-fibrin thrombus encircled by extravasated erythrocytes and necrotic cellular debris. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrates the presence of fibrin and platelet markers, confirming a thrombohemorrhagic rather than purely inflammatory origin. In infective etiologies such as endocarditis, inflammatory infiltrates and bacterial antigens may also be detected, indicating overlapping mechanisms involving thrombosis, immune-mediated endothelial injury, and microbial invasion.\n[20]\n\nRoth spots may also occur in iatrogenic and drug-related contexts. Chemotherapeutic agents, anticoagulants, and immunosuppressive drugs can induce hematologic suppression or coagulopathy, predisposing to retinal microhemorrhage. Methotrexate and cytarabine commonly give rise to pancytopenia, whereas warfarin and heparin therapy may accentuate bleeding risk. In bone marrow transplant recipients, graft-versus-host disease and profound thrombocytopenia further increase susceptibility to retinal vascular injury.\n\nIn contemporary clinical practice, Roth spots are recognized not as pathognomonic for a specific disease but as nonspecific retinal biomarkers of systemic microvascular injury. These microvascular markers indicate underlying systemic pathology—infectious, hematologic, embolic, or immune-mediated—that necessitates comprehensive evaluation. Detection during fundus examination should prompt systemic assessment for SBE, anemia, leukemia, vasculitis, or coagulopathies, particularly when accompanied by constitutional symptoms such as fever, pallor, or petechiae.\n\nThe etiology of Roth spots reflects the convergence of vascular injury, endothelial dysfunction, and coagulative imbalance. Each lesion represents localized capillary rupture with subsequent fibrin deposition at the site of endothelial compromise. Although historically associated with infective endocarditis, current understanding establishes Roth spots as the final common expression of diverse systemic disorders that impair microvascular integrity. Identification of these lesions serves as a critical diagnostic cue, guiding timely systemic evaluation and management of potentially life-threatening underlying disease.\n[21]",
    "monitoring": "Roth spots suggest systemic pathology. Therefore, every patient should undergo detailed clinical, laboratory, and imaging investigations to determine the root cause.\n\nInitial evaluation begins with a thorough history and physical examination, guiding targeted laboratory and imaging studies. A CBC with differential count is essential to detect anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, or blast cells suggestive of leukemia. If leukemia or aplastic anemia is suspected, further evaluation should include a peripheral smear, bone marrow aspiration or biopsy, flow cytometry for immunophenotyping of malignant cells, and cytogenetic analysis to detect chromosomal abnormalities. These investigations help confirm the diagnosis and guide subsequent management.\n\nInflammatory and infectious processes may be assessed with erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and blood cultures, particularly in febrile patients or suspected bacterial endocarditis cases. An autoimmune panel, including antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, and ANCA, may be performed to evaluate for underlying vasculitides. Coagulation studies (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, D-dimer, and international normalized ratio) evaluate for coagulopathy or DIC. Viral serology, including HIV and hepatitis B and C testing, may be indicated in immunocompromised individuals.\n[49]\n\nScreening for diabetes mellitus should include fasting plasma glucose or hemoglobin A1c, while renal and liver function tests provide insight into systemic metabolic status.\n[50]\nA lipid profile may be indicated to identify dyslipidemic conditions that contribute to retinal microvascular compromise.\n\nOCT can delineate the retinal hemorrhage layers, revealing hyperreflective intraretinal deposits surrounded by hyporeflective hemorrhagic zones. FFA may show blocked fluorescence corresponding to the hemorrhage, while OCTA allows assessment of microvascular ischemia. Incidentally discovered Roth spots should prompt referral to internal medicine or hematology for systemic evaluation.\n[51]\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography may be indicated if neurologic symptoms such as headache, confusion, or seizures suggest central nervous system vasculitis or microembolic phenomena. Carotid Doppler ultrasonography may be performed when embolic disease is suspected. Echocardiography, either transthoracic or transesophageal, remains essential for detecting vegetations or valvular abnormalities in cases of infective endocarditis.\n\nAn electrocardiogram should be performed to detect cardiac rhythm abnormalities resulting from endocardial involvement. Roth spots may also be observed in conditions such as preeclampsia, high-altitude retinopathy, or shock, underscoring the importance of clinical correlation.\n[52]",
    "administration": "Most white-centered retinal hemorrhages resolve spontaneously without direct intervention. Management focuses on identifying and treating the underlying systemic disorder, as addressing the primary etiology prevents potential ocular and systemic complications. Follow-up with an ophthalmologist is recommended, particularly in patients in whom Roth spots are identified during acute illness.\n[53]\n\nRoth spots represent nonspecific retinal findings arising from capillary rupture and intraretinal hemorrhage with fibrin-platelet deposition. These lesions generally resolve once the primary disease is controlled. Therefore, the ophthalmologist’s role is crucial in recognizing these lesions as indicators of systemic pathology and facilitating appropriate interprofessional evaluation and management.\n\nEtiology-Based Management\n\nRoth spots do not comprise a primary disease but rather a manifestation of microvascular injury secondary to systemic pathology. These lesions typically regress within weeks with appropriate therapy, leaving no permanent retinal damage.\n\nIn patients with infective endocarditis, management involves prolonged intravenous antibiotic therapy tailored to blood culture sensitivities. Surgical intervention, including valve repair or replacement, may be required in cases of valvular destruction, abscess formation, or refractory infection. Retinal lesions usually resolve following control of the systemic infection.\n[54]\nFor hematologic malignancies such as leukemia, treatment targets the primary disorder through chemotherapy, bone marrow transplantation, or targeted agents. Supportive transfusions may be necessary for anemia or thrombocytopenia, and corticosteroids or immunomodulators may be employed when vascular fragility contributes to hemorrhage.\n[55]\n\nIn nutritional anemias, particularly those due to vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, supplementation restores vascular integrity and promotes resolution of Roth spots. In cases of aplastic anemia or bone marrow failure, supportive interventions, including erythropoietin, transfusion, or immunosuppressive therapy, are indicated to address the underlying hematologic compromise.\n[56]\nIn patients with diabetes mellitus, strict glycemic control is essential to prevent recurrence or progression of microvascular retinal changes, with optimization of insulin or oral hypoglycemic therapy and concomitant management of blood pressure and lipids.\n[57]\n\nRoth spots arising from hypertensive emergencies require urgent blood pressure reduction using agents such as labetalol or nicardipine, with careful monitoring to avoid optic nerve ischemia.\n[58]\nIn cases related to trauma or Valsalva retinopathy, conservative management is preferred, as vision generally recovers spontaneously with hemorrhage resolution. For septicemia or sepsis-related microangiopathy, aggressive treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and source control is essential, with Roth spots improving gradually as systemic inflammation resolves.\n[59]\n\nEmerging Therapeutic Perspectives\n\nNovel strategies aimed at vascular stabilization are under investigation. Angiogenesis inhibitors and anti-inflammatory agents targeting microvascular permeability may provide adjunctive benefit in selected conditions, including diabetic and septic retinopathy. Additionally, machine learning-assisted analysis of fundus images has the potential to improve early detection of microvascular alterations, facilitating prompt systemic evaluation.\n[60]\n\nOphthalmic Follow-Up and Monitoring\n\nBaseline fundus photography should be performed to document the presence and distribution of Roth spots. Follow-up imaging at intervals of 2 to 4 weeks is recommended to assess lesion resolution. No local ocular therapy is indicated in the absence of progression. Intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy or focal laser treatment may be considered in rare cases of vision-threatening hemorrhage or macular involvement, although supporting evidence remains limited.\n[61]",
    "adverse_effects": "Roth spots rarely produce direct ocular complications and generally resolve without permanent retinal damage. Visual impairment is uncommon and typically transient, except in cases with macular involvement or extensive hemorrhage. Clinically significant complications are primarily related to the underlying systemic condition, such as embolic events in endocarditis, bleeding in cytopenic states, or vascular compromise in severe hypertension, rather than the retinal lesion itself."
