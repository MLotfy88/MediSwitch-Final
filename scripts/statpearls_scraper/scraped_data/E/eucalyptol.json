    "indications": "There are no described contraindications for olfactory training in terms of past medical or surgical history or medications. However, the value of olfactory training for treating olfactory dysfunction secondary to sinonasal disease remains yet to be determined.\n[8]\nMany patients with olfactory dysfunction due to sinonasal disease, especially those with chronic rhinosinusitis (with or without polyposis), may benefit from functional endoscopic surgery, generally with a pre-operative course of nasal topical steroids.\n[9]\nThus, medical and surgical options may be considered first to manage patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.\n[8]\nOlfactory training may be considered for olfactory dysfunction secondary to sinonasal disease when surgical treatment options are exhausted, not possible, or after completion of surgical interventions.\n[9]",
    "clinical_significance": "Except for post-viral olfactory dysfunction and olfactory dysfunction secondary to chronic rhinosinusitis, there is no established medical or surgical treatment for olfactory dysfunction.\n[8]\nThus, olfactory training is the only treatment option available to patients with olfactory dysfunction due to other etiologies. For this reason, olfactory training is particularly important for the management of patients with olfactory decline."
