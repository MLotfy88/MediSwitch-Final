    "indications": "Colchicine metabolism in the liver and other tissues depends on the P-glycoprotein transport and CYP 384 isoenzymes. This drug is eliminated unchanged in the urine and via metabolism. P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4 inhibitors can suppress the metabolism of colchicine and, therefore, increase plasma levels of colchicine. Impairment of renal and hepatic function can decrease the metabolism and clearance of colchicine and result in elevated concentrations. These elevated levels can cause adverse reactions, including death.\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n\nThe concomitant use of a P-glycoprotein or CYP3A4 inhibitor and colchicine in the presence of renal or hepatic impairment is contraindicated.\nDose adjustments or alternative therapies are considerations for patients with renal or hepatic impairment who are not taking a P-glycoprotein or CYP3A4 inhibitor.\n\nWarning and Precautions\n\nFatal overdoses have been reported in adults and children who have accidentally or intentionally ingested colchicine. This drug should be kept away from children's reach.\n\nBiliary obstruction, renal impairment, hepatic disease, and renal disease\n\nDosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with normal renal and hepatic function, those taking interacting medications, and patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Patients with renal impairment or elevated plasma concentrations of colchicine due to renal disease can develop myeloneuropathy characterized by proximal weakness, elevated serum creatinine, and possibly rhabdomyolysis. Colchicine is eliminated through biliary pathways. Therefore, clinicians considering colchicine for patients with hepatic disease or hepatic biliary obstruction should consider alternative therapies.\n\nAlcoholism and gastrointestinal disease\n\nThe risk for colchicine-induced gastrointestinal tissue damage may be elevated in patients with preexisting alcoholism or gastrointestinal disease. Clinicians should consider adjustments in dosing for these patients.\n\nBone marrow suppression\n\nProlonged colchicine therapy is associated with bone marrow suppression, so it should be used cautiously in patients with preexisting bone marrow suppression. Therapeutic doses of colchicine have reportedly been associated with myelosuppression, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, and aplastic anemia. Colchicine may also worsen these types of blood dyscrasias.\n\nDialysis\n\nDialysis does not effectively remove colchicine; patients undergoing dialysis require a dosage reduction secondary to their impaired renal function.\n\nDental disease\n\nColchicine can cause myelosuppression, so it should be prescribed cautiously to patients with dental disease. Any significant dental procedures should be performed before initiating colchicine therapy or delayed until the patient's blood count returns to normal.\n\nNeuromuscular toxicity\n\nColchicine-induced neuromuscular toxicity and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients receiving prolonged treatment. Patients with renal impairment and older patients, even those with normal renal and hepatic function, are at increased risk. Concomitant use of colchicine and atorvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, gemfibrozil, and fenofibric acid or cyclosporine may potentiate the development of myopathy.\n[12]",
    "mechanism": "Colchicine demonstrates primarily anti-inflammatory effects; it disrupts cytoskeletal functions by inhibiting β-tubulin polymerization into microtubules, preventing activation, degranulation, and migration of neutrophils associated with mediating some gout symptoms. Colchicine does not inhibit phagocytosis of uric acid crystals, but it does seem to prevent the release of an inflammatory glycoprotein from phagocytes. Colchicine blocks metaphase through 2 separate anti-mitotic effects: disruption of mitotic spindle formation and disruption of the sol-gel formation. The toxic effects of colchicine are related to this anti-mitotic activity within proliferating tissue such as skin, hair, and bone marrow.\n[5]\n[6]\n\nThe mechanism of action of colchicine as a treatment for familial Mediterranean fever is less well understood; it may interfere with the intracellular assembly of the inflammasome complex present in neutrophils and monocytes that mediate the activation or interleukin-1-β.\n\nPharmacokinetics\n\nAbsorption:\nColchicine is readily absorbed within 3 hours when given orally to healthy adults. After a single dose of 0.6 mg administered under fasting conditions, this medication reaches a plasma concentration of 1.1 to 4.4 ng/mL. Oral colchicine has an absolute bioavailability of approximately 45%, and taking the drug with food reduces absorption by approximately 15%. However, this decrease does not appear to cause clinically significant differences.\n\nDistribution:\nColchicine has low protein binding, and its volume of distribution in healthy young adults ranges from 5 to 8 L/kg. The drug crosses the placenta and enters breast milk.\n\nMetabolism:\nColchicine is metabolized via CYP3A4 and demethylated into 2-O-demethylcolchicine and 3-O-demethylcolchicine in the liver and other tissues.\n\nElimination:\nThe mean elimination half-life of colchicine in young, healthy adults is 26.6 to 31.2 hours. This drug is primarily eliminated unchanged in bile and urine.",
    "administration": "Available Forms and Strengths\n\nColchicine is available as a tablet, capsule, and solution. In tablet form, it is available in 0.6 and 0.5 mg formulations. Capsules are available in 0.6 mg. There is a topical gel homeopathic formulation of\nColchicum autumnale\n.\n\nColchicine is typically administered orally, and the use of the topical gel is rare. Due to toxicity, the injectable form is no longer available in the United States.\n\nAdult Dosage\n\nThe long-term administration of colchicine is currently being evaluated as prophylaxis of gout flares and FMF. However, the efficacy and safety of repeated treatment for gout flares have not been studied. The dosing regimens for colchicine are different for each indication and must be individualized.\n\nProphylaxis of gout flares:\nColchicine dosing is 0.6 mg once or twice a day in patients older than 16; the maximum dose is 1.2 mg daily. The initiation of uric acid-lowering therapies, such as allopurinol, pegloticase, and febuxostat, can lead to an increase in gout flares. This occurs because fluctuations in serum uric acid levels cause urate deposits in tissues to mobilize. To manage this, it is advisable to use colchicine as part of gout flare prophylaxis when starting these therapies. Prophylactic treatment is often recommended for a minimum of the first 6 months after beginning uric acid-lowering therapy.\n\nTreatment of acute gout flare:\nColchicine 1.2 mg is administered at the first sign of a gout flare, followed by 0.6 mg an hour later. The maximum allowed dose is 1.8 mg over 1 hour. If a patient uses colchicine for gout prophylaxis, this dose should not be administered until 12 hours later.\n\nFamilial Mediterranean fever:\n1.2 mg to 2.4 mg for patients older than 12. The daily dose is administered in 1 or 2 doses and may be increased by 0.3 mg per day to control disease or reduced by 0.3 mg per day if adverse effects are intolerable. The maximum daily dose is 2.4 mg.\n\nSpecific Patient Populations\n\nHepatic impairment:\nThe dose of colchicine might need to be adjusted depending on the degree of hepatic impairment, as discussed below.\n\nProphylaxis of gout flares\n\nPatients with mild to moderate hepatic function impairment are not required to adjust the dose but should be monitored closely for adverse effects.\nThe initial dose should be reduced for patients with severe impairment, and any patients undergoing dose increases should be closely monitored.\n\nTreatment of gout flares\n\nThe dose does not require adjustment for patients with mild to moderate hepatic function impairment, but the patient should be monitored closely for adverse effects.\nWhile the dose is the same for patients with severe impairment, a treatment course should not be repeated more than once every 2 weeks. If patients require repeated courses, consider alternate therapy.\nTreatment of gout flares with colchicine is not recommended for patients with hepatic impairment who are receiving colchicine for prophylaxis.\n\nFamilial Mediterranean fever\n\nPatients with mild to moderate hepatic function impairment are not required to adjust the dose but should be monitored closely for adverse effects.\nFor patients with severe impairment, the initial dose should be reduced, and any increase in dose should be accompanied by close monitoring.\n\nRenal impairment:\nThe dose might need to be adjusted depending on the degree of renal impairment, as discussed below.\n\nFor prophylaxis of gout flares\n\nPatients with mild (CrCl of 50 to 80 mL/min) to moderate (CrCl of 30 to 50 mL/min) renal function impairment are not required to adjust the dose but should be monitored closely for adverse effects.\nFor patients with severe impairment, the starting dose should be reduced to 0.3 mg daily, and any dose increases should be accompanied by close monitoring.\nFor patients undergoing dialysis, the starting dose should be 0.3 mg, given twice a week with close monitoring.\n\nTreatment of gout flares\n\nFor patients with mild to moderate renal function impairment, there is no need to adjust the dose, but the patient should be monitored closely for adverse effects of colchicine.\nFor patients with severe impairment, while the dose is the same, a treatment course should not be repeated more than once every 2 weeks. If patients require repeated courses, consider alternate therapy.\nFor patients undergoing dialysis, the total recommended dose should be decreased, only a single 0.6 mg dose should be administered, and a treatment course should not be repeated more than once every 2 weeks.\nTreatment of gout flares with colchicine is not recommended for patients with renal impairment who are already receiving this drug for prophylaxis.\n\nFamilial Mediterranean fever\n\nCaution is advised when administering colchicine to patients with moderate and severe renal impairment and those undergoing dialysis. The dosage should be reduced for these patients.\n\nPatients with mild to moderate renal impairment should be monitored closely for adverse effects, and a dose reduction may be necessary.\nPatients with severe renal impairment: initiate at 0.3 mg/day; if the dose must be increased, the patient should be monitored closely for adverse effects.\nThe recommended starting dose for patients undergoing dialysis is 0.3 mg daily. However, with adequate monitoring for colchicine's adverse effects, the dose may be increased.\n\nPregnancy considerations:\nColchicine is classified as a pregnancy category C drug. Colchicine therapy during pregnancy should only be initiated if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the possible risk to the fetus.\n\nBreastfeeding considerations:\nColchicine is excreted into human breast milk. Colchicine can alter gastrointestinal cell renewal and permeability; however, no adverse effects have been reported in breastfed infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics considers colchicine compatible with breastfeeding in most scenarios.\n\nPediatric patients:\n\nProphylaxis and treatment of gout flares: Colchicine is not recommended for prophylaxis or treatment of gout flares in pediatric patients.\n\nFamilial Mediterranean fever: The recommended colchicine dosage for FMF in pediatric patients 4 or older is based on the patient's age. The following daily doses can be administered either as a single dose or divided into 2 doses per day:\n\nChildren aged 4 to 6: 0.3 mg to 1.8 mg daily\nChildren aged 6 to 12: 0.9 mg to 1.8 mg daily\nAdolescents older than 12: 1.2 mg to 2.4 mg daily\n\nOlder patients:\nOlder adults have an increased risk of neuromuscular toxicity and rhabdomyolysis when taking colchicine, regardless of renal and hepatic impairment. Caution is necessary, and a dose adjustment may be appropriate when prescribing colchicine to these patients.",
    "adverse_effects": "The most common adverse reactions are related to the gastrointestinal tract. Diarrhea is the most commonly reported symptom (23%), followed by vomiting (17%) and nausea (4% to 17%). Central nervous system symptoms, such as fatigue and headache, and endocrine and metabolic conditions, such as gout and pharyngolaryngeal pain, have been reported.\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n\nWhile less common, the following adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving colchicine therapy and are thought to be reversible upon discontinuation of the medication or lowering the dose:\n\nNeurologic: sensorimotor neuropathy\n[10]\nDermatologic: alopecia, maculopapular rash, purpura, rash\n[11]\nGastrointestinal: abdominal cramping, abdominal pain, lactose intolerance\nHematologic: leukopenia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, aplastic anemia\nHepatobiliary: elevated AST, elevated ALT\nMusculoskeletal: myopathy, elevated CPK, myotonia, muscle weakness, muscle pain, rhabdomyolysis\n[12]\nReproductive: azoospermia, oligospermia\n[13]\n\nDrug-Drug Interactions\n\nColchicine is a substrate for the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein. Of the cytochrome P450 enzymes tested, CYP3A4 is the primary enzyme involved in the metabolism of colchicine. If administering colchicine with drugs that inhibit P-glycoprotein, most of which also inhibit CYP3A4, increased concentrations of colchicine are likely, and there are reports of fatal drug interactions. The colchicine dose should be adjusted when co-administered with drugs known to inhibit CYP3A4 or P-glycoprotein. These combinations should be avoided for patients with renal or hepatic impairment due to increased toxicity risk.\n[14]\n\nThe following medications should be used with caution when co-administered with colchicine:\n\nPotent CYP3A4 inhibitors:\n\nThese medications include atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and telithromycin, darunavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir. Avoid colchicine use with these drugs in patients with renal or hepatic impairment due to increased toxicity risk.\n\nProphylaxis of gout flares\n\nStandard dose: 0.6 mg once or twice daily\nAdjusted dose: Reduce to 0.3 mg once daily or every other day\n\nTreatment of gout flares\n\nStandard dose: 1.2 mg initially, followed by 0.6 mg an hour later (repeat no earlier than 3 days)\nAdjusted dose: Reduce to 0.6 mg initially, followed by 0.3 mg an hour later (repeat no earlier than 3 days)\n\nFamilial Mediterranean fever\n\nStandard dose: Maximum daily dose of 1.2 to 2.4 mg\nAdjusted dose: Maximum daily dose reduced to 0.6 mg (may be given as 0.3 mg twice daily)\n\nModerate CYP3A4 inhibitors:\n\nThe medications amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, grapefruit juice, and verapamil can increase colchicine plasma levels, with risks of neuromuscular toxicity (notably with diltiazem and verapamil).\n\nProphylaxis of gout flares\n\nStandard: 0.6 mg twice daily → Adjusted: 0.3 mg twice daily or 0.6 mg once daily\nStandard: 0.6 mg once daily → Adjusted: 0.3 mg once daily\n\nTreatment of gout flares\n\nStandard: 1.2 mg, followed by 0.6 mg an hour later →  Adjusted: Same initial dose but repeat dosing no earlier than 3 days\n\nFamilial Mediterranean fever\n\nStandard: Maximum daily dose of 1.2 to 2.4 mg → Adjusted: Reduce the maximum daily dose to 1.2 mg (eg, 0.6 mg twice daily)\n\nP-glycoprotein inhibitors:\n\nThis group includes the medications cyclosporine and ranolazine.\n\nProphylaxis of gout flares\n\nStandard dose: 0.6 mg twice daily\nAdjusted dose: 0.3 mg once daily\n\nTreatment of gout flares\n\nStandard dose: 1.2 mg (2 tablets) initially, followed by 0.6 mg (1 tablet) 1 hour later\nAdjusted Dose: 0.6 mg (1 tablet) initially. Repeated doses should be administered no earlier than 3 days later.\n\nFamilial Mediterranean fever\n\nStandard dose: Maximum daily dose of 1.2 to 2.4 mg\nAdjusted Dose: Maximum daily dose reduced to 0.6 mg, which may be divided into 0.3 mg twice daily\n\nProtease inhibitors\n:\n\nThis group includes atazanavir (reyataz), darunavir (prezista), fosamprenavir (lexiva) and ritonavir, indinavir (crixivan), lopinavir/ritonavir (kaletra), nelfinavir (viracept), ritonavir (norvir), saquinavir (invirase), tipranavir (aptivus).\n\nProphylaxis of gout flares\n\nStandard dose: 0.6 mg twice daily → Adjust to 0.3 mg once daily\nStandard dose: 0.6 mg once daily → Adjust to 0.3 mg every other day\n\nTreatment of gout flares\n\nStart with 0.6 mg, followed by 0.3 mg an hour later.\nDo not repeat within 3 days. Administering colchicine to treat gout flares is not recommended if the patient is already on prophylactic colchicine and CYP3A4 inhibitors.\n\nFamilial Mediterranean fever\n\nMaximum daily dose: 0.6 mg, divided into 2 doses of 0.3 mg each or taken as a single 0.6 mg dose\n\nDrug-Food Interactions\n\nGrapefruit juice may increase the serum concentration of colchicine. Therefore, the dose of colchicine may require adjustment when taking grapefruit juice. Patients should avoid grapefruit juice if they have hepatic or renal impairment and are taking colchicine.",
    "monitoring": "Colchicine has a narrow therapeutic index; however, no blood test is available to determine its serum concentration. Colchicine accumulation is associated with severe and fatal adverse drug reactions, especially in patients with hepatic or renal impairment or those taking a P-glycoprotein or CYP3A4 inhibitor. Parameters that require monitoring include a complete blood count and renal and hepatic function tests. Patients should be advised to report signs and symptoms of colchicine toxicity, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.",
    "toxicity": "The precise dose of colchicine that results in significant toxicity is unknown. Toxicity can occur after ingesting a dose as low as 7 mg over 4 days, while other patients have survived after taking doses exceeding 60 mg. In one review involving 150 patients who experienced a colchicine overdose, ingesting doses exceeding 0.8 mg/kg resulted in death.\n\nAcute colchicine toxicity usually begins within 24 hours of ingestion and includes gastrointestinal symptoms, eventually leading to significant fluid loss and volume depletion. In this initial phase, peripheral leukocytosis may also be present. Life-threatening complications often occur 24 to 72 hours after administration and are usually attributed to multi-organ failure. Death is typically a result of respiratory depression and cardiovascular collapse.\n\nTreatment of colchicine poisoning should start with gastric lavage and measures to prevent shock. Otherwise, treatment is symptomatic and supportive. There is no known specific antidote, and colchicine is not effectively removed by dialysis."
