    "clinical_significance": "Ventilator Bundles for the Prevention of VAE\n\nHospitals and critical care units frequently institute ventilator bundles to prevent VAEs. A bundle is usually comprised of several preventative strategies to optimize care of mechanically ventilated patients and to prevent the incidence of VAEs. There is no ideal ventilator bundle. Bundles may differ across hospitals, regions, and countries. Core components of ventilator bundles are, however, usually similar across different institutions. Ventilator bundles are aimed at reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay in the ICU or hospital, and mortality. The use of prevention bundles has proven beneficial in clinical practice, especially in reducing the incidence of VAP.\n[21]\n[22]\n\nKey components that typically comprise a ventilator bundles include 30 to 45 degrees head-of-bed elevation and semi-recumbent positioning to reduce the risk of gastric reflux, aspiration, and VAP; general infection control measures; peptic ulcer prophylaxis; prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis (DVT); daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs); spontaneous awakening trials (SATs); periodic interruption of sedation; maintenance of endotracheal cuff pressure between 20 to 30 cm H2O; subglottic suctioning using closed suction systems at frequent intervals and, oral care with chlorhexidine gluconate.\n[2]\n[21]\n[22]\nPressure care may be indicated, especially in patients who are mechanically ventilated for prolonged periods or in a prone position.\n[1]\nFurther strategies include early mobilization and conservative fluid management.\n[23]",
    "monitoring": "The monitoring of ventilator bundle implementation is often required for mechanically ventilated patients. Continuous education regarding the importance of monitoring and implementation of preventative strategies has shown to improve multidisciplinary awareness and adherence, thereby facilitating improved patient outcomes.\n[25]\n\nNursing staff typically play a key role in monitoring patients’ vital signs and clinical stability to detect acute deterioration in clinical status; alerting attending physicians to such deterioration; monitoring ventilator settings alongside respiratory therapists; responding to ventilator alert signals (for example alarm activation from acutely decreasing oxygen saturation); monitoring for decubitus ulcers and other complications and, monitoring patient requirements for sedation and analgesia.\n[26]\nAdditionally, monitoring as per criteria outlined in the CDC VAE surveillance framework is often included to some extent within the scope of nursing responsibilities.\n[5]\n\nAttending physicians and critical care specialists have the responsibility establishing diagnoses, instituting appropriate holistic management of patients; communication with patients and their relatives; monitoring of patients’ response to treatment in respect to clinical, laboratory and radiologic findings; conducting VAE surveillance in clinical settings; and keeping informed of up-to-date, safe treatment protocols (for example, local antibiotic programs on empiric treatment for VAP).\n[15]\n\nUltimately, the responsibility of interprofessional team monitoring, communication, and care coordination is shared among attending physicians, nursing staff, dieticians, respiratory therapists, speech therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, and all other involved health professionals to facilitate optimal patient outcomes."
