    "indications": "Cystinosis is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the\nCTNS\ngene, which encodes the cystinosin protein. This disorder affects an estimated 1 in 100,000 to 200,000 live births worldwide. Cystinosis is characterized by the accumulation of cystine within cellular lysosomes, ultimately affecting almost all organs.\n[1]\n\nRenal involvement, characterized by proximal tubulopathy, is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in nephropathic or infantile cystinosis and eventually leads to renal failure. Cystinosis is also the most common inherited cause of Fanconi syndrome in children. The 3 known forms of cystinosis are infantile (nephropathic), juvenile (intermediate and late-onset), and adult (benign, ocular, and non-nephropathic).\n\nThe infantile form is the most common and severe, accounting for about 95% of cases, and typically leads to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) by ages 10 to 12. Cysteamine, a cystine-depleting therapy, is the cornerstone of treatment for this disorder. Early recognition and treatment with cysteamine can delay the progression to ESRD and associated morbidities, resulting in improved overall outcomes.",
    "mechanism": "Cystinosis is caused by a malfunctioning protein named cystinosin, which is encoded by the\nCTNS\ngene on chromosome 17p13.2. Cystinosin is a lysosomal membrane transporter responsible for transporting cystine out of lysosomes. Biallelic mutations in the\nCTNS\ngene result in defective cystinosin production. More than 140 pathogenic mutations have been identified as causing cystinosis.\n[2]\nLarger or truncating mutations are associated with a severe form of cystinosis. Patients with these mutations typically develop infantile (nephropathic) cystinosis. In contrast, those with juvenile or adult forms usually have milder mutations, which allow some cystine transport out of lysosomes.\n[3]",
    "monitoring": "Polyuria is often the first notable sign of cystinosis, defined as urine output of more than 2 L/m\n2\n/d. Once polyuria is confirmed, it is crucial to assess urinary electrolytes, bicarbonate, glucose, and protein levels. All patients with Fanconi syndrome at a young age should be evaluated for cystinosis unless another cause is known, as cystinosis is the most common hereditary cause of Fanconi syndrome in children.\n\nCommon Diagnostic Findings in Cystinosis\n\nSerum electrolytes: Hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia, hyponatremia, and low bicarbonate levels\n[10]\nUrinalysis: Low osmolality, glycosuria, tubular proteinuria, phosphaturia, and bicarbonaturia\nArterial blood gas: Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis\nThyroid function: Evidence of hypothyroidism\nHemoglobin A1c (HbA1c): Elevated, indicating persistent hyperglycemia\nSex hormones: Low testosterone levels\nLiver function tests: Elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase\nVitamin D (1,25-OH): Low with normal vitamin D (25-OH)\nWrist radiography and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA): Low bone mineral density, leading to rickets and osteoporosis\nRenal ultrasonography: Nephrocalcinosis\n\nLeukocyte cystine levels and molecular genetic testing for pathogenic\nCTNS\nvariants are recommended to support a diagnosis of cystinosis. A comprehensive ophthalmological examination is also crucial and cannot be understated. Evaluation of leukocyte cystine levels requires a specialized laboratory. Results are expressed as half-cystine (with 1 molecule of cysteine being half of cystine) per milligram of protein. Generally, levels greater than 2 nmol half-cystine/mg of protein suggest cystinosis. Specifically, levels in the range of 5 to 15 nmol half-cystine/mg of protein indicate infantile cystinosis, while 3 to 6 nmol half-cystine/mg of protein suggest juvenile cystinosis. Patients without cystinosis typically have levels below 0.2 nmol half-cystine/mg of protein.\n[17]",
    "administration": "Systemic Cysteamine Therapy\n\nCysteamine is the primary treatment to lower cystine levels. This alkyl amine contains a thiol group that interacts with cystine in lysosomes, forming cysteine (half-cystine) and cysteine-cysteamine complexes. These complexes can be transported out of lysosomes via cysteine and lysine transporters, such as the PQLC2 transporter. Cysteamine therapy significantly delays disease progression and reduces morbidity and mortality across all forms of cystinosis.\n[10]\n[18]\n\nEarly treatment is essential, as it can significantly delay the progression to ESRD, improve growth, and reduce other complications of cystinosis. While cysteamine is generally considered non-curative and primarily delays symptom progression, patients still require aggressive hydration, nutrition, and electrolyte and bicarbonate replacement. However, a recent study demonstrated that early cysteamine treatment in infants can successfully preserve proximal tubular function, with normal electrolyte and bicarbonate levels observed into their second decade of life.\n[19]\n\nCysteamine is available in both immediate-release and newer delayed-release formulations. The immediate-release formulation should be initiated at one-sixth of the target dose, given every 6 hours, up to 1.3 g/m²/d for children aged 12 or younger and 2 g/d for those aged 12 or older or with a body weight of more than 50 kg.\n[17]\nThe delayed-release formulation can be administered every 12 hours with equal efficacy.\n[20]\nTransitioning from an immediate- to a delayed-release formulation typically results in a modest dose reduction.\n\nLeukocyte cystine levels should be monitored regularly, initially monthly and then less frequently as the condition stabilizes, to guide therapy. Cysteamine treatment aims to maintain a mean cystine level of less than 1 nmol/mg of protein in a blood sample taken 6 hours after the last cysteamine dose.\n[17]\n\nCommon adverse reactions to cysteamine include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, abdominal pain, headache, bad breath, sulfuric body odor, hallucinations, nervousness, fever, and skin rash.\n\nCysteamine increases gastric acid secretion, making gastrointestinal complications common and potentially leading to medication intolerance. Proton pump inhibitors can help alleviate these symptoms. Due to the metabolism of cysteamine into sulfur products, a bad odor may develop, which can sometimes be managed with riboflavin or chlorophyll supplements.\n[5]\nWhile rare, severe adverse reactions include seizures, neutropenia, and fibrosing colonopathy. Cysteamine therapy should be discontinued during pregnancy due to concerns about potential teratogenic effects.\n[21]\n\nTopical Ophthalmic Cysteamine Therapy\n\nSystemic therapy does not address corneal cystine deposition effectively. Topical ophthalmic cysteamine eye drops help prevent and reduce cystine accumulation in the cornea. However, adherence to this therapy is challenging due to the need for application 6 to 10 times daily.\n[22]\nThe gel formulation offers a more sustainable option.\n[23]\n\nProstaglandin Inhibitors\n\nCysteamine therapy does not alleviate symptoms of established Fanconi syndrome. Indomethacin, a prostaglandin inhibitor, has shown variable success in treating conditions such as Bartter syndrome and arginine vasopressin resistance (formerly nephrogenic diabetes insipidus), which involve water and electrolyte loss, resulting in polyuria, polydipsia, and failure to thrive. In cystinosis, prostaglandin inhibitors, such as indomethacin at doses of 1 to 3 mg/kg/d, have been used with similar aims and yielded variable outcomes. Precautions are necessary during periods of dehydration, and indomethacin is typically discontinued during these times. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be avoided with indomethacin, as their combined use can decrease glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and worsen renal insufficiency.\n\nTreatment of Complications and Comorbidities\n\nAdequate fluids, phosphate, potassium, and alkali replacement are essential to compensate for proximal tubular losses. High fluid intake is crucial during fevers, gastroenteritis, and summer months to prevent hypovolemia, which can worsen renal damage.\n[10]\n[24]\n\nCholecalciferol, calcitriol, phosphate, and alkali supplements help maintain bone health.\n[25]\n\nGrowth failure is common in children affected by this condition.\n[11]\nEarly initiation of growth hormone therapy is both safe and effective, regardless of growth hormone stimulation results or renal insufficiency.\n[26]\n\nCarnitine therapy has been investigated for muscle wasting but has not shown proven effectiveness. A high-calorie diet remains the primary treatment approach.\n[5]\n\nThyroid hormone replacement should be administered as needed.\n\nPuberty may begin spontaneously; however, many boys experience gonadal failure in the second decade of life due to cystine deposition in various parts of the testes, which leads to decreased androgen and sperm production. Both nonobstructive and obstructive factors can cause azoospermia. As gonadal failure is primarily due to end-organ failure rather than hypothalamus-pituitary dysfunction, gonadotropin treatment is ineffective for cystinosis-induced hypogonadism. Testosterone replacement should be provided as needed. Fertility preservation, including sperm banking and the option of future assisted reproductive technology, should be offered to all males starting in adolescence. Unlike males, females with cystinosis usually have unaffected gonadal function. However, chronic kidney disease and immunosuppressive therapy for renal transplantation (if needed) can somewhat limit their childbearing potential.\n\nSplenectomy may be required for splenomegaly or complications of hypersplenism, such as pancytopenia or anemia. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), patients undergoing planned splenectomy should receive pneumococcal, meningococcal, and\nHaemophilus influenzae\nvaccines at least 14 days before surgery.\n\nRenal Transplantation\n\nAs renal disease progresses toward ESRD, renal transplantation should be offered to patients. Although recipient monocytes may infiltrate donor kidneys with cystine crystals, renal tubular disease does not recur in the transplanted kidney. Renal transplantation generally has favorable long-term outcomes in cystinosis.\n[27]\nLong-term outcomes in cystinosis are generally considered superior to transplants for other etiologies.\n[5]\nCysteamine must be continued after the transplant to manage nonrenal complications.\n[28]\n\nFuture Therapies\n\nHematopoietic stem cell transplantation shows promise for treating cystinosis,\n[29]\nalthough current experience with this therapy is still preliminary.\n[30]\n[31]\n\nInflammation plays a significant role in cystinosis pathology, with macrophages contributing to the inflammatory cycle. Galectin-3, an inflammatory mediator that attracts macrophages, has been used in animal models, and decreased expression of this molecule in humans is believed to be part of the therapeutic effect of indomethacin.\n[32]\nOther disease-modulating therapies, including mitochondrial oxygen scavengers such as Mito-TEMPO, have also been studied. Other proposed agents under evaluation include anakinra, an interleukin-1 antagonist, and leptin receptor blockers. However, none of these have been approved for clinical use.\n[10]\n[32]",
    "adverse_effects": "Cystinosis affects almost every organ system of the affected individual, with kidneys being the most commonly affected organ. Early signs include proximal renal tubular acidosis, characterized by multiple substance leaks, leading to Fanconi syndrome. Over time, GFR progressively declines, proteinuria often increases, and ESRD may develop, requiring renal replacement therapy.\n\nRenal complications: Fanconi syndrome, dehydration episodes, hypokalemia, acidosis, hypophosphatemic rickets, and ESRD.\nOcular complications: Corneal cystine deposition causing watering, photophobia, blepharospasm, and hemorrhagic retinopathy.\nEndocrine complications: Growth retardation, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, and hypogonadism.\nNeurological and neuromuscular complications: Progressive loss of speech, memory, and intellectual function; cerebral calcification; and progressive myopathy causing swallowing and walking difficulties.\nSkeletal complications: Rickets, osteoporosis, renal osteodystrophy, and fragility fractures."
