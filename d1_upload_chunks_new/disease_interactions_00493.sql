Eighth cranial nerve damage may manifest as vestibular and/or auditory toxicities, including dizziness, nystagmus, vertigo, ataxia, tinnitus, and varying degrees of hearing impairment.  Nephrotoxicity is usually evidenced by tubular necrosis; increases in BUN, nonprotein nitrogen, and serum creatinine concentration; decreases in urine specific gravity and creatinine clearance; proteinuria; and cells or casts in the urine.  Rarely, renal electrolyte wasting may occur, resulting in hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypokalemia that may be associated with paresthesia, tetany, confusion, and positive Chvostek and Trousseau signs.  Although aminoglycoside- induced nephrotoxicity is generally reversible following discontinuation of the drug, death from uremia has occurred rarely.  Therapy with aminoglycosides should be administered cautiously at reduced dosages in patients with renal impairment, since they may be at increased risk for oto- and nephrotoxicity due to drug accumulation.  To minimize the risk of toxicity, patients should be adequately hydrated, the usual aminoglycoside dosage should not be exceeded, use with other neuro- and nephrotoxic agents should be avoided, and peak and trough serum aminoglycoside concentrations should be periodically determined and dosage adjusted to maintain desired levels.
