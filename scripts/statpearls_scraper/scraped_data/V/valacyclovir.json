    "toxicity": "Treatment of HZO primarily involves systemic antivirals, topical corticosteroids, cycloplegics, analgesics, and, in selected cases, systemic corticosteroids or adjunctive agents. While highly effective, these therapies can lead to systemic and ocular toxicities that require careful monitoring and management.\n\nAntiviral Therapy (Acyclovir, Valacyclovir, Famciclovir)\n\nCommon adverse effects:\nGastrointestinal:\nNausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort\nNeurological:\nHeadache, dizziness, fatigue, confusion (especially in older adults)\nRenal toxicity (acyclovir):\nCrystalluria, nephrotoxicity, and acute kidney injury\nManagement:\nEnsure\nadequate hydration\nto reduce crystalluria risk.\nAdjust doses in\nrenal impairment\naccording to creatinine clearance.\nMonitor\nserum creatinine and electrolytes\nin older adults and immunocompromised individuals.\nIf neurotoxicity occurs, a dose reduction or discontinuation is required.\n[71]\n\nTopical Corticosteroids (Prednisolone Acetate, Dexamethasone)\n\nCommon adverse effects:\nElevated intraocular pressure → steroid-induced glaucoma.\nCataract formation with prolonged use.\nWorsening of epithelial keratitis or risk of secondary infection.\nManagement:\nRegularly monitor\nIOP\nduring therapy.\nUse the\nlowest effective dose\nwith gradual tapering.\nAvoid unsupervised long-term use.\nAdd\nprophylactic lubricants\nto minimize epithelial compromise.\n[72]\n\nSystemic Corticosteroids (Prednisone, Prednisolone)\n\nAdverse effects:\nShort-term: Gastritis, hyperglycemia, mood changes, fluid retention.\nLong-term: Immunosuppression, osteoporosis, adrenal suppression.\nManagement:\nPrescribe\nshort courses only\nwhen indicated (severe inflammation, orbital involvement).\nUse\nproton pump inhibitors\nto reduce gastric irritation.\nMonitor\nblood sugar and blood pressure\nin elderly/diabetic/hypertensive patients.\nAvoid in\nuncontrolled infections\n.\n[73]\n\nCycloplegics (Atropine, Homatropine)\n\nAdverse effects:\nThese include blurred vision, photophobia, dry mouth, and flushing (systemic absorption).\nRarely, there are central nervous system effects in children (restlessness, hallucinations).\nManagement:\nUse the\nminimal effective dose\n.\nAvoid in narrow-angle glaucoma.\nUse caution in children and older adults.\n[74]\n\nAnalgesics and Neuropathic Pain Medications\n\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs:\nGastrointestinal irritation, renal impairment → coprescribe proton pump inhibitors in high-risk individuals\nOpioids:\nConstipation, drowsiness, dependence risk → limit use to severe pain\nGabapentin/pregabalin:\nDizziness, somnolence, weight gain\nTricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline):\nDry mouth, urinary retention, cardiac arrhythmias in older adults\nManagement:\nStart with\nthe lowest dose and\ntitrate gradually.\nMonitor for\nsedation, falls, and cardiac risk\nin older adults.\nConsider\nmultimodal pain therapy\nto minimize toxicity from single high-dose drug regimens.\n[75]\n\nAdjunctive Measures\n\nAntiglaucoma Medications:\nBeta-blockers (risk of bradycardia, bronchospasm), carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (electrolyte imbalance)\nAmniotic membrane grafts/surgery:\nMinimal systemic toxicity; risk limited to surgical complications and infection\n[76]\n\nPreventive and Monitoring Strategies\n\nBaseline investigations:\nComplete blood count, renal/liver function before antivirals and systemic steroids\nOcular monitoring:\nIntraocular pressure checks, slit-lamp follow-up, fundus evaluation for necrosis/vasculitis\nMultidisciplinary care:\nCollaboration with nephrology, internal medicine, and pain specialists for toxicity management\nVaccination:\nRecombinant zoster vaccine (Shingrix) reduces recurrence risk and medication exposure, minimizing drug-related adverse events\n\nToxicity management in HZO involves\nanticipating, preventing, and promptly treating adverse effects\nof antivirals, corticosteroids, and pain medications. Individualized dosing, renal adjustment, regular ocular/systemic monitoring, and interdisciplinary coordination are key to maximizing treatment benefit while minimizing harm.\n[77]"
