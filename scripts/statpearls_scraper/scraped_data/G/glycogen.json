    "indications": "Glycogen storage diseases (GSDs) are inherited inborn errors of carbohydrate metabolism that result in abnormal glycogen storage. The onset can range from neonatal life to adulthood, and clinical manifestations result either from a failure to convert glycogen into energy or the toxic accumulation of glycogen.\n[1]\n\nGlycogen is a branched polymer comprised of glucose monomers (see\nImage\n. Glycogen, Free Glucose Release, and Glycogen Storage Diseases, Figure 1). After a meal, the plasma glucose level rises, stimulating the storage of the excess in cytoplasmic glycogen.\n\nThe liver contains the highest percentage of glycogen by weight (about 10%), whereas muscles can store about 2% by weight. Nevertheless, since the total muscle mass is greater than the liver mass, the total mass of glycogen in muscles is about twice that of the liver. When needed, the glycogen polymer can be broken down into glucose monomers and utilized for energy production. Defects in the enzymes and transporters for these processes cause GSDs. An increasing number of GSDs are being identified, but most are very rare. These subtypes are classified numerically in the order of recognition and identification of the enzyme defect causing the disorder.\n[2]\n[3]\n\nClassification of Glycogen Storage Disorder\n\nGSDs that primarily affect the liver include the following:\n\nGlycogen synthase-2 deficiency (GSD type 0a)\nGlucose-6-phosphatase deficiency (GSD type Ia)\nGlucose-6-phosphate transporter deficiency (GSD type Ib)\nGlycogen debrancher deficiency (GSD type III)\nGlycogen branching enzyme deficiency (GSD type IV)\nLiver phosphorylase deficiency (GSD type VI)\nPhosphorylase kinase deficiency (GSD type IXa)\nGLUT2 deficiency or Fanconi-Bickel disease\n\nGSDs that primarily affect the skeletal muscles include the following:\n\nMuscle phosphorylase deficiency (GSD type V)\nPhosphofructokinase deficiency (GSD type VII)\nPhosphoglycerate mutase deficiency (GSD type X)\nLactate dehydrogenase A deficiency (GSD type XI)\nAldolase A deficiency (GSD type XII)\nβ-enolase deficiency (GSD type XIII)\nPhosphoglucomutase-1 deficiency (GSD type XIV)\n\nGSDs that affect both skeletal and cardiac muscles include the following:\n\nLysosomal acid maltase deficiency (GSD type IIa)\nLysosome-associated membrane protein 2 deficiency (GSD type IIb)\nGlycogenin-1 deficiency (GSD type XV)\nMuscle glycogen synthase deficiency (GSD type 0b)",
    "mechanism": "The etiology of GSDs is best understood by following the metabolic events leading to glycogen synthesis (glycogenesis) and degradation (glycogenolysis). Excess dietary glucose is stored in glycogen, and the synthesis of this molecule is, in part, accomplished by glycogen synthase. As indicated in Table 1, glycogen synthase has 2 distinct forms: one in the liver encoded by the\nGYS2\ngene and another in skeletal muscle encoded by the\nGYS1\ngene (see\nImage\n. Glycogen, Free Glucose Release, and Glycogen Storage Diseases, Table 1). Both enzyme forms work by attaching glucose monomers to growing glycogen polymers by creating α-1,4 links. As indicated in Figure 1 (see\nImage\n. Glycogen, Free Glucose Release, and Glycogen Storage Diseases, Figure 1), glycogen has α-1,4 and α-1,6 bonds between glucose units.\n\nAbout 95% of glycogen linkages consist of α-1,4 bonds. Mutations in the\nGYS2\ngene result in the absence or dysfunction of liver glycogen synthase, impairing glycogen synthesis in the liver and causing GSD type 0a. Similarly, mutations in the\nGYS1\ngene lead to the absence or malfunction of muscle glycogen synthase, disrupting glycogen synthesis in muscles and resulting in GSD type 0b.\n\nGlycogen synthase catalyzes the formation of α-1,4 glucose linkages in glycogen, but the glycogen branching enzyme (\nGBE1\n) is required to create the branching α-1,6 linkages. Mutations in\nGBE1\nlead to the production of abnormally structured glycogen, known as polyglucosan bodies, which is the hallmark of GSD type IV. These polyglucosan bodies accumulate in liver and muscle cells and do not effectively undergo glycogenolysis. In muscle tissue, this accumulation causes weakness and myopathy, while in the liver, it results in hepatomegaly.\n\nWhile GSD 0a and GSD 0b result from insufficient glycogen storage, most GSDs arise from defects in glycogenolysis, leading to glycogen accumulation. The initial step of glycogenolysis involves glycogen phosphorylase, which releases glucose-1-phosphate from glycogen. Mutations in the muscle-specific glycogen phosphorylase gene (\nPYGM\n) cause GSD type V, while mutations in the liver-specific glycogen phosphorylase gene (\nPYGL\n) result in GSD type VI.\n[4]\nThe glucose-1-phosphate produced is subsequently converted to glucose-6-phosphate by phosphoglucomutase. In the liver, glucose-6-phosphatase, encoded by the\nG6PC\ngene, converts glucose-6-phosphate into free glucose, which is released into the bloodstream as an energy source for other tissues and organs (see\nImage\n. Glycogen, Free Glucose Release, and Glycogen Storage Diseases, Figure 2).\n\nNotably, skeletal muscles lack glucose-6-phosphatase and cannot release glucose into the bloodstream. GSD type I arises from genetic defects in glucose-6-phosphatase metabolism. GSD type Ia, also known as von Gierke disease, is caused by mutations in the\nG6PC\ngene. In hepatocytes, glucose-6-phosphate is synthesized in the cytoplasm and transported into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, where glucose-6-phosphatase converts it into glucose. The glucose is then transported back to the cytoplasm and subsequently released into the bloodstream via the hepatic GLUT2 transporter.\n[5]\n\nGlucose-6-phosphate translocase 1 (G6PT1) is the transporter protein that facilitates the movement of glucose-6-phosphate between the cytoplasm and the endoplasmic reticulum. The G6PT protein consists of 3 subunits: G6PT1, G6PT2, and G6PT3 (see\nImage\n. Glycogen, Free Glucose Release, and Glycogen Storage Diseases, Figure 2). Mutations in the\nSLC37A4\ngene, which encodes the G6PT1 protein, cause GSD type Ib (see\nImage\n. Glycogen, Free Glucose Release, and Glycogen Storage Diseases, Table 1). Fanconi-Bickel disease, a rare glycogen storage disorder, results from GLUT2 deficiency due to mutations in the\nSLC2A2\ngene. GLUT2 deficiency impairs glucose export, increases intracellular glucose levels, and reduces glycogen degradation, leading to excessive glycogen storage and hepatomegaly.\n\nGlycogen is a branched polymer, with glycogen phosphorylase removing glucose from α-1,4 linkages but unable to act on α-1,6 linkages at branch points. A glycogen debranching enzyme (GDE) is required to remove these branch points. In mammals, this enzyme is called \"amylo-α-1,6-glucosidase, 4-α-glucanotransferase,\" encoded by the\nAGL\ngene. Mutations in the\nAGL\ngene cause GSD type III, resulting in either a nonfunctional GDE (GSD type IIIa or IIIb) or a GDE with reduced function (GSD type IIIc or IIId).\n[6]\n\nGSD type II is unique among glycogen storage diseases, as it is also classified as a lysosomal storage disease.\n[7]\nLysosomes are subcellular organelles responsible for recycling cellular macromolecules. Lysosomal storage diseases arise from the absence or dysfunction of a lysosomal enzyme. In GSD type II, the deficient enzyme is lysosomal acid α-glucosidase, encoded by the\nGAA\ngene. This enzyme breaks down glycogen into glucose for cellular energy. Mutations in the\nGAA\ngene lead to toxic glycogen accumulation within lysosomes.",
    "monitoring": "Laboratory Testing\n\nHypoglycemia should be documented by measuring serum glucose levels. In patients where hypoglycemia is suspected, a diagnostic fasting glucose test can be performed but should only be considered in a monitored inpatient setting.\n[13]\nHepatic GSDs (type 0, III, VI, and IX) are characterized by ketosis and usually yield a β-hydroxybutyrate level greater than 2.5 mmol/L. These diseases also typically present with hypertriglyceridemia and elevated liver function tests. Patients with skeletal muscle-associated GSDs may also have elevated creatine kinase levels and urinary myoglobin levels. GSD type I is associated with elevated levels of lactic acid and acidosis.\n[14]\n\nBiopsy\n\nAlthough specific genetic testing is now available for diagnosing most GSDs, histologic examination of liver or muscle biopsy is still used in specific scenarios. In GSD type 0, a liver biopsy typically shows decreased hepatic glycogen and can make a definitive diagnosis for this disease.\n[15]\nIn GSD type I, a liver biopsy should reveal pale-staining, swollen hepatocytes, steatosis, and nuclear hyper-glycogenation. Fibrosis is another common finding on liver biopsy in patients with GSDs and is predominant in patients with GSD type III, IV, and VI. In GSD type III, periportal fibrosis and micronodular cirrhosis are often seen with distended hepatocytes due to excess glycogen accumulation.\n[16]\n\nMuscle biopsies typically reveal diastase-sensitive vacuoles that yield a positive staining result with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and acid phosphatase in GSD type IV.\n[17]\nIn GSD type V, a muscle biopsy should demonstrate negative histochemical staining for phosphorylase activity. In the absence of phosphorylase activity, the specimen remains brown instead of taking up a deep blue hue. In addition, the biopsy should reveal subsarcolemmal deposits of glycogen detected by PAS staining.\n[18]\nIn patients with GSD type XV, muscle biopsies often show PAS-positive inclusions that are not digested with α-amylase treatment and, on electron microscopy, may be seen as filamentous material corresponding to polyglucosan bodies.\n[19]\n\nMolecular Testing\n\nMolecular genetic testing is noninvasive and, for the most part, available for diagnosing these rare genetic disorders. In some cases, genetic tests have eliminated the need for invasive muscle and liver biopsies. The table below outlines the genetic foci of mutations for these disorders.\n\nTable\nTable 2. Enzyme Deficiencies and Genes Involved in Various Glycogen Storage Diseases.",
    "administration": "GSDs currently have no cure, and most treatments aim to alleviate signs and symptoms. Critical goals include preventing and managing hypoglycemia, hyperlactatemia, hyperuricemia, and hyperlipidemia. Hypoglycemia may be avoided through starch consumption, with a commercially available, physically modified form now in use. In patients with GLUT2 deficiency, maintaining an antiketogenic diet leads to a significant decrease in liver size and glycogen content.\n[21]\nHyperuricemia is managed with allopurinol, while hyperlipidemia is treated with statins. Some GSDs, such as GSD type II, can now be treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) using recombinant alglucosidase alfa, which helps degrade lysosomal glycogen.\n[22]\nOngoing research explores the potential use of ERT for other forms of GSD.\n\nLiver transplantation should be considered for patients with certain GSDs that have progressed to hepatic malignancy or failure. While this procedure can correct hepatic failure and hypoglycemia, it does not address the cardiomyopathy associated with the GSD, which may continue to progress.\n\nThe immediate management of acute hypoglycemia involves rapid correction with oral carbohydrates or parenteral glucose. Glucagon is effective only in insulin-mediated hypoglycemia and will not help patients with hypoglycemia caused by a GSD.\n[23]\n\nThe following table provides a brief overview of therapeutic management for each GSD:\n\nTable\nTable 3. Management Strategies for Glycogen Storage Diseases.",
    "adverse_effects": "Even with appropriate dietary modifications, GSDs are associated with a wide range of serious complications. In early childhood, individuals with GSDs are at risk of hypoglycemia-associated seizures and cardiac arrest. In patients with GSD type Ia, growth delay with short stature, osteopenia, renal dysfunction, hypertriglyceridemia, and hepatocellular carcinoma can occur. In GSD type Ib, recurrent bacterial infections secondary to neutropenia may be seen. In GSD type IV, progressive liver failure with cirrhosis can occur. Cardiomyopathy and limb-girdle dystrophy can be seen in patients with GSD type II. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a classic complication of GSD type III.\n\nGrowth retardation and short status are also seen in GSD types IX (a, b, c, d) and XII, but a cognitive-developmental delay is also a feature of the latter. In GSD types V and XIII, exercise intolerance and rhabdomyolysis with an associated renal injury can occur. Rarely, end-stage renal disease requiring kidney transplantation may develop in patients with GSD type Ib.\n[24]"
