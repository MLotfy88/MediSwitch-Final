    "indications": "Migraine and headache disorders are among the leading causes of disability and morbidity worldwide.\n[1]\nMigraine is the most frequent primary headache disorder in children and adolescents. About 1 in 10 children experience recurrent headaches due to migraine, which can significantly impair school performance and quality of life.\n[2]\nUp to 18% of patients in the pediatric emergency room are found to be migraine-related.\n[3]\nHowever, migraines in children differ from those in adults because they are often associated with other symptoms, not only headaches. Migraine in children also manifests conditions like cyclic vomiting and abdominal migraine, wherein children are usually considered to have gastrointestinal tract disorder.\n[4]\nThe diagnosis of migraine in children and adolescents remains a clinical diagnosis. The clinician must obtain a detailed and comprehensive headache history that focuses on the pain's location, quality, severity, and duration. Nonetheless, complicated migraine is often associated with focal neurological symptoms such as ataxia, hemiparesis, or altered level of consciousness that concerns the examining clinician. Some episodic syndromes may show ambiguity, such as migraine triggered by trauma.\n[4]\n\nAcute treatment recommendations for children include using over-the-counter analgesics and triptan medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Preventive treatment strategies involve lifestyle modifications, behavioral approaches, and consideration of preventive medications with the lowest side effect profiles.\n[5]\nThere are evidence-based recommendations for the acute symptomatic treatment of migraine in children, which support the efficacy of using ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and triptans. However, no acute treatments were effective for migraine-related nausea or vomiting; some triptans were effective for migraine-related phonophobia and photophobia. Recommendations focus on the significance of early treatment, selecting the most suitable route of administration in relation to the characteristics of the migraine attack, and offering counseling assistance regarding lifestyle modification to prevent exacerbation of migraines, such as trigger avoidance and medication overuse.\n[6]",
    "mechanism": "Migraine is a primary headache disorder and a common, recurrent, disabling condition affecting an estimated 18% of women and 6% of men. There are commonly reported triggers that can induce migraine, namely stress, fatigue, various foods, alcohol, drugs, smoking, weather changes, and odors. Recent studies also provide new insights into the underlying pathophysiology and genetics of migraine that would provide novel pharmacotherapies for management and prevention.\n[7]\nChildren with migraine have a genetic predisposition activated by an environmental or physiological stimulus. These stimuli include exposure to drugs, diet, stress, or puberty. Most children with a history of migraines seem to have a positive family history.\n[8]\nSome studies have shown genetic contributions.\n[9]\nHowever, it is not fully proven yet. Genetic etiology is certain for certain types of migraines, such as hemiplegic migraine. Mutations have been reported in\nCACNA1A\n(calcium channel),\nATP1A2\n(Na/K-ATPase), and\nSCN1A\n(sodium channel) genes resulting in the development of hemiplegic migraine.\n\nMigraine is considered a strongly heritable disorder. Studies investigated the age of onset of migraine between successive generations. The age of migraine onset was significantly lower in the children with a history of maternal or paternal migraine than in their parents. Findings revealed that parental history of migraine showed that children with migraine were significantly younger at the first appearance of migraine than their affected parents.\n[10]\nMigraine is perceived to affect the relationship between the parent and child. A parent with migraines increases a child's risk of having a more severe migraine disease. However, children with migraine whose parent also has migraine seem to receive more early and aggressive treatment. The effect of migraine goes beyond the parent with migraine and influences children across biological, psychological, and social domains.\n[10]",
    "monitoring": "While the diagnosis of pediatric migraine is primarily clinical, lab testing and neuroimaging may be needed in certain circumstances.\n\nIndications for Lab Testing\n\nChildren with sickle cell disease may present with headaches in case of low Hgb. Blood work may be warranted for such patients.\n[35]\nA lumbar puncture may be performed if an inflammatory process or mitochondriopathy is considered the cause of the headache. Caution is advised while performing lumbar punctures as it can worsen the headaches by causing intracranial hypotension.\n[36]\nEEG may be performed in patients if there is clinical suspicion of seizures. Migraine-associated EEG abnormalities are relatively common: 10% to 75% in total (paroxysmal in 20% to 30%).\n[37]\n\nNeuroimaging for Patients with Migraine Indications\n\nAny neurological deficits, including but not limited to seizures, reduced visual acuity, altered consciousness, and deterioration of motor skills.\nEnlarged head in an infant or toddler.\nAbnormal ophthalmological evaluation, such as visual field cuts, disconjugate gaze, or abnormal fundus.\nHeadaches that always occur on 1 side (fixed unilaterally).\nRefractory headaches that last several days and are not responsive to treatment.",
    "administration": "Migraine treatment is warranted in children if the headaches prevent the child from going through daily activities like going to school, playing, etc. Since migraine is prevalent in children and impacts the cause of their disability, effective treatment is likely to result in improved outcomes. Previous studies suggested that a biopsychosocial approach that applies interdisciplinary multimodal care is most effective for treating pediatric migraines. Key elements are effective and timely acute pharmacological interventions (such as NSAIDs or triptans), education of patients regarding self-management techniques, psychological interventions such as biofeedback, relaxation, and cognitive-behavioral therapy.\n[38]\n\nThe treatment regimen can be both non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic. Non-pharmacologic measures include sleep hygiene patterns, diet, managing stress, exercise, and avoiding triggers. On the other hand, Pharmacologic treatment includes beta-blockers, calcium channel antagonists, serotonin antagonists, antidepressants, and antiepileptics.\n[32]\nAmitriptyline manifested a suitable effect on controlling headaches as well as adverse side effects. At the same time, nutraceuticals are found to be promising as effective drugs with fewer side effects. Coenzyme Q10 was observed to have promising therapeutic effects, especially in long-term use, with fewer side effects; however, amitriptyline presented a more rapid response.\n[39]\nMoreover, observational studies, randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses showed the efficacy and safety of single-compound nutraceuticals for managing migraine in children. The following nutraceuticals were reviewed: vitamin D, riboflavin, coenzyme Q10, magnesium, butterbur, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. However, due to low-quality evidence and limited studies, there were no definite conclusions on the efficacy of nutraceuticals for treating pediatric migraine.\n[40]\n\nProphylaxis should be considered when migraine symptoms cause frequent school absenteeism, poor quality of life, recurring emergency room visits, and frequent analgesic use. Since the majority of the patients can be treated with lifestyle changes and acute attack prophylaxis, a study was conducted to compare the efficacy and side effects of drugs used in migraine prophylaxis, such as propranolol, topiramate, flunarizine, and cyproheptadine. There was a significant improvement in all drug groups, but topiramate was found to be the most effective drug in reducing the frequency of attacks. All 4 drugs in this study may be utilized for migraine prophylaxis in terms of effectiveness and safety, with palpitations as the most common side effect.\n[41]\n\nTriptans plus non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reinforce triptan's effectiveness. lmotriptan and rizatriptan are effective as oral formulations. Meanwhile, sumatriptan and zolmitriptan are effective as both oral and nasal spray formulations. There are suggestions for considering dopamine receptor antagonists in cases of severe migraines.\n[42]\nA study evaluated the efficacy and safety of zolmitriptan nasal spray (ZNS) in treating migraine headaches in patients aged 6 to 11 years. Though the effect of high-dose ZNS on the primary endpoint of pain-free status at 2 hours was not statistically significant, ZNS was safe and well tolerated in this pediatric population.\n[43]\nIn addition, ZNS is rapidly absorbed from the nasal mucosa and can contribute to the fast onset of action. ZNS with a 5 mg dose was more effective in relieving headache pain, photophobia, and phonophobia and was associated with a more rapid return to normal daily activities. Findings showed that ZNS was generally well tolerated, with no serious adverse events, and may benefit patients with nausea or who cannot easily swallow tablets.\n[44]\n\nOn the other hand, another study revealed that sumatriptan and zolmitriptan nasal spray are above placebo in the 2 efficacy outcomes, but almotriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan with naproxen sodium, ibuprofen, and ibuprofen suspension were on top of placebo only in 1 of the efficacy outcomes. In addition, the findings showed that the best treatments for achieving pain-free effects are ibuprofen suspension, ibuprofen, and rizatriptan. In conclusion, most triptans and NSAIDs are effective in terms of pain-free or pain-relief. The most effective pain-free solution is sumatriptan with naproxen sodium, while for pain relief, the most effective solution is ibuprofen and ibuprofen suspension.\n[45]\nThis was supported by other evidence from small trials, which showed that ibuprofen improved pain freedom for the acute treatment of children with migraines. In general, triptans are also associated with higher rates of minimal adverse events.\n[46]\n\nTopiramate (TPM) decreases the frequency of headaches, and studies revealed that topiramate is effective and safe for migraine prophylaxis among children. The following are observed after TPM treatment: reduced headache frequency, severity, and duration.\n[47]\nProphylactic vitamin B12 therapy is used on migraine patients in adults, but limited studies were done regarding vitamin B12 and folic acid levels in pediatric patients diagnosed with migraine. Data showed a statistically significant difference between migraine patients and the control group regarding vitamin B12 and folic acid levels. The results indicated the requirement for routine evaluation of vitamin B12 and folic acid levels in pediatric patients diagnosed with migraine.\n[48]\n\nStrategies for Migraine Management\n\nCounsel patients about the possible trigger factors and subsequent avoidance. Maintaining a headache diary may help identify such triggers.\nRelaxation and biofeedback techniques with counseling about diet and proper sleep\nAnalgesics for intermittent headaches\nAntinausea agents such as promethazine and metoclopramide\nProphylaxis with a daily preventive medication\n\nRecommended Abortive Treatment\n\nAbortive treatment may be required for children with migraine headache attacks. In a study conducted in Israel, about 87.5% of children, during the first recorded migraine attack, reported intake of only 1 type of medication for each headache episode, particularly ibuprofen or acetaminophen, and less than 25% used dipyrone (metamizole). After 2 hours of treatment, the rate of improvement was 65.4% ± 27 for ibuprofen, 59.8 ± 35.3 for acetaminophen, and 50.9 ± 27.4 for dipyrone without statistical difference. It was also noted that male children responded significantly better to acetaminophen than ibuprofen (95% ± 28 vs. 75 ± 20). Although the most common abortive treatment is ibuprofen, the 1 that showed a better response was acetaminophen.\n[49]\n\nStudies compared the efficacy of oral paracetamol and oral ibuprofen for managing acute headaches in children with migraines without aura in India. There was no significant difference between the Paracetamol and Ibuprofen groups. This means that both paracetamol and ibuprofen are effective and safe for treating acute migraine attacks in children.\n[50]\nAt the same time, ibuprofen and paracetamol are included in the World Health Organization Essential Medicines List (WHO EML) as the 2 analgesics for treating acute migraine attacks in children. Meta-analysis and evidence assessments indicated that ibuprofen was superior to placebo for pain-free at 2 hours or pain relief at 2 hours, without difference in adverse events. At the same time, there were no differences between ibuprofen and paracetamol.\n[51]\nFor mild headaches - acetaminophen with a dosage of 15 mg/kg every 4 to 6 hours; ibuprofen 10 mg/kg every 6 to 8 hours; naproxen 15 mg/kg every 4 to 6 hours. For moderate to severe headaches, adding a triptan may be necessary. Rizatriptan and sumatriptan, along with a combination of analgesics, have been FDA-approved for use in children. Based on clinical studies, sumatriptan is an effective and well-tolerated treatment when administered intravenously, subcutaneously, or orally. Sumatriptan also relieves photophobia, nausea, headache, and functional disability.\n[52]\n\nThe protocol involves a non-opioid analgesic and dopamine receptor antagonist for emergency department treatment. Meanwhile, treatment with valproic acid is used as a continuous infusion. Administration of ketamine or propofol and peripheral nerve blocks could accelerate the treatment of pediatric migraine. Although there is an increasing variety of abortive treatments for pediatric migraine, there Is still a need for further research to validate these approaches.\n[37]\nA study compared pediatric migraine treatment efficacy in the emergency department before and after implementing a comprehensive migraine initiative in terms of standardized treatment protocol, provider educational series, and standardized physician documentation template. Results showed improvement in the efficacy and efficiency of migraine through a standardized treatment protocol, improved provider education, and ease of documentation.\n[53]\n\nRecommended Preventive Treatment\n\nPreventive treatment is needed during frequent migraine attacks, an impairment of the quality of life, severe accompanying or aura symptoms, and the failure of acute drug treatment. Below is a list of recommended pharmacological classes:\n\nAntidepressants\nAntiepileptics\nAntihistamines\nBeta-adrenergic receptor blockers\nCalcium ion channel antagonists, as well as onabotulinum toxin A and nutraceuticals (butterbur)\n[54]\n\nIf preventive medications are chosen, propranolol or nadolol (beta-blockers) can be given daily. Caution is advised in patients where beta-blockers are contraindicated, such as asthmatics, etc. Other medications that have proven useful include amitriptyline or nortriptyline, verapamil, antiepileptic agents (divalproex, topiramate, levetiracetam, and as used more in the past, phenobarbital and phenytoin), trazodone, and naproxen sodium. Studies are conducted to update evidence-based recommendations for migraine prevention using pharmacologic treatment with or without cognitive behavioral therapy in the pediatric population using the American Academy of Neurology 2011 process, as amended. Children with migraines who receive propranolol have at least a 50% reduction in headache frequency. Children receiving topiramate and cinnarizine have a decrease in headache frequency. Children with migraine receiving amitriptyline with cognitive behavioral therapy have a reduction in headache frequency. Other recommendations include counseling on lifestyle and behavioral factors influencing headache frequency and assessing and managing comorbidities related to persistent headaches.\n[55]\nMoreover, previous studies also evaluated the efficacy and safety of topiramate (TPM) for migraine prophylaxis. They found that TPM could be considered a safe and effective drug in pediatric migraine prophylaxis.\n[56]\nIn line with TPM, plasma calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) level may be used as a therapeutic strategy since it is higher in patients needing migraine prevention and responsive to short-term topiramate treatment. CGRP can also differentiate migraine from non-migraine headaches. These findings are clinically significant among young children who cannot identify their headache symptoms.\n[57]\n\nAnother study found that serum magnesium levels were significantly lower among children with migraine compared to those without migraine. Therefore, natural remedies such as magnesium, CoQ-10, ginkgolide B butterbur, riboflavin, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and oral melatonin have proven efficient and have a lower side effect profile.\n[58]\nSince most preventive migraine treatments modify the brain's excitation/inhibition balance or serotonin metabolism, they most likely produce unfavorable side effects. Biological therapies blocking CGRP transmission are effective and better tolerated; however, they are expensive and may not influence brain dysfunctions upstream in the pathophysiological cascade of migraine, including premonitory and aura symptoms. On the other hand, biochemical and clinical studies mentioned a complementary treatment strategy focusing on migraine pathophysiology's metabolic facet. Findings revealed that riboflavin and coenzyme Q10 are effective for migraine prevention and quasi-devoid of adverse effects. Their response rates are similar to those of topiramate, propranolol, and CGRP/CGRPrec mAbs but are weaker for thioctic acid. Therefore, metabolic treatments of migraine demonstrated an effective, well-tolerated, inexpensive, and evidence-supported therapeutic option for migraine prophylaxis and may be used as the first treatment line among children.\n[59]\n\nMoreover, another study evaluated the efficacy of riboflavin treatment among pediatric patients. Findings revealed that children treated with riboflavin had reduced frequency of headaches, acute medication usage, and absences in school. Riboflavin prophylaxis also demonstrated a reduction in migraine intensity and duration. Therefore, riboflavin is recommended as a safe, inexpensive, and effective nutraceutical in pediatric migraine treatment.\n[60]\nRecent findings on phytomedicines, or plant-based medicinal formulations, appear promising in identifying therapeutic targets in migraines as clinical and preclinical evidence of efficacy increases. Studied reviewed the mechanisms of action of the phytomedicines potentially useful for migraine, namely treatment-feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium), butterbur (Petasites hybridus), marijuana (Cannabis spp.), Saint John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) and the Damask rose (Rosa × Damascena). Findings for feverfew are mixed; butterbur is effective with potential risks of hepatotoxicity related to preparation; marijuana has limited data and mostly did not show effectivity in migraine treatment; Saint John's Wort shows relevant physiological activity but is a hepatic enzyme inducer; the Damask rose when used in topical preparations did not show efficacy in 1 clinical trial.\n[61]\n\nSeveral studies showed that melatonin is effective for adult migraine prevention and has been used acutely for procedural pain in children. For acute treatment of pediatric migraine, both low and high doses of melatonin are involved with pain reduction; however, higher doses and napping after treatment predicted greater benefit.\n[62]\nNatural remedies such as ginkgolide B butterbur, riboflavin, magnesium, CoQ-10, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and oral melatonin have also proven efficient and have a lower side effect profile. For status migrainosus, consider intravenous or intramuscular administration of a drug like valproate sodium (10 to 15 mg/kg), metoclopramide (5 to 10 mg), or prochlorperazine (2.5 to 5 mg). Previous studies mentioned that the majority of pediatric migraine patients are successfully discharged, and findings revealed that prochlorperazine appeared to be superior to metoclopramide in preventing a revisit. Diphenhydramineuse is associated with increased rates of return.\n[63]\n. Furthermore, ibuprofen, prochlorperazine, and other triptan medications are the most effective and safe treatments for the acute management of migraine and other benign headache disorders in the pediatric group.\n[64]\n\nA study assessed the efficacy and safety of a common monotherapy (intravenous [IV] metoclopramide) versus a combination strategy (adding IV ketorolac to metoclopramide) in children with acute treatment of migraine headaches in the emergency department. Findings revealed that the combination of IV metoclopramide and ketorolac failed to improve pain scores compared to metoclopramide monotherapy. Most of the patients were discharged with residual pain. The study also recommended counseling in terms of the following: reassurance of prognosis to the parents. trigger avoidance, the importance of lifestyle modification like proper sleep and water intake, and the importance of using analgesics at the early onset of headache.\n[65]\nHowever, some studies characterize the dystonic reactions to metoclopramide and prochlorperazine in children. It was revealed that dystonic reactions are rare among pediatric patients treated for acute headaches, but they are more common with prochlorperazine than metoclopramide.\n[66]\n\nOther studies mentioned that migraine is a response to a cerebral energy deficiency or oxidative stress levels that exceed antioxidant capacity. The ketogenic diet, which causes the elevation of ketone bodies (KBs), targets cerebral metabolism and has recently shown great potential in preventing migraines. Ketone bodies are an alternative fuel source for the brain and are thus likely able to bypass some of the abnormalities in glucose metabolism and transport found in migraine. Recent findings revealed that KBs-D-β-hydroxybutyrate could potentially influence other pathways believed to be part of migraine pathophysiologies, such as mitochondrial functioning, oxidative stress, cerebral excitability, inflammation, and the gut microbiome. However, further studies are suggested to check whether the absence/restriction of dietary carbohydrates, the presence of KBs, or both are significant for the migraine protective effects of KD.\n[67]\n\nRecent studies have been conducted to review the following treatment use in children, namely angiotensin antagonists such as candesartan, more selective 5-HT1F agonists like lasmiditan, new calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antibodies and antagonists, peripheral nerve blocks and botulinum toxin and electroceuticals which are therapeutic electric devices such as external trigeminal nerve stimulator (e-TNS), a non-invasive vagal nerve stimulator (nVNS), a single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulator (sTMS) and a remote electrical neuromodulation device (REN). However, there is still a lack of evidence for their effectiveness in children.\n[68]\nCounseling- Additional aspects of counseling include the following: reassurance to the parents about the prognosis, avoidance of triggers, the importance of lifestyle adjustments such as proper sleep and water intake, and the importance of using analgesics early in the headache. Addressing these issues may reduce the frequency and severity of headaches. Inadequate sleep might be due to obstructive sleep apnea, among other possibilities.",
    "adverse_effects": "Migraine complicated by prolonged neurologic signs has rarely been associated with a permanent neurologic deficit, and some of these cases may have been due to unrecognized metabolic diseases."
