    "indications": "Manganese (Mn) is an environmentally abundant essential metal required for numerous indispensable biochemical processes throughout the human body. Its function arises secondary to its inclusion within protein structures as a cofactor. Without its presence, the human body’s immune function, biochemical regulation of energy consumption, growth potential, coagulation, and hemostatic function, and mechanisms to remove byproducts of aberrant oxidative stress would be significantly diminished.\n[1]\n\nOptimal nutritional sources of Mn are derived mainly from plants, yet supplementation via vitamins or health products is another notable contribution. Drinking water often contains trace amounts of Mn, with specific cut-offs measured to prevent toxic exposures.\n[1]\nAnother beneficial source of Mn for infants is via breast milk and formula, which stave off deficiency during their critical developmental period.\n[2]\n\nManganese toxicity (manganism) is rarely encountered, yet it is important to recognize the consequence of occupational, accidental, or iatrogenic exposures to Mn. The main toxic effects attributable to this metal are extra-pyramidal side-effects that closely resemble symptoms of Parkinson syndrome.\n[3]\nThese adverse effects are secondary to its deposition in specific components of the basal ganglia and alteration of dopaminergic neuronal enzyme activity. Other prominent effects include cardiotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and increased mortality in infants.\n[4]\n\nThe most often documented etiologies for the development of manganism include chronic total parenteral nutrition (TPN) use in critically ill patients, consumption of contaminated well-water, and exposure through work in welding, smelting, and mining. The metal is readily absorbed through the intestinal tract, and absorption is variable based on the level of dietary intake, with biliary and pancreatic metabolism affecting excretion. However, these mechanisms are bypassed with IV administration, owing to the potentiality for manganism with IV preparations containing the essential metal.\n[2]",
    "mechanism": "There are several main mechanisms of manganese toxicity.  Manganism was first described in the 19th and 20th centuries in several studies of miners by Couper and Rodier, respectively.\n[5]\n[6]\nAlong with clear associations with the mining industry, welding, smelting, and the manufacture of batteries also play a key role in toxicity. Individuals involved in metal processing are also critically at risk.\n[7]\nThese environments are typically associated with an elevated atmospheric metal concentration, which is inhaled, leading to absorption and systemic effects.\n\nThe physiology of absorption of metals via inhalation has been postulated to occur via three routes:\n\nRetrograde axonal transport of Mn particles via olfactory and trigeminal nerve endings\nDirect transport across the pulmonary epithelium for absorption into the circulatory or lymphatic system\nIngestion via mucociliary clearance and swallowing of respiratory secretions\n\nThe size of the particulate matter inhaled also appears to play a role, with medium-size molecules depositing in the lower airways contributing the most to respiratory absorption.\n[8]\n[9]\n\nIngested Mn from plant sources is normally filtered through the liver, and the excess is removed to avoid toxicity. In individuals with hepatic dysfunction, patients are at higher risk of Mn toxic accumulation in the bloodstream.\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\nIn such patients, it has been found that blood Mn levels and basal ganglia. Mn deposits are significantly correlated with the degree of hepatotoxicity.\n\nAnother common source of concern for manganism is drinking water. Well-water specifically can accrue excessive amounts of the metal via breakdown from adjacent rock beds. Postulated means of Mn excess include the presence of anoxic water tables, carbon-rich soil, agricultural fertilizers, and run-off from sites of human deposition of materials rich in Mn (incorrectly disposed batteries, waste from mining facilities, sewer water).\n[13]\nIn countries with a high net Mn level in water sources, children tend towards deficiencies in IQ scores, memory, reasoning, and general academic achievement.\n[14]\nCurrent US guidelines suggest a measured Mn level in drinking water of fewer than 400 micrograms of Mn per liter.\n[15]\n[16]\n\nInfants who are breastfed obtain their necessary nutritional requirements of Mn without risk for toxicity. Those who obtain their main dietary intake from infant formulas may receive higher concentrations of the metal beyond that of typically accepted values. This is based on variability in formula ingredients and the reconstitution of formula with potentially Mn-toxic water sources.\n[17]\nThis risk is important to consider as infants lack significant biliary excretion mechanisms comparable to adults.\n[4]\n\nAlthough not much has been published with regards to chronic TPN use, case reports in children and data with respect to safe intravenous dosages of daily Mn suggest intravenous TPN as a potential etiology for manganism.\n[18]\n[19]\nGiven the lack of removal via pancreatic and biliary secretions, intravenous routes of Mn consumption can easily lead to toxic doses resulting in the feared neuropsychiatric complications described below.\n[4]\nToxicity can be attained via excessive exposure to gasoline, given the preponderance of the chemical methylcyclopentadienyl Mn tricarbonyl (MMT) in gasoline. This compound allows the phasing out of leaded gasoline, but concomitantly puts individuals at risk for manganism in the settings of chronic and excessive exposures.\n[20]",
    "monitoring": "The determination of optimal serum biomarkers for manganese toxicity has proven difficult. Given that Mn is primarily removed via biliary mechanisms, urinary levels are significantly low at baseline and do not reliably correlate with serum toxic levels.\n[77]\nDue to the short half-life of Mn, blood levels are also difficult to quantify, and chronic exposures do not consistently yield expected and clinically meaningful results.\n[65]\nSaliva sampling also yields significant variations in those exposed to the same levels of Mn, making it a non-specific marker for toxicity.\n[78]\nFurther, studies utilizing hair and nail concentrations of Mn as markers for toxicity again show inconsistent results, with some studies suggesting a reliable correlation and others showing a lack of reliability.\n[79]\n[80]\n[21]\nGrashow et al. suggested that nail sampling may be useful for quantifying exposure over a period of several months, but is not highly beneficial beyond.\n[81]\nMore recent research suggests a reasonable correlation between Mn exposure and hair and nails Mn levels while supplementing the notion that salival levels do not correlate well with exposures.\n[82]\n\nPromising biomarker capability was illustrated by measuring serum levels of both Mn and Fe together. Neil et al. utilized the ratio of Mn to Fe in both plasma (pMIR) and erythrocytes (eMIR) with respect to airborne exposure to Mn.\n[21]\n\nBone is a natural Mn sink, thus making it an ideal organ to study the effects of exposure to the natural metal. Liu et al. developed a novel testing system to quantify the Mn content in bone, called neutron activation analysis. They were able to reliably quantify Mn concentrations in the bones of hands, suggesting the viability of future studies with this methodology.\n[83]\n\nIn the context of recent or on-going exposure, MRI has also proven to be clinically useful alongside novel bone scanning. Mn, as described previously, preferentially accumulates within basal ganglia structures. The globus pallidus can be specifically analyzed by calculating T1-weighted signals and comparing it to frontal cortical white matter, creating what the authors called the pallidal index. Mn exposure can then be related to the degree of signal intensity as quantified by an increased pallidal index.\n[60]\n[84]\n\nNotably, these studies did not correlate with biological outcomes, as none of the analyzed population displayed clinical effects of manganism. These same researchers also studied the use of spectroscopy enhanced magnetic resonance studies. This technology allows the quantification of molecule concentrations in any portion of the brain. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy illustrated increased levels of GABA in the thalamus and basal ganglia of patients.\n[84]\n\nThe latest research presented at the 2016 conference on Mn neurotoxicity described new methodologies of identification of manganism, including the use of fMRI, PET scans, and new methods of using blood Mn and ferritin levels to detect globus pallidus accumulation of toxic metal concentrations.\n[85]\n[86]\n[85]\n[87]\n\nIn summary, diagnosis requires a high clinical suspicion alongside recognition of the risk factors placing patients at risk for manganism. Ideal evaluation for the determination of Mn toxicity includes a team-based approach, based on early recognition and outpatient referral to neurology for definitive care. Early consultation with a clinical toxicologist may aid in the identification of the etiology for the patient's symptoms. Usage of MRI or serum-based studies should be done at the request of specialists familiar with toxicity and the latest research.",
    "administration": "Treatment of manganism toxicity involves the treatment of the acute threats from toxicity and the management of chronic exposure. The most accessible form of treatment for manganism is the removal of the patient from the source exposure, whether the source is occupational, environmental, or iatrogenic.\n\nChelation therapy for manganism involves the use of CaNa2EDTA (EDTA) and Para-aminosalicylic Acid (PAS). The use of EDTA has been shown to effectively increase urine concentration of Mn and decrease blood levels of Mn. These findings did not coincide with the finding of decreased observed clinical toxicity, owing to the chronic nature of toxicity and incomplete reversibility.\n[68]\nHowever, EDTA prevents further Mn from crossing the blood-brain barrier, deactivating its ability to enter into the CNS to exert its toxic effects.\n[88]\n[89]\n[90]\nUnfortunately, EDTA has a poor bioavailability for brain parenchyma and does not appear to be able to completely reverse the toxic effects of Mn. Thus, in patients with chronic toxicity or advanced manganism, chelation therapy is likely to not reverse the significant clinical deterioration.\n[91]\n\nAnother chelation molecule, Para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) - typically used as an anti-tuberculosis medication - has shown clinical benefit for use in patients with manganism. PAS and its metabolites concentrate within the choroid plexus, brain parenchyma, and CSF, making it an ideal chelator for this toxicity.\n[92]\nPAS has the additional benefit of chelating both the Mn2+ and Mn3+ moieties.\n[93]\nThe anti-inflammatory properties of the salicylic acid component may also produce a beneficial effect, as studies have illustrated neuroprotective benefits from the use of other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications in Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\n[94]\n[95]\n\nPreviously attempted treatments included Levodopa (L-dopa) supplementation. Initial studies supported a benefit with L-dopa administration, but more recent data suggests prolonged treatment results in poor clinical response.\n[96]\nAlso, after the cessation of L-dopa use, patients had a progression of disease despite initial therapy.\n[97]\n\nSeveral vitamins and supplements appear to augment clinical response and provide a means of prevention for patients. In addition to chelation therapy, iron supplementation was shown to improve neurological symptom improvement compared to a treatment group that received chelation alone.\n[5]\nVitamin E was shown to prevent the supposed oxidative stress brought on by Mn-induced toxicity.\n[43]\nGlutathione and N-acetylcysteine have also shown to be beneficial in vitro for decreasing the downstream effects of Mn-induced cellular toxicity.\n[98]\nSeveral plants and plant extracts have also been shown to be beneficial, including Silymarin, Acai, Lycopene, Nicotine, and Melissa officinalis.\n[99]\n[100]\n[101]\n[102]\n\nNewer therapies being investigated include the use of taurine and Rasagiline. Taurine use decreases the toxic effects of Mn in vitro, mostly through the preservation of mitochondrial functionality in CNS tissues.\n[103]\n[104]\nTaurine also appears to ameliorate the learning and memory impairments associated with chronic manganism.\n[105]\nRasagiline is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAO-I) used to block the metabolism of dopamine in patients with Parkinson disease. Rasagiline appeared to offer a benefit through protection from reactive oxygen species created by Mn toxicity.\n[106]",
