There appear to be two types of interaction, an excitatory and a depressive one. Symptoms of the excitatory reaction may include agitation, headache, diaphoresis, hyperpyrexia, flushing, shivering, myoclonus, rigidity, tremor, diarrhea, hypertension, tachycardia, seizures, and coma. The exact mechanism of interaction is unknown, but may involve excessive serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (i.e., serotonin syndrome). The interaction is unpredictable and has been reported primarily with meperidine or fentanyl and various MAOIs including phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid, moclobemide, and selegiline. Fatal hyperpyrexia and hypertension have also been observed in animal studies with meperidine and phenelzine or furazolidone. In contrast, symptoms of the depressive reaction probably stem from potentiation of CNS effects by MAOIs and include respiratory depression, cyanosis, hypotension, and coma.', 'DDInter', 'Meperidine and fentanyl should not be used with MAOIs or other agents that possess MAOI activity (e.g., furazolidone, linezolid, methylene blue, procarbazine).

The exact mechanism of interaction is unclear. Certain systemic reactions stemming from parenteral iron therapy are thought to be mediated by inflammatory substances such as bradykinin in response to iron-catalyzed generation of toxic free radicals. Since ACE inhibitors decrease the breakdown of kinins, it is conceivable that they may potentiate these reactions. Anaphylactic-type reactions, including fatalities, have followed the parenteral administration of iron dextran. Such reactions occur most often within the first several minutes of administration and are generally characterized by sudden onset of respiratory difficulty and/or cardiovascular collapse. The extent of risk for anaphylactic-type reactions following exposure to any specific iron dextran product is unknown, but may vary among the products due to differences in chemical characteristics.', 'DDInter', 'Patients should be closely monitored during and after parenteral administration of iron dextran, regardless of whether they are being treated with an ACE inhibitor.

Resuscitation techniques and personnel trained in the detection and treatment of anaphylactic-type reactions should be readily available. Prior to the first therapeutic dose, a test dose corresponding to 25 mg iron should be injected gradually. Although anaphylactic reactions are usually evident within a few minutes, observe patients for at least one hour before administering the remainder of the therapeutic dose. Administration must be stopped immediately if signs of an anaphylactoid reaction are observed. Patients should also be closely monitored during each subsequent administration of iron dextran.

The use of quinolones has been associated with disturbances in blood glucose homeostasis possibly stemming from effects on pancreatic beta cell ATP-sensitive potassium channels that regulate insulin secretion. Both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia have been reported, usually in diabetic patients receiving concomitant treatment with an oral hypoglycemic agent or insulin. Although hyperglycemia is significantly more common and infection itself may be an underlying risk factor, hypoglycemia may cause greater morbidity and mortality.', 'DDInter', 'Blood glucose should be closely monitored whenever quinolones are prescribed to diabetic patients, especially if they are elderly, have renal impairment, or are severely ill. Due to the risk of profound and potentially life-threatening hypoglycemia, particular caution is advised during concomitant use of insulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylureas, meglitinides). Patients should also be apprised of the increased risk of hypoglycemia and be alert to potential signs and symptoms such as headache, dizziness, drowsiness, nervousness, confusion, tremor, hunger, weakness, perspiration, palpitation, and tachycardia. If hypoglycemia occurs, patients should initiate appropriate remedial therapy immediately, discontinue the quinolone, and contact their physician.

Specifically, inhibition of catecholamine-mediated glycogenolysis and glucose mobilization in association with beta-blockade can potentiate insulin-induced hypoglycemia in diabetics and delay the recovery of normal blood glucose levels. Prolonged and severe hypoglycemia may occur, although these events have rarely been reported. Significant increases in blood pressure and bradycardia can also occur during hypoglycemia in diabetics treated with insulin and beta-blockers due to antagonism of epinephrine''s effect on beta-2 adrenergic receptors, which leads to unopposed alpha-adrenergic effects including vasoconstriction. Other effects reported with various beta-blockers include decreased glucose tolerance and decreased glucose-induced insulin secretion.', 'DDInter', 'In general, cardioselective beta-blockers are considered safer than noncardioselective agents in the treatment of diabetic patients. Patients should be advised of the need for regular blood glucose monitoring and be aware that certain symptoms of hypoglycemia such as tremor and tachycardia may be masked. However, other symptoms such as headache, dizziness, drowsiness, confusion, nausea, hunger, weakness, and perspiration may be unaffected.', 'Others', 'In general, cardioselective beta-blockers are considered safer than noncardioselective agents in the treatment of diabetic patients.', 'Moderate', 'pharmacodynamic', NULL, 'https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/109757/', '[1] Zaman R, Kendall MJ, Biggs PI "The effect of acebutolol and propranolol on the hypoglycaemic action of glibenclamide."

Symptoms of hypoglycemia such as tremor and tachycardia may be absent, making it more difficult for patients to recognize an oncoming episode.

The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. Preliminary data from a small number of HCV-HIV coinfected patients receiving interferon-ribavirin therapy and different antiretroviral regimens containing stavudine do not support a major clinical impact related to the in vitro effect. However, the potential for diminished antiretroviral activity should be considered, as three patients in one study had an increase in HIV viral load of more than 0.5 log after 3 to 6 months of interferon-ribavirin therapy which led to discontinuation of ribavirin in one.
