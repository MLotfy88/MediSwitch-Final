It was initially approved by the FDA in 1991 [A174175].

It is primarily used for the treatment of respiratory, enteric and genitourinary infections and may be used instead of other macrolides for some sexually transmitted and enteric infections. It is structurally related to erythromycin [A174169].

Azithromycin [9-deoxo-9a-aza-9a-methyl-9a-homoerythromycin] is a part of the _azalide_ subclass of macrolides, and contains a 15-membered ring, with a methyl-substituted nitrogen instead of a carbonyl group at the 9a position on the aglycone ring, which allows for the prevention of its metabolism. This differentiates azithromycin from other types of macrolides [A174175].

In March 2020, a small study was funded by the French government to investigate the treatment of COVID-19 with a combination of azithromycin and the anti-malaria drug [hydroxychloroquine]. The results were positive, all patients taking the combination were virologically cured within 6 days of treatment, however, larger studies are required.[A192546]','["J01RA07", "S01AA26", "J01FA10"]','[]'),(29745,'Xeropium 0.4mg/ml 10 amp.','زيروبيوم 0.4مجم/مل 10 امبولات','100','','Antidote.opioid toxicity.opioid antagonist','Naloxone','Delta pharma','Amp','أمبول','0.4mg','10','العلاج والسيطرة والوقاية من الاكتئاب — علاج تسمم الكحول','about naloxone a ?-opioid receptor competitive antagonist narcotic antagonist. mechanism of action of naloxone naloxone is a pure semisynthetic opiate antagonist. it acts as a competitive antagonist at mu kappa and delta opiate receptors in the cns. it re','','',757,'2022-06-04',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Naloxone is an opioid antagonist medication used to block or reverse the effects of opioid drugs, particularly within the setting of drug overdoses which are rapidly becoming a leading cause of death worldwide.[A234594] More specifically, naloxone has a high affinity for μ-opioid receptors, where it acts as an inverse agonist, causing the rapid removal of any other drugs bound to these receptors.[A234594] When taken in large quantities, opioid medications such as [morphine], [hydromorphone], [methadone], [heroin], or [fentanyl] are capable of causing life-threatening symptoms such as respiratory depression, reduced heart rate, slurred speech, drowsiness, and constricted pupils.[A234594,L33724] If untreated, this can progress to vomiting, absent pulse and breathing, loss of consciousness, and even death.[L33724] Naloxone is indicated for the rapid reversal of these symptoms of central nervous system depression in opioid overdose.[A234589] It''s important to note that naloxone only works on opioid receptors within the body, and is therefore not capable of reversing the effects of non-opioid medications such as stimulants like [methamphetamine] or [cocaine], or benzodiazepines like [lorazepam] or [diazepam]. 

Also known as the brand name product Narcan, naloxone is currently available by intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (SubQ) injection, nasal spray, or intravenous (IV) infusion.[L33729,L33739] Naloxone IM injections are commonly available in the form of "kits", which is ideal for making overdose treatment accessible and readily available for administration by minimally trained individuals within the community.[L33734] Kits commonly include the supplies necessary to treat an overdose in a non-medical setting such as alcohol swabs, syringes, a rescue breathing mask, and instructions for use. Frequently also carried by medical and emergency personnel and at events known to be associated with heavy drug use like music festivals, naloxone kits are considered a key component of harm reduction strategies.

When injected intramuscularly (IM), naloxone acts within three to five minutes. Administration of naloxone is associated with very few side effects. Notably, if injected into a person not currently using opioid medications, there would be no noticeable effects at all. However, for individuals using opioid medications or experiencing an overdose, IM injection of naloxone rapidly reverses opioid effects and can cause the injected individual to immediately experience withdrawal symptoms.[A234589] Common symptoms of opioid withdrawal include nausea, vomiting, sweating, runny nose, aches, and diarrhea.[A234589] Although certainly physically uncomfortable, opioid withdrawal symptoms are not life-threatening; administration of naloxone is therefore appropriate for any person appearing to have any symptoms of an opioid overdose. Due to its short duration of action, persons injected with naloxone should be monitored for responsiveness and potentially injected a second time or taken to the hospital.[A234589]

Naloxone is also available within the combination product Suboxone with the opioid medication [buprenorphine].[L33714,L33719] Suboxone is used for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence and addiction.[L33714,L33719] When taken orally, naloxone has no pharmacological effect and does not reduce the effectiveness of the opioid effect of buprenorphine.[L33714,L33719] The primary purpose of including naloxone within Suboxone is to act as a deterrent to injection, as injected naloxone would rapidly reverse the effects of buprenorphine.[L33714,L33719]

Naloxone was granted FDA approval on 13 April 1971.[L33709]','["A06AH04", "N02AA53", "V03AB15", "N02AA55", "N02AX51"]','[]'),(29746,'Xerovirinc 500mg 18 f.c. tab.','زيروفرينيك 500مجم 18 قرص','42','','Antihelminthic','Nitazoxanide','Mina pharm','Tab','أقراص','500mg','3','','about nitazoxanide a synthetic nitrothiazolyl-salicylamide derivative antihelminthics in schistosomiasis. mechanism of action of nitazoxanide it excerts its action by blocking anaerobic energy metabolism. the drug interfering with the pyruvate-ferredoxin','6222003702123','',809,'2022-07-17',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Nitazoxanide belongs to the class of drugs known as _thiazolides_.

Almost doubling every 20 years, the prevalence of Alzheimer''s Disease is predicted to reach 66 million by 2030 and to 115 million by 2050 [F4366]. In December 2013, the G8 dementia summit concluded that dementia should be considered a global priority with the objective of developing a cure or a disease-modifying therapy by the year 2025 [L5953, F4366].','["N06DA52", "N06DX01", "N06DA53"]','[]'),(29825,'Zalkevor 5mg 10 f.c. tab.','زالكيفور 5مجم 10 اقراص','6','','Antihistamine.non-sedative.third-generation','Levocetirizine','El-obour > repharma pharmaceuticals','Tab','أقراص','5mg','1','','','','',762,'2022-08-02',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Levocetirizine is a selective histamine H1antagonist used to treat a variety of allergic symptoms.[A181748,A181790,L7694] It is the R enantiomer of [cetirizine].[L7694] Levocetirizine has greater affinity for the histamine H1receptor than cetirizine.[L7694]

It is primarily used for the treatment of respiratory, enteric and genitourinary infections and may be used instead of other macrolides for some sexually transmitted and enteric infections. It is structurally related to erythromycin [A174169].

Azithromycin [9-deoxo-9a-aza-9a-methyl-9a-homoerythromycin] is a part of the _azalide_ subclass of macrolides, and contains a 15-membered ring, with a methyl-substituted nitrogen instead of a carbonyl group at the 9a position on the aglycone ring, which allows for the prevention of its metabolism. This differentiates azithromycin from other types of macrolides [A174175].

In March 2020, a small study was funded by the French government to investigate the treatment of COVID-19 with a combination of azithromycin and the anti-malaria drug [hydroxychloroquine].

Daclatasvir is shown to target both the cis- and trans-acting functions of NS5A and disrupts the function of new HCV replication complexes by modulating the NS5A phosphorylation status [A19640]. The most common critical NS5A amino acid substitutions that led to reduced susceptibility to daclatasvir therapy occured at position Q30 (Q30H/K/R) and M28 in genotype 1a patients and Y93H in genotype 3 patients. 

According to 2017 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), 60mg of daclatasvir is recommended with 400mg [DB08934] for genotype 1a/b patients with or without cirrhosis as second-line therapy. The same dosing regimen can be used as first-line therapy in patients with genotype 3 without cirrhosis and second-line therapy in genotype 3 patients with compensated cirrhosis. Combination therapies that include daclatasir can be used for challenging-to-treat patients who have HIV-1 coinfection, advanced cirrhosis, or post-liver transplant recurrence of HCV [L863]. The therapy is intended to cure or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR12), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626]. 

Daclatasvir was FDA-approved in July 2015 for use with [DB08934] (Sovaldi) with or without [DB00811] to treat HCV genotype 1 and 3 infections. The SVR12 in HCV genotype 1a-infected treatment-naïve subjects without and with cirrhosis undergoing daclatasvir and [DB08934] therapy were 88% and 99%, respectively [FDA Label]. The same dosing regimen in treatment-naïve patients with HCV genotype 3 infection with or without cirrhosis achieved SVR12 rates of 71% and 98%, respectively [FDA Label].','["J05AP58", "J05AP07"]','[]'),(29900,'Zetacort cream 15 gm','زيتاكورت كريم 15جم','26','16.5','Antibiotic with glucocorticoid','Betamethasone+fucidic acid','Tabuk pharmaceutical manufacturing company > al ansar for marketing','Cream','كريم','15 gm','1','','description betamethasone is a type of medicine called a topical corticosteroid. corticosteroids are medicines used for reducing inflammation. skin inflammation in eczema occurs due to the irritation of the skin and is caused by the release of various sub','6223004710254','',1238,'2024-04-06',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(29901,'Zetakardoval 10/160mg 30 f.c. tabs.','زيتاكاردوفال 10/160مجم 30 قرص','168','','Anti-hypertensive. combined angiotensin blocker with calcium channel blocker','Amlodipine+valsartan','Adwia > zeta pharm','Tab','أقراص','160mg','2','','they are formulated in four strengths for oral administration with a combination of amlodipine besylate equivalent to 5 mg or 10 mg of amlodipine free-base with 160 mg or 320 mg of valsartan providing for the following available combinations: 5/160 mg 10/','6224008407317','',1266,'2022-06-28',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(29902,'Zetakardoval 10/320mg 30 f.c. tabs.','زيتاكاردوفال 10/320مجم 30 قرص','249','','Anti-hypertensive. combined angiotensin blocker with calcium channel blocker','Amlodipine+valsartan','Adwia > zeta pharm','Tab','أقراص','320mg','2','','they are formulated in four strengths for oral administration with a combination of amlodipine besylate equivalent to 5 mg or 10 mg of amlodipine free-base with 160 mg or 320 mg of valsartan providing for the following available combinations: 5/160 mg 10/','','',1386,'2022-07-12',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(29903,'Zetakardoval 5/160mg 30 f.c. tabs.','زيتاكاردوفال 5/160مجم 30 قرص','159','120','Anti-hypertensive. combined angiotensin blocker with calcium channel blocker','Amlodipine+valsartan','Adwia > zeta pharm','Tab','أقراص','160mg','2','يستخدم لعلاج ضغط الدم المرتفع','they are formulated in four strengths for oral administration with a combination of amlodipine besylate equivalent to 5 mg or 10 mg of amlodipine free-base with 160 mg or 320 mg of valsartan providing for the following available combinations: 5/160 mg 10/','','',2119,'2022-07-23',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(29904,'Zetakardoval 5/320mg 30 f.c. tabs.','زيتاكاردوفال 5/320مجم 30 قرص','219','','Anti-hypertensive. combined angiotensin blocker with calcium channel blocker','Amlodipine+valsartan','Adwia > zeta pharm','Tab','أقراص','320mg','2','','they are formulated in four strengths for oral administration with a combination of amlodipine besylate equivalent to 5 mg or 10 mg of amlodipine free-base with 160 mg or 320 mg of valsartan providing for the following available combinations: 5/160 mg 10/','','',1020,'2022-07-21',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(29905,'Zetamibe 10 mg 10 tab.','زيتاميب 10مجم 10 اقراص','35','','Hypolipidemic agent','Ezetimibe','Adwia','Tab','أقراص','10 mg','1','','about ezetimibe cholesterol absorption inhibitor 2-azetidinone derivative hypolipidemic agent. mechanism of action of ezetimibe it reduces the absorption of cholesterol from the intestine by localising at the brush border of the small intestine where it i','','',716,'2022-07-21',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Ezetimibe is a lipid-lowering compound that inhibits intestinal cholesterol and phytosterol absorption.

Zinc gluconate is a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) substance by FDA [L2081]. It is available as a trace mineral supplement and over the counter as a lozenge form for a reduced duration of common colds and with decreased symptom severity.

Although it has been nasally administered for treating the common cold, this route of administration has been associated with some cases of anosmia [A32414], [A32409], [A32410], [L2080].

Studies show that zinc may be better absorbed in humans in the gluconate form [A32412], [L2105], however, results from other studies may vary.[A27280, L2082]

Interestingly, zinc supplementation has become a critical intervention for treating diarrheal episodes in children. Studies suggest that administration of zinc along with new low osmolarity oral rehydration solutions/salts (oral rehydration solution), may reduce both the duration and severity of diarrheal episodes for up to 12 weeks [L422].

It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infections along with other antibiotics including [DB01060], [DB01211], and [DB00916], for example.[A177271, F4498] Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [DB00338], [DB00213], [DB00448], [DB05351], and [DB01129]. Esomeprazole is the s-isomer of [DB00338], which is a racemate of the S- and R-enantiomer. Esomeprazole has been shown to inhibit acid secretion to a similar extent as [DB00338], without any significant differences between the two compounds _in vitro_. 

Esomeprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of esomeprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, esomeprazole''s duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]

PPIs such as esomeprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as esomeprazole has been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients such as iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]

Rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as esomeprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion.[A177574] Esomeprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing to prevent this rebound effect.','["A02BD06", "A02BC05", "M01AE52"]','[]'),(30015,'Azemibe 10/20mg 10 f.c. tabs.','ازيميب 10/20 مجم 10 اقراص','33','','Antihyperlipidemic.cholesterol absorption inhibitors.combined with statin','Atorvastatin+ezetimibe','Innovision pharm','Tab','أقراص','20mg','1','','','','',880,'2022-10-05',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(30017,'Zonacip ear drops 15 ml','زوناسيب نقط للاذن 15 مل','12','','Antibiotic with glucocorticoid','Ciprofloxacin+dexamethasone','Pharopharma','Drops','نقط','15 ml','1','','about ciprofloxacin it is a broad spectrum fluoroquinolone with activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. eye drops: it is a fluroquinolone antibacterial having broad spectrum of activity. mechanism of action of ciprofloxacin ciprofloxacin is a bacteriosta','','',951,'2022-07-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(30019,'Zondex gel 75 gm','زوندكس جل 75جم','69','55','Massage','Glautheria oil+willow bark extract+eucalyptus oil+turpentine oil+thyme oil','Leader cosmetics > advance pharma-egypt','Gel','جل','75 gm','1','','massage gel','','',998,'2024-04-25',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(30021,'Zondex massage spray 100 ml','زوندكس سبراي مساج 100 مل','85','69','Massage','Eucalyptus+grape+willow+thyme+terpene oil','Avex pharma','Spray','بخاخ','100 ml','1','اسبراي مساج للشد العضلي -- علاج الالام العضلات -- استرخاء العضلات','','','',1998,'2024-04-25',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(30022,'Zone cream 50 gm','زون كريم 50جم','60','','Whitening topical','Stearic acid+ascorbic acid+chamomile extract+propylene glycol','Egyptian company for cosmetics','Cream','كريم','50 gm','1','','whitening cream','','',820,'2022-07-13',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(30023,'Zonex soap 100 gm','زونكس صابون 100جم','25','','Soap','','Macro group pharmaceuticals','Soap','صابون','100 gm','1','','*medicated soap with its unique blend of very effective ingredients in skin whitening cleansing and lightening. *characterized by liquorice extract & vitamin e that reduce skin melanin pigment formation. *has a combination of glycolic acid & salicylic aci','','',1233,'2022-07-10',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(30024,'Zonivan 100 mg 20 caps','زونيفان 100مجم 20 كبسول','76','56','Anti-epileptic.sulfonamides','Zonisamide','Horus for pharmaceutical products','Cap','كبسولة','100 mg','2','','','','',908,'2025-08-15',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Zonisamide is a sulfonamide anticonvulsant used as an adjunctive therapy in adults with partial-onset seizures.[L42530,L42535]  Zonisamide may act by blocking repetitive firing of voltage-gated sodium channels, leading to a reduction of T-type calcium channel currents or by binding allosterically to GABA receptors.

More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Rosuvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [simvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] This is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than [atorvastatin]''s effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial[A181427] concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.

Rosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]','["C10BX10", "C10BX05", "C10BX07", "C10AA07", "A10BH52", "G01AE10", "C10BX13", "C10BX09", "C10BA09", "C10BX16", "C10BX17", "C10BX14", "C10BA06"]','[]'),(30050,'Aaa','ششش','60','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',755,'2022-07-31',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(30052,'Zymar 0.3% ophthalmic sol. 5 ml','زيمار 0.3% محلول للعين 5مل','33','','Antibiotic.quinolone','Gatifloxacin','Allergan > soficopharm','Sol','محلول','0.3%','1','','','','',811,'2022-07-21',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Gatifloxacin is an antibiotic agent and a member of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolone family.

Gout is closely associated with hyperuricemia. Febuxostat works by inhibiting the activity of an enzyme that is responsible for the synthesis of uric acid, thereby reducing serum uric acid levels.[A230548] 

In February 2019, a black box warning for febuxostat was added, based on the findings of a post-market clinical study (the CARES trial) where there was an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) fatal outcomes in patients with gout and known cardiovascular disease treated with febuxostat, when compared to those treated with allopurinol. The manufacturer and the FDA advise health professionals to limit the use of febuxostat to second-line therapy in patients who have inadequate response or intolerance to allopurinol, and to avoid the use of febuxostat in patients with cardiovascular diseases.[A2742, L13056]','["M04AA03"]','[]'),(30138,'Andovit immune vit. c 1000 mg 20 tabs.','اندوفيت اميون فيتامين سي 1000مجم 20 قرص','60','','Multivitamin','Vitamin c+vitamin d3+zinc','Andalous pharma','Tab','أقراص','1000 mg','2','1- معزز ومقوي للمناعة','vitamin c ... 1000 mg vitamin d3 .... zinc ..... water soluble vitamin antioxidant. mechanism of action of vitamin c vitamin c exerts it`s action by influencing the biologic oxidations and reductions used in cellular respirations. it directly stimulates c','','',3642,'2023-03-01',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL);

Esomeprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus.

PPIs such as esomeprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health.

By inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver, statins lower abnormal cholesterol and lipid levels, and ultimately reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid. This conversion is a critical metabolic reaction involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport, including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing statins is considered standard practice for patients following any cardiovascular event, and for people who are at moderate to high risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The evidence supporting statin use, coupled with minimal side effects and long term benefits, has resulted in wide use of this medication in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Atorvastatin and other statins including [lovastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [simvastatin] are considered first-line treatment options for dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] The increasing use of this class of drugs is largely attributed to the rise in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (such as heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke) in many countries.[A181084] An elevated cholesterol level (elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in particular) is a significant risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Several landmark studies demonstrate that the use of statins is associated with both a reduction in LDL levels and CVD risk.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins were shown to reduce the incidences of all-cause mortality, including fatal and non-fatal CVD, as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Some evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within five years) statin use leads to a 20%-22% relative reduction in the number of major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

Atorvastatin was first synthesized in 1985 by Dr. Bruce Roth and approved by the FDA in 1996.[T568] It is a pentasubstituted pyrrole [A177415] formed by two contrasting moieties with an achiral heterocyclic core unit and a 3,5-dihydroxypentanoyl side chain identical to its parent compound.[T571] Unlike other members of the statin group, atorvastatin is an active compound and therefore does not require activation.[A177436]','["C10BA05", "C10BX11", "C10BX12", "C10BX18", "C10AA05", "C10BX15", "C10BX03", "C10BX08", "C10BX06"]','[]'),(30217,'Botox allergan 100 units vial pd. for inj.','بوتوكس اليرجان 100وحدة فيال للحقن','4,934','3450','.','Botulinum toxin','Allergan','Inj','حقن','','1','','','','',1389,'2024-11-30',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'M03AX01',NULL),(30219,'Branca 20 tablet','برانكا 20 قرص','65','48','Multivitamin','Calcium+vitamin d3+mg+vitamin k2','Brand nutrition > force pharma','Tablet','أقراص','','2','مكمل غذائى لدعم نمو العظام والوقاية من الكساح وهشاشة العظام','','','',4116,'2024-08-03',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(30224,'Brano 20 peices','برانو 20 قطعة','85','65','Iron supplement','Iron+lactoferrin+zinc+vit.c','Brand nutrition > brand pharma','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','iron deffecincy- anemia','','',690,'2025-08-15',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(30225,'Breathovance nebulizer soln. 20 amp. 2.5ml','بريثوفانس محلول للاستنشاق 20 امبول 2.5 مل','90','65','Anti-muscarinic.asthma.combined with beta agonist','Ipratropium bromide+salbutamol','Global advanced pharmaceuticals (gap)','Amp','أمبول','2.5ml','20','مضاد للربو ,علاج ازمات التنفس و الانسداد الرئوى المزمن','about ipratropium bromide anticholinergic muscarinic antagonist tropane derivative bronchodilator( anti asthma) mechanism of action of ipratropium bromide ipratropium bromide selectively acts on bronchial muscle without altering volume or consistency of r','','',5456,'2023-09-04',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(30226,'Brett vaginal wash 250 ml','بريت تشطيف مهبلي 250 مل','70','55','Vaginal care','','Leader cosmetics & perfumes co. > kmt pharma','Vaginal wash','غسول مهبلي','250 ml','1','','brett is the ideal vaginal cleanser in treating vaginitis. *eliminate all vaginitis causes by: -normalizing vaginal ph. -the power of 5 biocide agents. *eliminate all vaginitis symptoms: -anti-inflammatory effect. -antihistaminic effect. -foaming & deodor','','',1555,'2024-11-19',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL);

Salbutamol is formulated as a racemic mixture of the R- and S-isomers. The R-isomer has 150 times greater affinity for the beta2-receptor than the S-isomer and the S-isomer has been associated with toxicity. This lead to the development of levalbuterol, the single R-isomer of salbutamol. However, the high cost of levalbuterol compared to salbutamol has deterred wide-spread use of this enantiomerically pure version of the drug. Salbutamol is generally used for acute episodes of bronchospasm caused by bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis and other chronic bronchopulmonary disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD).

As of October 31, 2017 the FDA approved Astra Zeneca''s orally administered Calquence (acalabrutinib, capsules). This Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor indicated for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, small lymphocytic lymphoma, and in adult patients with Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have already received at least one prior therapy.[L10241] In August 2022, the FDA approved a new tablet formulation of Calquence, enabling the co-administration of this drug with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).[L42795,L42800] Unlike Calquence capsules, the co-administration of Calquence tablets and PPIs does not have an effect in the pharmacokinetics of acalabrutinib.[L10241,L42795]

Also known as ACP-196, acalabrutinib is also considered a second generation BTK inhibitor because it was rationally designed to be more potent and selective than ibrutinib, theoretically expected to demonstrate fewer adverse effects owing to minimized bystander effects on targets other than BTK.

Nevertheless, acalabrutinib was approved under the FDA''s accelerated approval pathway, which is based upon overall response rate and faciliates earlier approval of medicines that treat serious conditions or/and that fill an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint. Continued approval for acalabrutinib''s currently accepted indication may subsequently be contingent upon ongoing verification and description of clinical benefit in confimatory trials.

Appropriate levels of vitamin D must be upheld in the body in order to maintain calcium and phosphorus levels in a healthy physiologic range to sustain a variety of metabolic functions, transcription regulation, and bone metabolism [A223, L5689, L1782, L5771, F4027, F4042, F4048].

The result of doing so allows cGMP present in both the penis and pulmonary vasculature to elicit smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation that subsequently facilitates relief in pulmonary arterial hypertension and the increased flow of blood into the spongy erectile tissue of the penis that consequently allows it to grow in size and become erect and rigid [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

Interestingly enough, it is precisely via this mechanism why sildenafil was at first researched as a potential treatment for angina - or chest pain associated with inadequate blood flow to the heart - before being serendipitously indicated for treating erectile dysfunction in the late 1980s [A175732]. Nevertheless, it is because of this mechanism that sildenafil is also indicated for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension but is also additionally notorious for interacting with various anti-anginal or anti-hypertensive agents to develop potentially rapid, excessive, and/or fatal hypotensive crises [A175579, A175582, A175654].

Regardless, sildenafil, among a variety of other similar or related PDE5 inhibitors, has become a common and effective treatment for erectile dysfunction and since its formal approval for medical use in the public in 1998 [A175732], continues to see millions of prescriptions written for it internationally. Although the medication has historically been most popularly recognized as Pfizer''s brand name Viagra, sildenafil is currently available generically and even as a non-prescription over the counter medication in some countries [L5656].','["G01AE10", "G04BE03"]','[]'),(30425,'Dott hair cream 100 gram','دوت كريم للشعر 100 جم','140','110','Nourishing cream','Caffeine+dimethicone+simethicone+panthenol+argan oil+olive oil+vit e+almond oil+bees wax+wheat germ oil+sunflower flower oil+jojoba oil','Hi care > theia pharma','Cream','كريم','','1','','hair nourishing cream','','',1802,'2024-10-31',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(30427,'Dozova melatonin 5 mg 60 caps.','دوزوفا ميلاتونين 5مجم 60 كبسولة','249','190','Puritans pride - sleep aid','Melatonin','Zeta pharma','Cap','كبسولة','5 mg','6','','','','',888,'2024-07-29',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Melatonin is a biogenic amine that is found in animals, plants and microbes. Aaron B. Lerner of Yale University is credited for naming the hormone and for defining its chemical structure in 1958.  In mammals, melatonin is produced by the pineal gland. The pineal gland is small endocrine gland, about the size of a rice grain and shaped like a pine cone (hence the name), that is located in the center of the brain (rostro-dorsal to the superior colliculus) but outside the blood-brain barrier. The secretion of melatonin increases in darkness and decreases during exposure to light, thereby regulating the circadian rhythms of several biological functions, including the sleep-wake cycle. In particular, melatonin regulates the sleep-wake cycle by chemically causing drowsiness and lowering the body temperature.  Melatonin is also implicated in the regulation of mood, learning and memory, immune activity, dreaming, fertility and reproduction. Melatonin is also an effective antioxidant.  Most of the actions of melatonin are mediated through the binding and activation of melatonin receptors. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may have lower than normal levels of melatonin. A 2008 study found that unaffected parents of individuals with ASD also have lower melatonin levels, and that the deficits were associated with low activity of the ASMT gene, which encodes the last enzyme of melatonin synthesis. Reduced melatonin production has also been proposed as a likely factor in the significantly higher cancer rates in night workers.','["N05CH01"]','[]'),(30431,'Aaa','ششش','13','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','0','','','','',578,'2022-11-05',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL);
