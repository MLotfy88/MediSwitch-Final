    "indications": "Tooth polishing is contraindicated in the case of intrinsic stains that may be caused by developmental defects or environmental or drug-induced factors, such as the following:\n\nEnamel hypoplasia\nHypomineralization\nDentigoneses imperfecta\nAmelogenesis imperfecta\nDental fluorosis\nTetracyclines stains\n[12]\n\nOther contraindications include:\n\nAcute diseases of the gingiva and periodontal structures\nGingival recessions\nSensitive teeth\nNewly erupted teeth\nXerostomia\nAllergy to paste ingredients\n[7]",
    "clinical_significance": "Extrinsic stains are widespread in dental practice because they can be caused by tobacco smoking or simply drinking too much coffee or tea. The tooth polishing devices are selected according to each case, and treatment plans are selectively designed, taking into account the patient's needs and with concern about minimal damage to the teeth and periodontal structures.\n\nExtrinsic stains are 1 of the factors that influence tooth color assessment. Performing professional dental prophylaxis before composite or ceramic color selection in anterior teeth restorations could increase treatment predictability.\n[18]"
