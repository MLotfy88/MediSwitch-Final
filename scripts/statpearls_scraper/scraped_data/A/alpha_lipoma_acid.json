    "indications": "The omentum is an intraabdominal organ connected to the spleen, stomach, pancreas, and colon, served by the left and right gastroepiploic arteries. The omentum is visceral adipose comprising a single layer of mesothelial cells sandwiched by connective tissue containing fibroblasts, adipocytes, mesothelium, endothelium, mast cells, lymphocytes, granulocytes, macrophages, blood vessels, connective tissue, and angiogenic and immunogenic pluripotent cells lines. The omentum plays a role in peritoneal homeostasis, including fluid and solute transport, tissue and cellular repair, angiogenesis, infection control, and lipid storage, and serves as a reservoir for stem cells.\n[1]\n\nImmune cells move among omental regions via fenestrations. Milky spots are areas of immune cells arranged around blood vessels near fenestrations, allowing inflammatory cell egress into the peritoneal cavity; these areas are upregulated during active infection. Milky spots also aid perfusion, absorb fluid, and synthesize and release neurotransmitters associated with sympathetic nerves, including dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and choline acetyltransferase. The lymphatics from milky spots drain to the subpyloric and splenic lymph nodes.\n[1]\n\nStem cells within the omentum promote angiogenesis by producing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF). Inflammation and hypoxia can drive VEGF expression; these cytokines promote the migration of neural stem cells to the injury site. Laminin within the omental stroma produces vasoactive growth factor and neurotrophic factor. Mechanisms have been proposed for the role of the omentum in stroke recovery, treatment for Alzheimer Disease, and increasing perfusion to ischemic limbs.\n[2]\n\nThe omentum is a frequent site of malignant transformation and metastatic disease. Immune cells within the milky spots are thought to mitigate inflammation and contribute to the spread of malignancy. Milky spots likely behave as secondary lymphoid organs, able to mount responses to peritoneal antigens and generate and differentiate peritoneal macrophages. Still, the omental milieu, including milky spots, mesenchymal cells, and adipocytes, is favorable for promoting metastatic disease.\n[3]\n[4]\nMetastates to the omentum often confer a worse prognosis compared to metastases at other sites, as the omentum contributes to chemoresistance and propagation of tumor.\n[5]\n\nMalignancies can arise from omental cell lines, leading to a primary omental tumor. Primary omental tumors are rare and frequently presented as case reports. Primary omental malignancies include liposarcoma, hemangiopericytoma, fibrosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, mesothelioma, and malignant fibrous histiocytoma; indolent processes such as intraabdominal desmoid tumor have been reported.\n[6]\nMore commonly, the omentum is the site of a variety of metastatic processes, most commonly uterine, ovarian, colorectal, and gastric cancers. Of note, a gastrointestinal stromal tumor may originate primarily from the omentum or be located within the omentum as metastatic disease. The omentum is also a frequent site for inflammatory processes that may be difficult to distinguish from malignancies.\n[7]\n[8]",
    "mechanism": "Metastatic seeding of the omentum is common, but primary omental tumors are rare. Hemangiopericytoma, arising from the pericytes of Zimmerman, is one of the most commonly reported primary tumors of the omentum.\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\nCases of omental rhabdomyosarcoma, small cell carcinoma, malignant solitary fibrous tumor, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, lipomas, yolk sac tumor, and angiofibrolipoma have been reported.\n[6]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\nPrimary omental mesothelioma is related to asbestos exposure.\n[21]\nGastrointestinal stromal tumors, usually metastatic to the omentum, can rarely arise primarily within the omentum.\n[22]\n\nAccording to the 2020 World Health Organization (WHO) soft tissue tumor classification, most sarcomas originating in omentum are soft tissue tumors. Soft tissue sarcoma is derived from mesenchymal tissue cells. Liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma are the most common intraabdominal soft tissue sarcoma but rarely occur within the omentum as a primary tumor. Liposarcoma originates from primitive mesenchymal cells and is composed of lipoblasts.\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\nDesmoplastic round cell tumor of the omentum, a mesenchymal tumor, results from a chromosomal translocation that fuses the Ewing sarcoma and Wilm tumor suppressor genes, rendering an Ewing sarcoma RNA-binding protein-1.\n[26]\n\nMetastatases to the omentum, common in intraabdominal and pelvic malignancies, were thought to be via direct spread, given the anatomic proximity of the omentum to the tissue of origin. However, recent studies suggest that spread may also be hematogenous and that omental metastases are correlated with a tendency toward hematogenous spread.\n[5]",
    "monitoring": "The ability to accurately diagnose an omental tumor based on clinical and radiographic findings is limited. Usually, a definitive diagnosis can only be made through histopathological examination of the tumor.\n[28]\n[30]\nFor example, the appearance of a well-differentiated liposarcoma on computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is similar to fat and other abdominal tumors. In addition, the mass may be adherent to other organs, rendering the radiographic evaluation more difficult.\n[29]\n[30]\n\nContrast CT and MRI of the abdomen and pelvis are the best imaging methods for radiographic evaluation of omental tumors. CT often reveals a multilobular, flat, pancake-like mass with enhancing solid and multicystic densities. Angiography may demonstrate a feeding artery to the tumor arising from the omental blood supply. A highly vascular lesion is more likely to be malignant than a less vascular one. While ultrasound may visualize the tumor and delineate its internal structure, such findings are nonspecific.\n[29]\n[30]\n\nOmental SFTs appear as a proliferation of fibrous tissue within the omentum, possibly abutting surrounding structures. These tumors are well vascularized, and many have a cystic component with low attenuation, signifying necrosis and calcification. However, imaging modalities cannot usually differentiate between an SFT and other mesenchymal tumors.\n\nA lipomatous lesion is well-demarcated and homogenous or may have fibrous septations and calcification. Signs of malignancy include thicker septations, irregular shape, incursion into surrounding structures, and associated adenopathy. Positron emission tomography (PET) may help distinguish a lipoma from a well-differentiated liposarcoma.\n[20]\n\nA hemangiopericytoma often has nondistinct features on imaging. Color Doppler ultrasound may reveal significant vascularization with a vascular pedicle entering the tumor. CT may reveal a well-demarcated soft tissue mass common to many omental lesions. If benign, no calcifications or invasion are evident, but when malignant, necrosis and calcifications are evident. Angiography may be helpful to identify the vessels that feed the tumor.\n[10]\n\nThe desmoplastic small round cell tumor has radiographic features similar to other omental masses, including a hypoechoic heterogenous mass with enhanced vascularity, regions of necrosis, hemorrhage, and calcification. MRI can often identify CT-occult lesions, and PET is used for staging.\n[26]\n\nThe radiological features of an EGIST may be similar to omental leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma.\n[31]\nAn EGIST appears well-circumscribed on CT and can also feature areas of low attenuation from necrosis and hemorrhage. Of note is that EGIST does not have the central gas typically demonstrated by a GIST.\n[37]\n\nNeedle aspiration of omental tumors is not typically helpful due to inadequate tissue sampling. Apple et al reported accurate diagnosis could be achieved with fine needle aspiration by applying a careful and strict protocol, but the protocol requires standardization and replication in many patients. Histology, including immunohistochemistry, is often required for a definitive diagnosis, as is the case to distinguish mesothelioma from adenocarcinoma and sarcoma.\n[34]\n[42]\n\nVarious diagnostic modalities may be used to evaluate omental tumors. Image-guided percutaneous biopsy or laparoscopy is used to obtain tissue for diagnosis and staging. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) may be used to determine chromosomal translocation and is particularly useful when diagnosing a desmoplastic mall round cell tumor. Cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) may be elevated in some omental tumors, and while nonspecific, can be a prognostic indicator and aid in monitoring response to therapy.\n[26]\n[30]\n[34]\n[35]",
    "administration": "Please see the National Comprehensive Cancer Network for all available recently updated guidelines for treating cancer by type at\nnccn.org/guidelines\n.\n\nThe general approach to treating omental tumors is resection, including cytoreduction and debulking for advanced disease. Palliative surgery plus adjuvant chemoradiation has been shown to prolong survival in many cases. Most practices and treatment recommendations for primary omental tumors come from case studies and expert consensus.\n\nThe complete resection of omental liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma results in a good prognosis. Nonstandardized chemotherapy, in addition to radiation and immunotherapy, for nonresectable disease offers variable results. Relapse is a common problem following treatment for advanced disease, and long-term survival is low.\n[28]\n[29]\n\nApproximately 80% to 85% of omental SFTs are benign; malignant tumors can recur even several years after primary surgery.\n[34]\n[35]\nThe benefit of adjuvant therapy is unclear, but some reports suggest adjuvant radiotherapy may slow disease progression. Many malignant SFTs are c-kit positive, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors like imatinib and sunitinib, traditionally used when treating GISTs, have been employed to treat malignant omental SFTs.\n[32]\n[34]\n[35]\n[47]\nThe recommended treatment for omental GISTs is surgical resection with imatinib adjuvant therapy; this regimen has been shown to prevent relapse and prolong long-term survival.\n[31]\n[46]\n\nCytoreductive surgery in conjunction with intraoperative hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy has been adopted for the treatment of omental mesothelioma in small clinical trials and was shown to improve median survival. Vogelzang et al conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled phase III trial using pemetrexed-cisplatin for inoperable malignant pleural mesothelioma; this protocol has been applied to omental disease. Immunotherapy and radiotherapy are also used for omental mesothelioma.\n[42]\n[57]\n\nFor advanced-stage cancers that are commonly metastatic to the omentum, including uterine, gastric, ovarian, and colorectal malignancies, standard surgical care includes omentectomy. There is inconclusive evidence regarding the survival benefit of this practice. Still, expert consensus suggests that cytoreductive surgery improves overall and disease-free survival, and omentectomy provides staging and prognostic information. For example, omentectomy increased the detection of micrometastases in metastatic endometrial cancer, although the survival advantage was not significant. Given the increased chemoresistance to metastatic disease within the omentum, cytoreductive surgery remains the most effective therapy for metastases to this site.\n[5]\n[50]\n[58]\n[59]",
    "adverse_effects": "Intraabdominal rupture of an omental tumor has been described. Other complications arising from an omental tumor include torsion with infarction, hemorrhage, and obstruction.\n[35]"
