    "clinical_significance": "Maintaining a healthy, varied dietary pattern rich in whole, nutrient-dense foods in adequate quantities is imperative for maintaining health and preventing disease throughout the lifespan. The body needs micronutrients in small amounts to support biochemical processes and cellular function. To achieve the best outcomes, micronutrient needs should be primarily met through various whole foods, recurring to supplementation only when clinically necessary.\n[3]\n\nBoth deficient and excessive micronutrient consumption can have adverse health consequences and should be avoided. Vitamin A, folate, iodine, iron, and zinc are the most common micronutrient deficiencies worldwide and contribute to perinatal complications, poor growth, cognitive impairment, and increased morbidity and mortality.\n[1]\nIt must be noted that single micronutrient deficiencies are rare, and patients with malnutrition commonly present with multiple micronutrient deficiencies.\n[1]\n\nSupplementation is warranted in the setting of established deficiency as well as prevention in individuals at risk; however, fortification (adding vitamins and minerals to common foods) is also an effective strategy for prevention that has been shown to decrease the burden of micronutrient deficiencies at the population level.\n[1]\n\nBiofortification is often utilized to enhance the nutritional content of plant-based foods. This technique can combat widespread critical micronutrient shortages, such as zinc, iodine, iron, selenium, and carotenoids. Biofortification can be achieved through traditional plant breeding, genetic modifications, or certain farming practices.\n[53]\n\nVarious methods are classified under biofortification. One popular method is mineral fertilization, where mineral-rich fertilizers are used to improve the nutrient content of the soil, benefiting the plants growing in it.\n[54]\nAnother is foliar fertilization, which involves applying fertilizers directly to the plant's leaves.\n[55]\nResearch has shown that this method led to higher amounts of micronutrients like iron, zinc, and selenium in the grains when used on pulse crops.\n[56]\n\nIf the required nutrient variation does not exist naturally in a plant's gene pool, or if certain nutrients cannot be introduced through traditional breeding, then genetic engineering comes into play. This method has successfully enhanced the nutritional value of many crops.\n[57]\nA notable example is the creation of 'golden rice.' This genetically altered rice has been engineered to contain higher iron levels by producing an iron-storage protein known as ferritin.\n[58]\nAdditionally, it has been modified to produce β-carotene (a precursor to vitamin A) to help combat vitamin A deficiencies.\n[59]"
