    "indications": "Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) is a category of glaucoma characterized by chronic and progressive visual neuropathies that result in irreversible blindness.\n[1]\nThe classification pertains to childhood glaucoma cases, characterized by unique clinical features with an onset before 18 years of age. Genetic mutations leading to early-onset glaucoma are uncommon yet significant. Childhood glaucoma constitutes a notable category within early-onset glaucoma cases. Diagnosis is generally established through specific clinical criteria, including elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), optic nerve damage, corneal alterations, or visual field defects indicative of optic neuropathy.\n\nPCG involves impairment of the normal drainage of aqueous fluid in the eye, predominantly arising from developmental abnormalities in the trabecular meshwork and anterior chamber angle, resulting in elevated IOP. This untreated pressure damages the optic nerve, resulting in subsequent vision loss. The disease's natural history frequently advances swiftly in the absence of intervention, exhibiting a marked tendency for bilateral involvement. Therefore, timely diagnosis and intervention are crucial for maintaining vision.\n\nThe trabecular meshwork of the eye is essential for regulating aqueous humor outflow. This route is either aberrant or obstructed in PCG, resulting in increased IOP.\n[2]\nThe anterior chamber angle, comprising features such as the Schlemm canal and trabecular meshwork, is essential for proper fluid drainage. Irregularities in these structures in patients with PCG obstruct the correct passage of aqueous humor from the eye, leading to increased IOP, which damages the optic nerve and the retinal nerve fiber layer.\n[3]\nComprehending the anatomical foundation of PCG is essential for clinical assessment and surgical intervention.\n\nHippocrates first described PCG when he noted abnormally enlarged eyes in infants. The pathogenesis of increased IOP and angle abnormalities were later correlated with this entity. PCG is also referred to as developmental glaucoma, as it might not always be present at birth. Subtypes of PCG correlate with the age of onset of the disease.\n[4]\nThese subtypes are:\n\nTrue congenital glaucoma\n: Also known as newborn glaucoma, this subtype accounts for approximately 25% of cases of PCG. In true congenital glaucoma, the child is either born with ocular enlargement or enlargement of the eyes is noticed within the 1st month of life. The elevation IOP likely occurs during fetal life.\n[5]\n\nInfantile glaucoma\n: This subtype of PCG includes patients who manifest symptoms between ages 1 and 36 months and accounts for approximately 65% of patients with PCG.\n[6]\n\nJuvenile glaucoma\n: This subtype accounts for approximately 10% of cases of PCG and includes patients with signs of elevated IOP that manifest between 3 years and adulthood.\n[7]\n\nThe Hoskin classification is another classification system for PCG.\n[8]\nThis system is based on the area of dysgenesis and comprises 3 types. Hoskin type I is referred to as PCG; types II and III are considered secondary congenital glaucoma.\n\nType I, Trabeculodysgenesis\n: The defect lies in the development of trabecular meshwork.\n\nType II, Iridotrabeculodysgenesis\n: This includes hypoplasia or hyperplasia of the stroma, anomalous iris vessels, or structural defects in the form of coloboma or aniridia.\n\nType III, Corneotrabeculodysgenesis\n:\nThis includes complex cases of congenital glaucoma like Axenfield, Rieger, or Peters anomaly.\n[8]\n\nIn conjunction with prominent ophthalmological organizations, the Childhood Glaucoma Research Network (CGRN) has established a consensus-driven classification system for childhood glaucoma.\n[9]\nThis method classifies childhood glaucoma into primary and secondary glaucoma. Primary pediatric glaucoma encompasses PCG and juvenile open-angle glaucoma (JOAG). PCG, the predominant nonsyndromic variant in infancy, can be further categorized by the age of onset into neonatal or newborn onset (within 1 month of age), infantile (1 month to 2 years of age), or late-onset (older than 2 years of age) classifications.\n\nPCG usually manifests in neonates or infants with symptoms such as buphthalmos (enlarged eyes) and Haab striae (corneal striae).\n[10]\nIn contrast, JOAG is typically asymptomatic and frequently identified in older children or discovered incidentally during family screenings.\n[7]\nConversely, secondary childhood glaucoma arises from nonacquired ocular defects, nonacquired systemic disorders, acquired conditions, or complications following cataract surgery. This classification facilitates the differentiation of glaucoma subtypes and guides treatment methods, acknowledging the impact of hereditary factors and systemic circumstances on disease progression.",
    "mechanism": "Most cases of PCG are sporadic without a family history of the disease. The significant risk factors for PCG are consanguineous marriage, genetic predisposition, and first-degree relatives (including siblings) with the disease. Approximately 90% of cases belong to this category. PCG tends to be caused by genetic variants that follow a Mendelian inheritance pattern.\n[11]\nAnother 10% of cases are familial, showing an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern with incomplete penetrance ranging from 40% to 100%. Mutations in the\nCYP1B1\n(cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily B member 1) gene are the predominant genetic anomalies linked to PCG.\n[12]\nThis gene is essential for the formation of the trabecular meshwork and the anterior portion of the eye. Additional implicated genes, including\nLTBP2\n(latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 2), are located next to the\nGLC3C\nlocus.\n[13]\n[14]\nThese genetic abnormalities cause a dysfunctional trabecular meshwork, obstructing proper drainage of aqueous fluid and increasing IOP. Several gene loci have been linked to PCG, which includes\nGLC3A\n,\nGLC3B\n,\nGLC3C\n,\nGLC3D\n, and\nGLC3E\n. Locus\nGLC3A\nhas been linked to the\nCYP1B1\ngene.\n[15]\n\nMutations in this gene are most commonly responsible for autosomal recessively inherited cases.\n[16]\nA recent systematic review reported that\nCYP1B1\nwas the most common gene mutation reported in the current literature and that the other gene variants related to childhood glaucoma included\nMYOC\n(myocilin),\nLTBP2\n,\nFOXC1\n(forkhead box C1),\nPITX2\n(paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2),\nANGPT1\n(angiopoietin 1) and\nTEK\n(or receptor tyrosine kinase).\n[17]",
    "monitoring": "The diagnosis of PCG necessitates a thorough and precise ophthalmologic assessment. Timely detection is essential for averting irreparable harm to ocular tissues and maintaining eyesight in children. Any suspicion of congenital glaucoma warrants a thorough and precise evaluation under anesthesia for detailed examination and planning of further management.\n[40]\nThis evaluation should include an assessment of the following structures and performance of the following studies.\n\nCornea\n: Corneal evaluation, namely for buphthalmos, corneal opacification, and Haab striae, is an essential diagnostic element.\n[41]\nThe most common cause of buphthalmos is PCG or primary infantile glaucoma. Corneal clouding typically arises from epithelial edema due to increased IOP. In considerable edema, the slit-lamp examination may reveal posterior stromal involvement, signifying prolonged increased IOP. Assessing the horizontal corneal diameter is an essential component of PCG evaluation. The typical ocular diameter in neonates ranges from 9.5 to 10.5 mm, with an expansion >12 mm strongly indicative of PCG. Detailed corneal evaluation should be performed along with measuring corneal diameter with the help of calipers. In addition, a hand-held slit lamp can be used to evaluate the cornea and anterior segment details.\n\nOphthalmoscopy\n: The evaluation of the optic nerve is essential for determining the degree of glaucomatous impairment.\n[42]\nFundoscopy under anesthesia is frequently necessary in pediatric patients. The optic disc may exhibit reversible cupping in the initial phases of primary open-angle glaucoma.\n[43]\nHowever, if the condition advances untreated, the optic cup-to-disc ratio increases, potentially leading to irreversible optic nerve atrophy. Precise documentation of the optic nerve's appearance, preferably with images, is essential for monitoring disease development. Common alterations in the optic disc encompass increased cupping, pallor, and loss of the nerve fiber layer. Any abnormal vessels or other significant findings should be well documented.\n\nIntraocular pressure\n: Measuring IOP is fundamental to diagnosing glaucoma.\n[39]\nSpecialized handheld instruments like the Perkins application, Schiotz tonometer, or Tonopen are frequently utilized in neonates.\n[44]\nThe Schiotz tonometer, which assesses IOP by indentation principles, is similarly applicable but is less preferred due to its relative inaccuracy relative to applanation techniques. In healthy infants, IOP typically ranges from 10 to 20 mm Hg; in PCG, values can markedly surpass 30 to 40 mm Hg, signifying a substantially impaired aqueous humor outflow and increasing the risk of corneal epithelial edema. The effect of the chosen anesthetic agent on IOP should be kept in mind.\n\nGonioscopy\n: This is a crucial diagnostic procedure used to assess the anterior chamber angle and verify the existence of trabeculodysgenesis.\n[45]\nThe angle in PCG is frequently atypical, characterized by elevated iris insertion, a flattened or concave iris root, and an underdeveloped trabecular meshwork. This assessment necessitates the utilization of a Koeppe lens or Zeiss gonioprism and is generally conducted under anesthesia in younger children due to inadequate compliance. Gonioscopic findings are essential for distinguishing PCG from other forms of childhood glaucoma or anterior segment dysgenesis syndromes.\n[35]\n\nPachymetry\n: Corneal thickness measurements can be increased in PCG due to corneal edema. Increased IOP causes stromal edema, resulting in a thicker than normal cornea. Pachymetry measurements might yield significant information, as a thicker cornea may result in inaccurately overestimated IOP readings. Monitoring corneal thickness is crucial throughout the postsurgical follow-up to evaluate edema resolution and better assess IOP measurements.\n\nAxial length\n: Ultrasound biometry can be used to ascertain the eye's axial length.\n[46]\nThe axial length in neonates measures roughly 16 to 18 mm, growing to about 22 mm by age 2. In PCG, increased IOP results in axial elongation, which is associated with the increased severity and duration of pressure. Axial lengths greater than 20 mm at birth or during early infancy strongly indicate congenital glaucoma. Monitoring axial length is essential since excessive elongation may lead to axial myopia and additional visual deterioration.\n\nCycloplegic retinoscopy\n: This procedure is essential for identifying refractive defects, especially myopia and astigmatism, prevalent in PCG due to axial elongation and corneal alterations.\n[47]\nCycloplegic refraction aids in identifying anisometropia, a notable risk factor for the onset of amblyopia. An increased axial length might lead to axial myopia.\n\nPerimetry can be tried to assess peripheral visual field loss in children older than 7 or 8 years who have reasonably good visual acuity, good fixation, and no nystagmus.\n[48]\nThe SITA-FAST algorithm is preferred in these children. When the child becomes cooperative and eligible for slit lamp examination, optical coherence tomography can be attempted in these children to evaluate the retinal nerve and ganglion cell layer.\n[49]\nHandheld and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography\n[50]\nare upcoming modalities for assessing the anterior segment, retinal nerve fiber, and ganglion cell layer while evaluating anesthesia. Genetic screening, analysis, and pedigree chart evaluation can be considered in these cases.\n[51]",
    "administration": "The management of PCG depends on the age and the severity of the disease at the time of diagnosis. The primary objective of treatment is to lower IOP and maintain optic nerve functionality; increased IOP may result in irreversible vision impairment if not addressed swiftly. Though the mainstay of treatment is surgical intervention, initial medical management may be required as dictated by the clinical presentation.\n[52]\n\nThe preferred treatment for PCG is angle surgery, either goniotomy or trabeculotomy, to alleviate IOP by enhancing aqueous outflow.\n[53]\nWhen angle surgery fails, trabeculectomy with mitomycin C or placement of a device such as the Ahmed\n®\nglaucoma valve or Baerveldt\n®\nglaucoma drainage device should be attempted.\n[54]\nIn recalcitrant cases, cycloablation can be attempted using diode cyclophotocaogulation, Nd:YAG therapy, or cryoablation. Topical or oral antiglaucoma drugs are used for decreasing corneal edema, controlling IOP, and improving visualization when performing goniotomy.\n\nMedical Treatment\n\nThis approach is often an initial treatment measure to lower the IOP to decrease corneal edema and improve angle visualization until any surgical procedure is planned or surgical clearance is obtained. Treatment with topical medications decreases aqueous production or increases the aqueous outflow.\n[55]\nMedications that decrease aqueous humor production include alpha-adrenergic agonists like brimonidine and apraclonidine, beta blockers like timolol, betaxolol, and levobetaxolol, or carbonic anhydrase inhibitors like brinzolamide. Certain aspects of topical therapy in newborns and children that should be considered include:\n\nBeta blockers\n: Beta blockers (eg, timolol, betaxolol) diminish aqueous humor production but should be used cautiously in newborns due to the potential for systemic adverse effects, including bronchospasm and bradycardia.\nCarbonic anhydrase inhibitors\n: Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (eg, brinzolamide and acetazolamide) are utilized to reduce aqueous humor production. This class of topical drops is preferred due to their efficacy and safety.\nProstaglandin analogs\n: Prostaglandin analogs (eg, latanoprost, travoprost) enhance uveoscleral outflow; nonetheless, their effectiveness in PCG is inconsistent, and they are generally not considered first-line treatments for newborns.\nBrimonidine\n: This alpha-adrenergic agonist is contraindicated for children younger than 2 years of age because of the potential for central nervous system depression. Brimonidine needs to be used with caution in children younger than 6 years, as it can cross the blood-brain barrier and may cause respiratory depression, apnea, and drowsiness.\n[56]\nPilocarpine:\nPilocarpine 1% or 2% can be used 2 to 3 times daily and is usually applied preoperatively to improve angle visualization during surgery. Occasionally, pilocarpine is administered postoperatively for a few weeks.\n\nSurgical Treatment\n\nSurgery is the mainstay of treatment for patients with PCG. The type of surgical procedure depends on the disease severity, cornea clarity, and surgeon's choice and experience. Surgical procedures for PCG can be broadly divided into the following:\n\nAngle procedures\n\nThese procedures increase the aqueous outflow by decreasing the resistance in the aqueous pathway due to angle anomaly. The angle procedures are either of 2 types based on the following internal or external approaches:\n\nInternal approach\n: Barkan initially described an internal approach using goniotomy.\n[57]\nIn this technique, a Barkan knife is passed through the limbus into the angle approximately between the root of the iris and Schwalbe ring under a gonioscopic view, which is then extended through 75 degrees. The prerequisite for this procedure is a relatively clear cornea, which enables clear visualization of angle structures. Success rates depend on cornea clarity, the severity of the disease, and the number of lobotomies performed. Studies have reported variable success rates from 70% to 90%.\n[58]\n\nExternal approach\n: Smith first described an external approach using trabeculectomy.\n[59]\nThis is useful in cases of a hazy cornea due to corneal clouding or where goniotomy procedures have failed. This technique makes a conjunctival flap, followed by a partial thickness scleral flap. A scleral incision is made, and the Schlemm canal is exposed. The lower prong of a Harm trabeculotome is passed along the Schlemm canal on the inner side, and the upper prong visible outside serves as a guide. The trabeculotome is then rotated towards the anterior chamber to break the inner wall of the canal. A similar procedure is repeated on the other side through the 12 o'clock opening, thus opening 120 to 180 degrees of the trabeculum. A new modification using a prolene suture has been described as a modification procedure. This allows 360-degree trabeculotomy and the entire angle to be opened in a single sitting.\n[60]\nThe studies have reported a reduction in IOP by 75% to 90% following trabeculotomy.\n[61]\n\nFiltration procedures\n\nThe following filtration procedures may be utilized:\n\nTrabeculectomy\n: This was first described by Cairns.\n[62]\nIsolated trabeculectomy procedures are not often performed in PCG due to limited success rates and exaggerated healing responses experienced in children. Antifibrotic agents like mitomycin-C and 5-fluorouracil have shown promising results in improving success rates. Success rates from 52% to 82% have been reported following antimetabolite-assisted trabeculectomy procedures in PCG patients.\n[63]\n\nDeep sclerectomy\n: This procedure involves elevating a partial-thickness scleral flap and removing the external portion of the Schlemm canal and outer part of the trabecular meshwork, including juxtacanalicular tissue, without fully penetrating the eye, thus less risk of hypotony and endophthalmitis.\n[64]\n\nGlaucoma drainage devices (GDD)\n: The role of GDD in PCG as a primary procedure is limited. GDD implantation in PCG is considered in cases where primary angle procedures have failed or in advanced refractory cases. Studies have shown a reduction of IOP by 28% to 49% following 1-year postsurgery.\n[65]\nThese devices establish an artificial drainage pathway for the aqueous humor, redirecting it from the anterior chamber to an external reservoir (see\nImage\n. Glaucoma Drainage Device). Although GDDs effectively reduce IOP, they are linked to problems including tube migration, erosion, and infection.\n\nCombined trabeculotomy and trabeculectomy\n\nThis procedure is attempted when the previous trabeculectomy has failed or cannulating the Schlemm canal is difficult.\n[66]\nIn this, the trabeculectomy is added to the trabeculectomy.\n[67]\nA block of tissue is removed from the sclera aided by surgical peripheral iridectomy. Care is necessary when using mitomycin C.\n\nCyclodestructive procedures\n\nThis procedure is reserved for eyes with poor or nil visual prognosis. These approaches selectively abrogate the ciliary body to diminish aqueous fluid generation. Due to their aggressive character and the associated risks of consequences, including hypotony or retinal detachment, they are typically designated for advanced or refractory cases. The success rate in these cases is close to 30% only.\n[68]\nA newer modification in the form of a micropulse transscleral diode laser is a better and safer alternative.\n[69]",
    "adverse_effects": "Complications in PCG can be related to disease, surgery, or anesthesia. Patients having delayed presentations may develop significant visual impairment, glaucomatous optic atrophy, or visual field defects. Corneal and Haab striae development may later lead to permanent opacification of the cornea, thus significantly hampering vision. Stretching the eyeball due to elevated pressures may lead to axial myopia or astigmatism. Refractive correction should be provided with lifelong follow-up, as untreated cases can develop refractive amblyopia.\n[81]\nFurther, these patients are at risk of lens dislocation or retinal complications.\n\nSurgical Complications\n\nSurgical complications include:\n\nHyphema\nShallow anterior chamber\n[82]\nPeripheral anterior synechiae\nIridodialysis\nCyclodialysis\n[83]\nCataract\n[84]\n[85]\nEpithelial ingrowth\nChoroidal detachment\nRetinal detachment\nPhthisis bulbi\n\nFiltering Procedure-Related Complications\n\nAdverse effects of filtering procedures include:\n\nOver or under-filtration\nBlebitis\nVitreous loss\nScleral collapse\nScleral flap leak\nTube lens touch\nEndothelial decompensation from tube cornea touch\nTube erosion\nImplant migration\nDiplopia from implant-related restrictions\nEndophthalmitis\n\nCyclodestructive Procedure-Related Complications\n\nComplications associated with cyclodestructive procedures include:\n\nHypotony\nRetinal detachment\n[86]\nPhthisis\n\nAnesthesia-Related Complications\n\nComplications associated with anesthesia include:\n\nOculocardiac reflex\nAnaphylaxis\nMalignant hyperthermia\nCardiovascular collapse\nHepatic porphyria\nHypoxic brain injury"
