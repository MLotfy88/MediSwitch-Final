The possibility of prolonged and/or increased pharmacologic effects of venlafaxine should be considered. Although venlafaxine is primarily metabolized by CYP450 2D6, there is some evidence that CYP450 3A4 may play a minor role, thus any alteration in its activity levels could conceivably affect the metabolism of venlafaxine. The interaction may be of greater concern in patients who are CYP450 2D6-deficient, or so-called poor metabolizers of CYP450 2D6 (approximately 7% of Caucasians and less than 2% of Asians and individuals of African descent).', NULL, 'Caution is recommended when venlafaxine is used with CYP450 3A4 inhibitors.', NULL, 'Caution is recommended when venlafaxine is used with CYP450 3A4 inhibitors.', 'Metabolism', 'Phenelzine, Duloxetine, Desipramine, Tranylcypromine, Trimipramine, Desvenlafaxine, Maprotiline, Fluoxetine, St. John''s Wort, Isocarboxazid, Oxitriptan, More', 'Caspofungin, Micafungin, Amphotericin B, Oteseconazole, Flucytosine, Anidulafungin', 'Moderate', NULL, 'DDInter', 'pharmacodynamic', NULL, 'https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/121211/', '[1] "Product Information.
