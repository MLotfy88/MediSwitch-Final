', '**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].



Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].



In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].



There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].



Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].



The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. 



In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].



In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].



The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].', 'Zinc is involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of human proteins may bind zinc, in addition to hundreds of proteins that transport and traffic zinc. It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is an essential element for a proper sense of taste and smell and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations [L2211].



Studies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions [L2095]:



**Colds:** Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently [L2095].



**Wound healing:** Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements [L2095]. 



**Diahrrea**: Oral zinc supplements can reduce the symptoms of diarrhea in children with low levels of zinc, especially in cases of malnutrition [L2095].

Migraine attacks are generally divided into phases: the premonitory phase, which typically involves irritability, fatigue, yawning, and stiff neck; the headache phase, which lasts for between four and 72 hours; and the postdrome phase, which lasts for up to a day following resolution of pain and whose symptoms are similar to those of the premonitory phase. In addition, neurological deficits, collectively termed migraine aura, may precede the headache phase.[A193797, A193794]



The underlying pathophysiology of migraines is a matter of active research but involves both neurological and vascular components. The head pain associated with migraine is thought to be a consequence of activation of the nociceptive nerves comprising the trigeminocervical complex (TCC).[A193794] Terminals of nociceptive nerves that innervate the dura matter release vasoactive peptides, such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), resulting in cranial vasodilation. Finally, when present, migraine aura appears to correlate with a transient wave(s) of cortical depolarization, termed cortical spreading depression (CSD).[A193794,A193851]



Triptans, including zolmitriptan, are proposed to act in three ways. The main mechanism is through modulation of nociceptive nerve signalling in the central nervous system through 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> receptors throughout the TCC and associated areas of the brain. In addition, triptans can enhance vasoconstriction, both through direct 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>-mediated dilation of cranial blood vessels,[A462, A198741] as well as through 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>-mediated suppression of CGRP release.[A193794, L12978]

', '**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].



Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].



In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].



There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].



Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].



The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. 



In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].



In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].



The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].', 'Zinc is involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of human proteins may bind zinc, in addition to hundreds of proteins that transport and traffic zinc. It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is an essential element for a proper sense of taste and smell and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations [L2211].



Studies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions [L2095]:



**Colds:** Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently [L2095].



**Wound healing:** Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements [L2095]. 



**Diahrrea**: Oral zinc supplements can reduce the symptoms of diarrhea in children with low levels of zinc, especially in cases of malnutrition [L2095].

The retention of phosphate plays a pivotal role in causing secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with osteodystrophy, and soft-tissue calcification. The mechanism by which phosphate retention leads to hyperparathyroidism is not clearly delineated. Therapeutic efforts directed toward the control of hyperphosphatemia include reduction in the dietary intake of phosphate, inhibition of absorption of phosphate in the intestine with phosphate binders, and removal of phosphate from the body by more efficient methods of dialysis. The rate of removal of phosphate by dietary manipulation or by dialysis is insufficient. Dialysis patients absorb 40% to 80% of dietary phosphorus. Therefore, the fraction of dietary phosphate absorbed from the diet needs to be reduced by using phosphate binders in most renal failure patients on maintenance dialysis. Calcium acetate when taken with meals combines with dietary phosphate to form insoluble calcium phosphate which is excreted in the feces. Maintenance of serum phosphorus below 6.0 mg/dl is generally considered as a clinically acceptable outcome of treatment with phosphate binders.

Cineol containing preparations of eucalyptus oil may contain up to 80% (or more) 1,8-cineole [A32243] and is one of the most common types of eucalyptus oil formulations used. As an active agent indicated for relieving certain cold symptoms and/or certain muscular sprains and cramps, it is believed that eucalyptus oil may possess some antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities.



Some in vitro studies of human blood monocytes suggest a dose-dependent effect of eucalyptus oil to elicit significant inhibition of multiple cytokines, perhaps in the treatment of airway inflammation [A32244, A32245]. Moreover, other studies in animal models discuss the possibility of eucalyptus oil demonstrating anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects that potentially account for inhibiting the formation of prostaglandins and cytokines by stimulated monocytes in vitro [A32246, A32247].



Furthermore, additional studies have observed eucalyptus oil anti-viral activity against herpes simplex virus (HSV-1, HSV-2) in cell cultures as well as the demonstration of broad antimicrobial activity of eucalyptus medicinal plant extracts against Alicyclobacillus acidoterretris, Bacillus cereus, E. coli, Enterococcus faecalis, MRSA, Propionibacterium acnes, S. aureus, fungus including C. albicans isolates, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and other Gram-positive bacteria. Specific activity against periodontopathic bacteria, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sobrinus has also been observed [A32250, A32251, A32252, A32253, A32254].', 'Lipophilic monoterpene formulations of eucalyptus oil appear to be readily absorbed orally, with a primarily oxidative metabolism that might necessitate induction of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system and subsequent urinary excretion [A32236]. Gastrointestinal absorption of eucalyptus appears to be rapid and may be enhanced by the intake of lipids and milk. 1,8-cineole (which makes up to as much as 90% of most commonly used cineole-based eucalyptus oils) [A32227] has also been found in vitro and in animals to possess cytochrome P450 inducing activity [A32237, A32238, A32239].', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Clove oil is thought to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, thereby reducing painful symptoms [A33145].



Eugenol, the main constituent of clove oil is purported to have anticancer action. In one study, eugenol-treated HL-60 cells showed features of apoptosis including DNA fragmentation and formation of DNA ladders in agarose gel electrophoresis. It was observed that eugenol transduced the apoptotic signal via reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, inducing mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), decreasing anti-apoptotic protein _bcl-2_ level, inducing _cytochrome c_ release to the cytosol, and subsequent apoptotic cell death. When taken together, the study showed that ROS plays a critical role in eugenol-induced apoptosis in _HL-60_, and this is the first report on the mechanism of the anticancer effect of eugenol [A33146].', 'Clove (Eugenia caryophyllata Thunb. [Myrtaceae]) essential oil (CEO) has been demonstrated to possess antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-histamine, and anticancer properties. However, few studies have focused on its topical use [A33133], [L2850].



Clove essential oil, used as an antiseptic in oral infections, inhibits gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria as well as yeast [A24841].

**Topical**



Indicated for the treatment of persistent (non-transient) facial erythema of rosacea in adults 18 years of age or older.[L6535]', 'In the eye, alpha-1 adrenoceptors play a role in vasoconstriction, mydriasis, eyelid retraction, and elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) whereas alpha-2 adrenoceptors are responsible for IOP reduction via a complex Gi-coupled signaling cascade pathway. Activation of alpha-2 receptors leads to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and reduction of cyclic AMP levels. As a result, there is a decrease in norpinephrine (NE) release at the synaptic junction, NE-induced stimulation of beta-2 adrenoceptors, and production of aqueous humor by the ciliary epithelium.[A178969] An elevated IOP is the most significant risk factor for developing glaucomatous optic neuropathy, which is associated with progressive visual field loss and functional disability if left untreated.[A179002] Regardless of the etiology of the disease, the aim of current therapies for glaucoma is to reduce IOP, as reduction of IOP significantly reduces the risk of progression of vision loss even when IOP is already within the normal range.[A36674] When administered ophthalmically, brimonidine is rapidly absorbed into the eye, acts as an agonist at ocular alpha-2 adrenoceptors and lowers IOP via a dual mechanism of action.[A178981] It is proposed that initial dosing of the drug causes a reduction in aqueous humour production and chronic dosing leads to an increase in uveoscleral outflow.[A179002] Brimonidine does not affect episcleral venous pressure.[A178969] By reducing IOP, brimonidine aims to reduce the likelihood of glaucomatous visual field loss in ocular hypertension, and slow the progression of visual field defect in established open-angle glaucoma.[A178951] When applied topically on skin, brimonidine reduces erythema through direct vasocontriction of small arteries and veins.[A178978] As brimonidine mediates a potent peripheral vasoconstrictive activity by selectively working on the alpha-2 adrenoceptors, the use of brimonidine is thought to be efficacious for the treatment of facial erythema of rosacea, which is thought to arise from vasomotor instability and abnormal vasodilation of the superficial cutaneous vasculature of the face.[A178984]', 'Brimonidine is a highly selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist that is 1000-fold more selective for the alpha2-adrenergic receptor than the alpha1-adrenergic receptor.[L6544] This characteristic gives the drug some therapeutic advantages, since it reduces the risk of systemic side effects, such as systemic hypotension, bradycardia, and sedation. In addition, there is a reduction in the risk for developing alpha-1 mediated ocular unwanted effects, such as conjunctival blanching, mydriasis, and eyelid retraction.[A179002] However, despite high alpha-2 receptor specificity, brimonidine may still produce alpha-1 adrenoceptor-mediated ocular effects, such as conjunctival vasoconstriction.[A178969] Brimonidine has a peak ocular hypotensive effect occurring at two hours post-dosing.[label] In a randomized, double-blind clinical study, ocular administration of 0.2% brimonidine in healthy volunteers resulted in a 23% reduction of mean intraocular pressure from baseline at 3 hours following administration.[A178951] In comparative studies consisting of patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, the ocular hypotensive effect of brimonidine was maintained during treatment periods of up to 1 year.[A178945] 



Brimonidine mediates vasoconstrictive effects and it was shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory properties in _ex vivo_ human skin model and _in vivo_ inflammation models.[A179041] In a clinial trials consisting of adults with moderate to severe facial erythema of rosacea, brimonidine was shown to improve the extent of redness at 3 hours after application, compared to placebo.[L6544] It was shown to be a potent vasoconstrictor of human subcutaneous vessels with a diameter of less than 200 µm. In _in vivo_ mouse inflammation models, brimonidine displayed anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting edema.[A178978] In a randomized, double-blind study, brimonidine reduced erythema for the 12 hours of the study in a dose-dependent manner.[A178978]



When adminsitered systemically, brimonidine was shown to cause cardiovascular effects by decreasing blood pressure, decreasing heart and respiratory rate, and prolonging the PR interval in the electrocardiogram. This is due to the targeting of adrenoceptors by the drug.[A178963,A178966] Although the clinical significance has not been established, there is evidence that brimonidine exhibits neuroprotective activity in experimental models of cerebral ischemia and optic nerve injury.[A178969] _In vitro_ studies show that brimonidine mediated protective effects on neuronal cells from kainate acid insult and on cultured retinal ganglion cells from glutamate-induced cytotoxicity, which is a possible mediator of secondary neuronal degeneration in human glaucoma. Neuroprotective actions of brimonidine were also demonstrated in rat models of acute retinal ischemia and chronic IOP elevation. It has been proposed that brimonidine may exert neuroprotective effects on the retina and optic nerve by enhancing intrinsic retinal ganglion cell survival mechanisms and/or induction of neuronal survival factors, such as bFGF.[A178951] However, further investigations are needed to conclude on these possible therapeutic benefits of the drug.', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

It may be also be used to treat acute pain from various sources, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in children over 2, ankylosing spondylitis, and primary dysmenorrhea.[L7646]



Celecoxib, in combination with [tramadol], is indicated for the management of acute pain in adults severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and in whom alternative treatments are inadequate.[L38949]', 'Unlike most NSAIDs, which inhibit both types of cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2), celecoxib is a selective noncompetitive inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme. COX-2 is expressed heavily in inflamed tissues where it is induced by inflammatory mediators.[L7646] The inhibition of this enzyme reduces the synthesis of metabolites that include prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), prostacyclin (PGI2), thromboxane (TXA2), prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), and prostaglandin F2 (PGF2). Resultant inhibition of these mediators leads to the alleviation of pain and inflammation.[A34124,L7646] 



By inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cause mucosal damage, ulceration and ulcer complication throughout the gastrointestinal tract.[L7646] Celecoxib poses less of an ulceration risk than other NSAIDS, owing to its decreased effect on gastric mucosal prostaglandin synthesis when compared to placebo.[A34152] 



Celecoxib exerts anticancer effects by binding to the cadherin-11 (CDH11)protein,  which is thought to be involved in the progression of tumors, and inhibiting the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1) signaling mechanism.[T647,A11861] In addition, celecoxib has been found to inhibit carbonic anhydrase enzymes 2 and 3, further enhancing its anticancer effects.[A28426,A20066]



As mentioned in the pharmacodynamics section of this drug entry, celecoxib may cause an increased risk of thrombotic events. The risk of thrombosis resulting from COX-2 inhibition is caused by the vasoconstricting actions of thromboxane A2, leading to enhanced platelet aggregation, which is uncontrolled when the actions of prostacyclin, a platelet aggregation inhibitor, are suppressed through the inhibition of COX-2.[L7622]', '

Celecoxib inhibits cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) enzyme, reducing pain and inflammation. It is important to note that though the risk of bleeding with celecoxib is lower than with certain other NSAIDS, it exists nonetheless and caution must be observed when it is administered to those with a high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.[L7607]



**A note on the risk of cardiovascular events**



Significant concerns regarding the safety of COX-2 selective NSAIDs emerged in the early 2000s. [Rofecoxib], another member of the COX-2 inhibitor drug class, also known as Vioxx, was withdrawn from the market due to prothrombotic cardiovascular risks.[L7622] Following an FDA Advisory Committee meeting in 2005, in which data from large clinical outcome trials were evaluated, the FDA concluded that the risk for cardiovascular thrombotic events for both COX-2 selective NSAIDs and nonselective NSAIDs was evident.[L3293] It was determined that the benefits of celecoxib treatment, however, outweighed the risks.[L7622] Postmarketing cardiovascular outcomes trial (PRECISION) revealed that the lowest possible dose of celecoxib was similar in cardiovascular safety to moderate strength doses of both naproxen and ibuprofen. Patients who had previous cardiovascular events including acute MI, coronary revascularization, or coronary stent insertion were not evaluated in the trial. It is not advisable to administer NSAIDS to these groups of patients.[L3293]

The Health Canada monograph for rosuvastatin further specifies that rosuvastatin is indicated for the reduction of elevated total cholesterol (Total-C), LDL-C, ApoB, the Total-C/HDL-C ratio and triglycerides (TG) and for increasing HDL-C in hyperlipidemic and dyslipidemic conditions when response to diet and exercise alone has been inadequate. It is also indicated for the prevention of major cardiovascular events (including risk of myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and coronary artery revascularization) in adult patients without documented history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events, but with at least two conventional risk factors for cardiovascular disease.[F4652]



Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]', 'Rosuvastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A181421] Rosuvastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which increases hepatic uptake of LDL. Rosuvastatin also inhibits hepatic synthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL).[F4649] The overall effect is a decrease in plasma LDL and VLDL. 



In vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that rosuvastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] This includes improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response.



Statins have also been found to bind allosterically to β2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and in T cell activation.[A181559]



Rosuvastatin exerts an anti-inflammatory effect on rat mesenteric microvascular endothelium by attenuating leukocyte rolling, adherence and transmigration.[A1807] The drug also modulates nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression and reduces ischemic-reperfusion injuries in rat hearts.[A1787] Rosuvastatin increases the bioavailability of nitric oxide[A1807,A1799,A1787] by upregulating NOS[A1791] and by increasing the stability of NOS through post-transcriptional polyadenylation.[A1796] It is unclear as to how rosuvastatin brings about these effects though they may be due to decreased concentrations of mevalonic acid.', 'Rosuvastatin is a synthetic, enantiomerically pure antilipemic agent. It is used to lower total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and trigleride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, rosuvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A181087, A181406]



Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]



**Skeletal Muscle Effects**



Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. These risks can occur at any dose level, but are increased at the highest dose (40 mg). Rosuvastatin should be prescribed with caution in patients with predisposing factors for myopathy (e.g., age ≥ 65 years, inadequately treated hypothyroidism, renal impairment).



The risk of myopathy during treatment with rosuvastatin may be increased with concurrent administration of some other lipid-lowering therapies (such as [fenofibrate] or [niacin]), [gemfibrozil], [cyclosporine], [atazanavir]/[ritonavir], [lopinavir]/ritonavir, or [simeprevir].  Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin, coadministered with [colchicine], and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together.[F4649] 



Real-world data from observational studies has suggested that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]



**Liver Enzyme Abnormalities**



Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. In most cases, the elevations were transient and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. There were two cases of jaundice, for which a relationship to rosuvastatin therapy could not be determined, which resolved after discontinuation of therapy. There were no cases of liver failure or irreversible liver disease in these trials.[F4649]



**Endocrine Effects**



Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin calcium tablets. Based on clinical trial data with rosuvastatin, in some instances these increases may exceed the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.[F4649]



An in vitro study found that [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], and [pitavastatin] exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on human pancreas islet β cells, with reductions in cell viability of 32, 41, 34 and 29%, respectively, versus control]. Moreover, insulin secretion rates were decreased by 34, 30, 27 and 19%, respectively, relative to control.[A182012]



HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and lower cholesterol levels and, as such, might theoretically blunt adrenal or gonadal steroid hormone production. Rosuvastatin demonstrated no effect upon nonstimulated cortisol levels and no effect on thyroid metabolism as assessed by TSH plasma concentration. In rosuvastatin treated patients, there was no impairment of adrenocortical reserve and no reduction in plasma cortisol concentrations. Clinical studies with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have suggested that these agents do not reduce plasma testosterone concentration. The effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on male fertility have not been studied. The effects, if any, on the pituitarygonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown.[F4652]



**Cardiovascular**



Ubiquinone levels were not measured in rosuvastatin clinical trials, however significant decreases in circulating ubiquinone levels in patients treated with other statins have been observed. The clinical significance of a potential long-term statin-induced deficiency of ubiquinone has not been established. It has been reported that a decrease in myocardial ubiquinone levels could lead to impaired cardiac function in patients with borderline congestive heart failure.[F4652]



**Lipoprotein A**



In some patients, the beneficial effect of lowered total cholesterol and LDL-C levels may be partly blunted by a concomitant increase in the Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentrations. Present knowledge suggests the importance of high Lp(a) levels as an emerging risk factor for coronary heart disease. It is thus desirable to maintain and reinforce lifestyle changes in high-risk patients placed on rosuvastatin therapy.[F4652] Further studies have demonstrated statins affect Lp(a) levels differently in patients with dyslipidemia depending on their apo(a) phenotype; statins increase Lp(a) levels exclusively in patients with the low molecular weight apo(a) phenotype.[A181418]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

These folic acid congeners are transported across cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis where they are needed to maintain normal erythropoiesis, synthesize purine and thymidylate nucleic acids, interconvert amino acids, methylate tRNA, and generate and use formate. Using vitamin B12 as a cofactor, folic acid can normalize high homocysteine levels by remethylation of homocysteine to methionine via methionine synthetase.', 'Folic acid is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin found in foods such as liver, kidney, yeast, and leafy, green vegetables. Also known as folate or Vitamin B9, folic acid is an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in DNA and RNA synthesis. More specifically, folic acid is required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. Folic acid is the precursor of tetrahydrofolic acid, which is involved as a cofactor for transformylation reactions in the biosynthesis of purines and thymidylates of nucleic acids. Impairment of thymidylate synthesis in patients with folic acid deficiency is thought to account for the defective deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis that leads to megaloblast formation and megaloblastic and macrocytic anemias. Folic acid is particularly important during phases of rapid cell division, such as infancy, pregnancy, and erythropoiesis, and plays a protective factor in the development of cancer. As humans are unable to synthesize folic acid endogenously, diet and supplementation is necessary to prevent deficiencies. In order to function properly within the body, folic acid must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted by anti-metabolite therapies such as [DB00563] as they function as DHFR inhibitors to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, and therefore prevent the formation of DHF and THF.

Concurrently, as one of the most commonly utilized forms of vitamin D, cholecalciferol is also very frequently used as a supplement in individuals to maintain sufficient vitamin d levels in the body or to treat vitamin D deficiency, as well as various medical conditions that can be associated directly or indirectly with vitamin d insufficiency like osteoporosis and chronic kidney disease, among others [A176041, A176044, F4051].', 'Most individuals naturally generate adequate amounts of vitamin D through ordinary dietary intake of vitamin D (in some foods like eggs, fish, and cheese) and natural photochemical conversion of the vitamin D3 precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin via exposure to sunlight [L5689, F4027, F4042, F4048].



Conversely, vitamin D deficiency can often occur from a combination of insufficient exposure to sunlight, inadequate dietary intake of vitamin D, genetic defects with endogenous vitamin D receptor, or even severe liver or kidney disease [A243]. Such deficiency is known for resulting in conditions like rickets or osteomalacia, all of which reflect inadequate mineralization of bone, enhanced compensatory skeletal demineralization, resultant decreased calcium ion blood concentrations, and increases in the production and secretion of parathyroid hormone [A223]. Increases in parathyroid hormone stimulate the mobilization of skeletal calcium and the renal excretion of phosphorus [A223]. This enhanced mobilization of skeletal calcium leads towards porotic bone conditions [A223].



Ordinarily, while vitamin D3 is made naturally via photochemical processes in the skin, both itself and vitamin D2 can be found in various food and pharmaceutical sources as dietary supplements. The principal biological function of vitamin D is the maintenance of normal levels of serum calcium and phosphorus in the bloodstream by enhancing the efficacy of the small intestine to absorb these minerals from the diet [A223]. At the liver, vitamin D3 or D2 is hydroxylated to 25-hydroxyvitamin D and then finally to the primary active metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in the kidney via further hydroxylation [A223, A243]. This final metabolite binds to endogenous vitamin d receptors, which results in a variety of regulatory roles - including maintaining  calcium balance, the regulation of parathyroid hormone, the promotion of the renal reabsorption of calcium, increased intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus, and increased calcium and phosphorus mobilization of calcium and phosphorus from bone to plasma to maintain balanced levels of each in bone and the plasma [A223, A243].



In particular, calcitriol interacts with vitamin D receptors in the small intestine to enhance the efficiency of intestinal calcium and phosphorous absorption from about 10-15% to 30-40% and 60% increased to 80%, respectively [L5689]. Furthermore, calcitriol binds with vitamin D receptors in osteoblasts to stimulate a receptor activator of nuclear factor kB ligand (or RANKL) which subsequently interacts with receptor activator of nuclear factor kB (NFkB) on immature preosteoclasts, causing them to become mature bone-resorbing osteoclasts [L5689]. Such mature osteoclasts ultimately function in removing calcium and phosphorus from bone to maintain blood calcium and phosphorus levels [L5689]. Moreover, calcitriol also stimulates calcium reabsorption from the glomerular filtrate in the kidneys [L5689].



Additionally, it is believed that when calcitriol binds with nuclear vitamin D receptors, that this bound complex itself binds to retinoic acid X receptor (RXR) to generate a heterodimeric complex that consequently binds to specific nucleotide sequences in the DNA called vitamin D response elements [L5689]. When bound, various transcription factors attach to this complex, resulting in either up or down-regulation of the associated gene''s activity. It is thought that there may be as much as 200 to 2000 genes that possess vitamin D response elements or that are influenced indirectly to control a multitude of genes across the genome [L5689].  It is in this way that cholecalciferol is believed to function in regulating gene transcription associated with cancer risk, autoimmune disorders, and cardiovascular disease linked to vitamin D deficiency [L5689]. In fact, there has been some research to suggest calcitriol may also be able to prevent malignancies by inducing cellular maturation and inducing apoptosis and inhibiting angiogenesis, exhibit anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting foam cell formation and promoting angiogenesis in endothelial colony-forming cells in vitro, inhibit immune reactions by enhancing the transcription of endogenous antibiotics like cathelicidin and regulate the activity and differentiation of CD4+ T cells, amongst a variety of other proposed actions [L5689].   ', 'The in vivo synthesis of the predominant two biologically active metabolites of vitamin D occurs in two steps. The first hydroxylation of vitamin D3 cholecalciferol (or D2) occurs in the liver to yield 25-hydroxyvitamin D while the second hydroxylation happens in the kidneys to give 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D [F4027, F4042, F4048]. These vitamin D metabolites subsequently facilitate the active absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the small intestine, serving to increase serum calcium and phosphate levels sufficiently to allow bone mineralization [F4027, F4042, F4048]. Conversely, these vitamin D metabolites also assist in mobilizing calcium and phosphate from bone and likely increase the reabsorption of calcium and perhaps also of phosphate via the renal tubules [F4027, F4042, F4048]. There exists a period of 10 to 24 hours between the administration of cholecalciferol and the initiation of its action in the body due to the necessity of synthesis of the active vitamin D metabolites in the liver and kidneys [F4027, F4042, F4048]. It is parathyroid hormone that is responsible for the regulation of such metabolism at the level of the kidneys [F4027, F4042, F4048].', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy are associated with the release of serotonin (5-HT) from enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine, presumably initiating a vomiting reflex through stimulation of 5-HT3 receptors located on vagal afferents [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Ondansetron may block the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a central release of serotonin from the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Thus, the antiemetic effect of ondansetron is probably due to the selective antagonism of 5-HT3 receptors on neurons located in either the peripheral or central nervous systems, or both [F3178, F3181, F3184].



Although the mechanisms of action of ondansetron in treating postoperative nausea and vomiting and cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting may share similar pathways, the role of ondansetron in opiate-induced emesis has not yet been formally established [F3181, F3184].', 'Ondansetron is a highly specific and selective serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist, not shown to have activity at other known serotonin receptors and with low affinity for dopamine receptors [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161]. The serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery, and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161]. The temporal relationship between the emetogenic action of emetogenic drugs and the release of serotonin, as well as the efficacy of antiemetic agents, suggest that chemotherapeutic agents release serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine by causing degenerative changes in the GI tract [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161]. The serotonin then stimulates the vagal and splanchnic nerve receptors that project to the medullary vomiting center, as well as the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors in the area postrema, thus initiating the vomiting reflex, causing nausea and vomiting [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161].



Moreover, the effect of ondansetron on the QTc interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo and positive (moxifloxacin) controlled, crossover study in 58 healthy adult men and women [F3181, F3184]. Ondansetron was tested at single doses of 8 mg and 32 mg infused intravenously over 15 minutes [F3181, F3184]. At the highest tested dose of 32 mg, prolongation of the Fridericia-corrected QTc interval (QT/RR0.33=QTcF) was observed from 15 min to 4 h after the start of the 15 min infusion, with a maximum mean (upper limit of 90% CI) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline-correction of 19.6 (21.5) msec at 20 min [F3181, F3184]. At the lower tested dose of 8 mg, QTc prolongation was observed from 15 min to 1 h after the start of the 15-minute infusion, with a maximum mean (upper limit of 90% CI) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline-correction of 5.8 (7.8) msec at 15 min [F3181, F3184]. The magnitude of QTc prolongation with ondansetron is expected to be greater if the infusion rate is faster than 15 minutes [F3181, F3184]. The 32 mg intravenous dose of ondansetron must not be administered [F3181, F3184].

An ECG assessment study has not been performed for orally administered ondansetron [F3181, F3184]. On the basis of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling, an 8 mg oral dose of ondansetron is predicted to cause a mean QTcF increase of 0.7 ms (90% CI -2.1, 3.3) at steady-state, assuming a mean maximal plasma concentration of 24.7 ng/mL (95% CI 21.1, 29.0) [F3181, F3184].

Daptomycin is not indicated for the treatment of pneumonia or left-sided infective endocarditis due to _S. aureus_. Use is not recommended in pediatric patients younger than one year of age due to the risk of potential effects on muscular, neuromuscular, and/or nervous systems (either peripheral and/or

central).[L32534]



As with all antibacterial drugs, it is strongly suggested to perform sufficient testing before treatment initiation in order to confirm an infection caused by susceptible bacteria. Failure to do so may result in suboptimal treatment, treatment failure, and the development of drug-resistant bacteria.[L32534]', 'The mechanism of action of daptomycin remains poorly understood. Studies have suggested a direct inhibition of cell membrane/cell wall constituent biosynthesis, including peptidoglycan, uridine diphosphate-N-acid, acetyl-L-alanine, and lipoteichoic acid (LTA). However, no convincing evidence has been presented for any of these models, and an effect on LTA biosynthesis has been ruled out by other studies in _S. aureus_ and _E. faecalis_.[A231384, A231394, A14171]



It is well understood that free daptomycin (apo-daptomycin) is a trianion at physiological pH, which binds Ca<sup>2+</sup> in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio to become a monoanion, which is thought to rely primarily on the Asp(7), Asp(9), and L-3MeGlu12 residues that form a DXDG motif.[A231374, A231379, A231384] Calcium-binding facilitates daptomycin''s insertion into bacterial membranes preferentially due to their high content of the acidic phospholipids phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CL), wherein it is proposed that daptomycin can bind two calcium equivalents and form oligomers.[A231379] PG is recognized as the main membrane requirement for daptomycin activity; daptomycin preferentially localizes in PG-rich membrane domains, and mutations affecting PG prevalence are linked to daptomycin resistance.[A231379] Calcium-dependent membrane binding is the generally accepted mechanism of action for daptomycin, but the precise downstream effects are unclear, and numerous models have been proposed.



One mechanism proposes that the daptomycin membrane binding alters membrane fluidity, causing dissociation of cell wall biosynthetic enzymes such as the lipid II synthase MurG and the phospholipid synthase PlsX.[A231384] This is consistent with the observed effects of daptomycin on cell shape in various bacteria at concentrations at or above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).[A14171] Aberrant cell morphology is also consistent with the observed localization of daptomycin at the division septa and a hypothesized role in inhibiting cell division.[A231379] A recent study suggested the formation of tripartite complexes containing calcium-bound daptomycin, PG, and various undecaprenyl-coupled cell envelope precursors, which subsequently include lipid II. This complex is proposed to inhibit cell division, lead to the dispersion of cell wall biosynthetic machinery, and eventually cause lysis of the membrane bilayer at the septum causing cell death.[A231384, A231409]



Another popular model is based on early observations that daptomycin, in a calcium-dependent manner, caused potassium ion leakage and loss of membrane potential in treated bacterial cells.[A231394, A231419, A231424] Although this lead some to suggest that daptomycin could bind PG to form oligomeric pores in the bacterial membrane,[A231384] no cell lysis was observed in _S. aureus_ or _E. faecalis_,[A231379] and the daptomycin-induced ion conduction is inconsistent with pore formation.[A231429] Rather, it has been proposed that daptomycin forms calcium-dependent dimeric complexes in fixed ratios of Dap<sub>2</sub>Ca<sub>3</sub>PG<sub>2</sub>, which can act as transient ionophores.[A231429] The observed loss of membrane potential is suggested to result in a non-specific loss of gradient-dependent nutrient transport, ATP production, and biosynthesis, leading to cell death.[A231379, A231424]



Notably, these models are not strictly mutually exclusive and are supported to varying extents by observed resistance mutations. The strict requirement for PG for daptomycin bactericidal action is supported by mutations in _mprF_, _cls2_, _pgsA_, and the _dlt_ operon in _S. aureus_, _cls_ in various enterococci, and _pgsA_, PG synthase, and the _dlt_ operon in _E. faecium_, all of which alter the bacterial membrane composition and specifically the PG content of bacterial membranes. Other noted mutations in various regulatory systems that control membrane homeostasis also support the cell membrane as the site of daptomycin action. Curiously, in _E. faecalis_, the most commonly observed form of daptomycin resistance is characterized by abnormal division septa, which supports the cell division-based mechanism of daptomycin action.[A231379, A231384]', 'Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide antibacterial agent produced as a fermentation product by the soil microbe _Streptomyces roseosporus_. The daptomycin core consists of 13 amino acids, including three D-amino acids, ornithine, 3-methyl-glutamic acid, and kynurenine, with the C-terminal 10 amino acids forming an ester-linked ring and the N-terminal tryptophan covalently bonded to decanoic acid.[A231374, L32534] Daptomycin is active against aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, including clinically relevant strains such as methicillin-susceptible and -resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MSSA/MRSA), vancomycin-resistant _S. aureus_, vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE),  _Staphylococcus_ spp., _Streptococcus_ spp., _Clostridiodes difficile_, _Clostridium perfringens_, _Finegoldia magna_, and _Propionibacterium acnes_, among others.[A231379, A231384, L32534] Although daptomycin is active against _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ _in vitro_, it is inhibited by lung surfactant, and hence is not effective for the treatment of pneumonia or other similar lung infections.[A231379, A231389, L32534] Daptomycin exhibits rapid concentration-dependent bactericidal activity _in vitro_, which correlates best with the ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve to the minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) in animal models of infection.[L32534] 



Like other antibacterial agents, daptomycin carries a risk of severe hypersensitivity reactions, including Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS). There have been reports of myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, and increased creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels in patients taking daptomycin, which increased when daptomycin was given more than once per day. Patients should be monitored for CPK levels and, in those with renal impairment, renal function, at least once per week and should consider temporarily suspending the use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Daptomycin should not be administered more than once per day. Severe adverse reactions such as tubulointerstitial nephritis and peripheral neuropathy have been reported, which may require treatment discontinuation. Based on animal studies, patients less than one year of age may experience serious muscular, neuromuscular, and nervous system effects; daptomycin is not recommended for use in patients under one year of age. Patients undergoing daptomycin treatment may experience eosinophilic pneumonia and _Clostridioides difficile_-associated diarrhea, both of which may require the cessation of antibacterial treatment and initiation of symptomatic/supportive measures. Persisting or relapsing _S. aureus_ bacteremia and endocarditis should be investigated for sequestered foci of infection and the possibility of daptomycin resistance; the dose or treatment regimen may require adjusting. Patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatine clearance < 50 mL/min) experienced reduced clinical benefit from daptomycin treatment based on limited data. Clinically relevant daptomycin plasma concentrations have significantly affected prothrombin time and International Normalized Ratio (INR) measurements. As with all antibiotics, daptomycin use may promote the overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms and the development of resistant organisms; daptomycin use should be limited to cases where it is proven or strongly suspected that an infection is caused by susceptible bacteria.[L32534]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Also for the treatment of known or suspected cyanide poisoning.', 'Vitamin B12 exists in four major forms referred to collectively as cobalamins; deoxyadenosylcobalamin, methylcobalamin, hydroxocobalamin, and cyanocobalamin. Two of these, methylcobalamin and 5-deoxyadenosyl cobalamin, are primarily used by the body. Methionine synthase needs methylcobalamin as a cofactor. This enzyme is involved in the conversion of the amino acid homocysteine into methionine. Methionine in turn is required for DNA methylation. 5-Deoxyadenosyl cobalamin is a cofactor needed by the enzyme that converts L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. This conversion is an important step in the extraction of energy from proteins and fats. Furthermore, succinyl CoA is necessary for the production of hemoglobin, the substances that carries oxygen in red blood cells.', 'Hydroxocobalamin is a synthetic, injectable form of Vitamin B12. Hydroxocobalamin is actually a precursor of two cofactors or vitamins (Vitamin B12 and Methylcobalamin) which are involved in various biological systems in man. Vitamin B12 is required for the conversion of methylmalonate to succinate. Deficiency of this enzyme could therefore interfere with the production of lipoprotein in myelin sheath tissue and so give rise to neurological lesions. The second cofactor, Methylcobalamin, is necessary for the conversion of homocysteine to methionine which is essential for the metabolism of folic acid. Deficiency of tetrahydrafolate leads to reduced synthesis of thymidylate resulting in reduced synthesis of DNA which is essential for cell maturation. Vitamin B12 is also concerned in the maintenance of sulphydryl groups in reduced form, deficiency leading to decreased amounts of reduced SH content of erythrocytes and liver cells. Overall, vitamin B12 acts as a coenzyme for various metabolic functions, including fat and carbohydrate metabolism and protein synthesis. It is necessary for growth, cell replication, hematopoiesis, and nucleoprotein as well as myelin synthesis. This is largely due to its effects on metabolism of methionine folic acid, and malonic acid.', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Under EMA approval, such fish oil pharmaceuticals comprised of virtually the same fish and fish oil derived omega-3-fatty acids EPA and DHA are indicated specifically for (a) adjuvant treatment in secondary prevention after myocardial infarction, in addition to other standard therapy (ie. statins, antiplatelet medicinal products, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors), and (b) as a supplement to diet when dietary measures alone are insufficient to produce an adequate response, particularly with type IV hypertriglyceridemia in monotherapy or type IIb/III in combination with statins, when control of triglycerides is insufficient [L2661]. In addition, prescribing information for EMA approved fish oil pharmaceuticals are also indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce very high (>=500 mg/dL) triglyceride levels in adult patients, much like similar FDA approved indications [F37, FDA Label].', 'The specific mechanism of action by which the fish oil EPA and DHA acids are capable of reducing serum triglyceride levels is not yet fully understood [FDA Label, A32933]. Nevertheless, it is proposed that such omega-3-fatty acids may not be the preferred substrates of the enzyme diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase that participates in the generation of triglycerides; that  they might interact with nuclear transcription factors that manage lipogenesis; or that their presence and increase in levels can cause cellular metabolism to subsequently shift toward a decrease in triglyceride synthesis and an increase in fatty acid oxidation [A32933]. Moreover, the EPA and DHA acids are also believed to be able to promote apolipoprotein B degradation in the liver through the stimulation of an autophagic process [A32933]. It may also be possible that these fish oil acids can accelerate the clearance of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles and chylomicron [A32933]. The combination of all these actions results in fewer VLDL particles being assembled and secreted, which is of considerable importance as VLDL particles are the major endogenous source of triglycerides [A32933].



Moreover, new paradigms of how inflammation is contained and dissipated involve various newly discovered chemical mediators, resolvins, and protectins [A32933]. Such agents are believed to be directly involved in blocking neutrophil migration, infiltration, recruitment, as well as blocking T-cell migration and promoting T-cell apoptosis [A32933]. Additionally, such protectins can also reduce tumor necrosis factor and interferon secretion [A32933]. Of particular importance, however, is the fact that protectins and resolvins are exclusively derived from omega-3-fatty acids and that EPA is the substrate of the resolvins family and DHA can be converted to both resolvins and protectins [A32933]. It is believed that these effects of such fish oil acids underlie the actions that fish oil have demonstrated on eliciting stability for vulnerable inflammatory plaques [A32933].



Finally, fish oil acids have demonstrated certain direct electrophysiological effects on the myocardium [A32933]. In animal studies, it was shown that the ventricular fibrillation threshold could be increased in both animals fed or infused with omega-3-fatty acids [A32933]. Further studies subsequently revealed that such fatty acids could reduce both sodium currents and L-type calcium currents on a cellular and ion channel level [A32933]. It is consequently hypothesized that during ischemia, a reduction in the sodium ion current protects hyperexcitable tissue, and a reduction in the calcium ion current could reduce arrhythmogenic depolarizing currents - and that perhaps the use of EPA and DHA fish oil acids could facilitate such activity [A32933]. For the time being, however, omega-3-fatty acids in pharmaceutical supplement form have not been shown to elicit such protection against heart conditions [L2662].', 'In general, the only practical method of obtaining and increasing the levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) fish oil omega-3-fatty acids in the body is to consume them directly from foods and/or dietary supplements [L784]. Having EPA and DHA is important because they facilitate numerous important functions in the human body. As an example, such supplementation of fish oil EPA and DHA demonstrates a legitimate ability to decrease triglyceride levels as their presence in the body can act as poor substrates for the enzymes that are ordinarily responsible for triglyceride synthesis and also inhibit the esterification of other fatty acids, among other mechanisms [FDA Label, L2661].



Moreover, such fish oil acids can become important components of the phospholipids that form the structures of cell membranes [L784]. Specifically, DHA is particularly high in the retina, brain, and sperm [L784]. Additionally, these acids also provide energy for the body and are used to form eicosanoids - signaling molecules that have similar chemical structures to the fish oil fatty acids from which they are derived [L784]. Furthermore, such eicosanoids possess wide-ranging functions in the cardiovascular, pulmonary, immune, and endocrine systems [L784].', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

When they reach the small intestines, drug conjugates can undergo hydrolysis and return to the enterohepatic circulation. Activated charcoal interferes with this process and binds to the conjugated drug before hydrolysis or the free deconjugated drug before reabsorption. ', 'Activated charcoal is used as a gastric decontamination agent in emergency clinical settings in case of poison or medication overdose. Studies show that early administration of one dose of activated charcoal can adsorb poison in the stomach and reduce absorption while it also works long after ingestion, by interruption of enterohepatic and enterovascular cycling of poison.

', '**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].



Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].



In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].



There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].



Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].



The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. 



In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].



In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].



The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].', 'Zinc is involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of human proteins may bind zinc, in addition to hundreds of proteins that transport and traffic zinc. It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is an essential element for a proper sense of taste and smell and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations [L2211].



Studies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions [L2095]:



**Colds:** Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently [L2095].



**Wound healing:** Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements [L2095]. 



**Diahrrea**: Oral zinc supplements can reduce the symptoms of diarrhea in children with low levels of zinc, especially in cases of malnutrition [L2095].

[L39095] Patients may experience ED due to a variety of causes including psychogenic, neurogenic, vasculogenic, iatrogenic, or endocrine. [A242392] These causes result in dysfunction of penile smooth muscle relaxation through either disrupted neuronal signaling or direct influence on smooth muscle cells. During sexual arousal, non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) neurons release nitric oxide (NO). Nitric oxide stimulates guanylate cyclase which converts guanosine triphosphate to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).[A242287, A242377] cGMP activates the cGMP-dependent kinase (PKG) in a signal cascade which activates K+ channels leading to inhibition of Ca2+ channels, inhibits platelet activation, and inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation while inducing apoptosis. This signal cascade is attenuated by PDE5 which breaks the phosphodiester bond of cGMP, converting it to GMP. Inhibition of PDE5 by tadalafil increases signaling via the PKG cascade which supports penile smooth muscle relaxation during sexual arousal by decreasing Ca2+ entry into smooth muscle cells. This smooth muscle relaxation allows blood to fill the corpus cavernosum thereby producing an erection.



In PAH, blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries is raised due to a variety of mechanisms stemming from endothelial dysfunction.[A242377] Decreased production of NO and prostacyclin reduce vasodilatory signaling while overproduction of endothelin-1 and thromboxane increase vasoconstriction. Inflammation, thromboses, and hypoxia later contribute to vascular remodeling which further reduces luminal size. The resultant increase in blood pressure reduces the capacity for gas exchange and increases afterload at the right ventricle, producing symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and dizziness as well as leading to right-sided heart failure. Tadalafil exerts its therapeutic effect in PAH through boosting NO-cGMP signaling to contribute to smooth muscle relaxation as with ED.



Lastly, tadalafil is used to treat BPH.[L39095] BPH produces urinary dysfunction through hyperproliferation of the epithelial and smooth muscle layers of the prostate.[A242382] The increased size of the prostate blocks urine flow through the urethra resulting in higher residual volumes due to incomplete emptying. Tadalafil does not appear to exert its benefit via smooth muscle relaxation of the prostate. It may instead exert its effect through a mix of increased oxygenation and decreased inflammation, which decreases tissue remodeling, and inhibition of cell proliferation through the cGMP cascade.



The decreased affinity for PDE6 compared to other PDE5 inhibitors may explain the decreased incidence of visual side effects as PDE6 is present in the eye and contributes to color vision.[L39100, L39105, A242287]', 'Tadalafil exerts a therapeutic effect in ED by increasing sexual stimulation-dependant smooth muscle relaxation in the penis, allowing the corpus cavernosum to fill with blood to produce an erection.[A242287, A242377] Smooth muscle relaxation in the pulmonary vasculature helps to produce vasodilation in PAH which reduces blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries.[A242377] In BPH, tadalafil may contribute to decreased smooth muscle cell proliferation which may reduce the size of the prostate and relieve the anatomical obstruction which produces urinary symptoms of BPH.[A242382] The decreased affinity of tadalafil for PDE6 compared to other PDE5 inhibitors may explain the reduced incidence of visual side effects.[L39100, L39105, A242287]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

By doing so, it inhibits acid secretion into the gsatric lumen. This effect is dose-related and leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus.



Esomeprazole is the s-isomer of [DB00338], which is a racemate of the S- and R-enantiomer. Esomeprazole has been shown to inhibit acid secretion to a similar extent as [DB00338], without any significant differences between the two compounds _in vitro_. 



PPIs such as esomeprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]



Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as esomeprazole has been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Taking iron in supplement form, such as ferrous sulfate, allows for more rapid increases in iron levels when dietary supply and stores are not sufficient.[L2175] Iron is transported by the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) across the endolysosomal membrane to enter the macrophage. It can then can be incorporated into ferritin and be stored in the macrophage or carried of the macrophage by ferroportin.

As an active agent indicated for relieving certain cold symptoms and/or certain muscular sprains and cramps, it is believed that eucalyptus oil may possess some antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities.



Some in vitro studies of human blood monocytes suggest a dose-dependent effect of eucalyptus oil to elicit significant inhibition of multiple cytokines, perhaps in the treatment of airway inflammation [A32244, A32245]. Moreover, other studies in animal models discuss the possibility of eucalyptus oil demonstrating anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects that potentially account for inhibiting the formation of prostaglandins and cytokines by stimulated monocytes in vitro [A32246, A32247].



Furthermore, additional studies have observed eucalyptus oil anti-viral activity against herpes simplex virus (HSV-1, HSV-2) in cell cultures as well as the demonstration of broad antimicrobial activity of eucalyptus medicinal plant extracts against Alicyclobacillus acidoterretris, Bacillus cereus, E. coli, Enterococcus faecalis, MRSA, Propionibacterium acnes, S. aureus, fungus including C. albicans isolates, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and other Gram-positive bacteria.

DNA gyrase is an enzyme found only in bacteria that introduces negative supercoils into DNA during replication - this helps to relieve torsional strain caused by the introduction of positive supercoils during replication, and these negative supercoils are essential for chromosome condensation and the promotion of transcription initiation.[A31453] It is comprised of four subunits (two A subunits and two B subunits) of which the A subunits appear to be the target of fluoroquinolone antibiotics.[A190663] Bacterial topoisomerase IV, in addition to contributing to the relaxation of positive supercoils, is essential at the terminal stages of DNA replication and functions to “unlink” newly replicated chromosomes to allow for the completion of cell division.[A31453]



Inhibition of these enzymes by levofloxacin likely occurs via complexation with the topoisomerase enzymes.[A31453] The end result is a blockade of DNA replication, thus inhibiting cell division and resulting in cell death.', 'Levofloxacin is bactericidal and exerts its antimicrobial effects via inhibition of bacterial DNA replication.[L11638] It has a relatively long duration of action in comparison with other antibiotics that allows for once or twice daily dosing.

Gemcitabine is indicated for patients previously treated with [fluorouracil].[L32950]', 'Gemcitabine is a potent and specific deoxycytidine analog. After uptake into malignant cells, gemcitabine is phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase to form gemcitabine monophosphate, which is then converted to the active compounds, gemcitabine diphosphate (dFdCDP) and gemcitabine triphosphate (dFdCTP). These active metabolites are nucleosides that mediate antitumour effects. dFdCTP competes with deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) for incorporation into DNA, thereby competitively inhibiting DNA chain elongation. The non-terminal position of dFdCTP in the DNA chain prevents detection of dFdCTP in the chain and repair by proof-reading 3′5′-exonuclease: this process is referred to as "masked DNA chain termination." Incorporation of dFdCTP into the DNA chain ultimately leads to chain termination, DNA fragmentation, and apoptotic cell death of malignant cells.[A233140,A233145,L32950]



Gemcitabine has self-potentiating pharmacological actions that can increase the probability of successful incorporation of gemcitabine triphosphate into the DNA chain: dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, an enzyme responsible for catalyzing the reactions that generate dCTP for DNA synthesis. Since dFdCDP reduces the levels of dCTP, there is less competition for gemcitabine triphosphate for incorporation into DNA.[A233140,L32950] Gemcitabine can also reduce metabolism and elimination of active metabolites from the target ce1l, prolonging high intracellular concentrations of the active metabolites.

It displayed schedule-dependent antitumour activity in various animal models and xenografts from human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreatic cancer.[A233140] Therefore, the antineoplastic effects of gemcitabine are enhanced through prolonged infusion time rather than higher dosage.[A233140] Gemcitabine inhibited the growth of human xenografts from carcinoma of the lung, pancreas, ovaries, head and neck, and breast. In mice, gemcitabine inhibited the growth of human tumour xenografts from the breast, colon, lung or pancreas by 69 to 99%. In clinical trials of advanced NSCLC, gemcitabine monotherapy produced objective response rates ranging from 18 to 26%, with a median duration of response ranging from 3.3 to 12.7 months. Overall median survival time was 6.2 to 12.3 months. The combined use of cisplatin and gemcitabine produced better objective response rates compared to monotherapy. In patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, objective response rates in patients ranged from 5.to 12%, with a median survival duration of 3.9 to 6.3 months.[A233145] In Phase II trials involving patients with metastatic breast cancer, treatment with gemcitabine alone or with adjuvant chemotherapies resulted in response rate ranging from 13 to 42% and median survival duration ranging from 11.5 to 17.8 months. In metastatic bladder cancer, gemcitabine has a response rate 20 to 28%.

By doing so, it inhibits acid secretion into the gsatric lumen. This effect is dose-related and leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus.



Esomeprazole is the s-isomer of [DB00338], which is a racemate of the S- and R-enantiomer. Esomeprazole has been shown to inhibit acid secretion to a similar extent as [DB00338], without any significant differences between the two compounds _in vitro_. 



PPIs such as esomeprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]



Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as esomeprazole has been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

', 'It is suggested that aloe polysaccharides mediate skin-protectant effects in damaged skin, induced by internal or other external factors such as radiation, via inhibiting apoptosis of normal cell lines _in vitro_ and thrombocytes _in vivo_ [A32473]. Following irradiation, aloe polysaccharides block the upregulation of pro-apoptotic p53, Bax, and Bad while blocking downregulating anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 [A32473]. _In vivo_, aloe polysaccharides may act as a scavenger for oxygen free radicals including DPPH, alkyl radicals, superoxides, and singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals that may also be generated by superoxides [A32470, A32476]. Hydrogen peroxide, which is a weak initiate lipid peroxidation, may also be effectively scavenged by aloe polysaccharides [A32476]. In a Fenton reaction system, aloe polysaccharides demonstrated a concentration-dependent scavenging activity against hydroxyl radical that were generated during the reaction [A32476]. Aloe polysaccharides may also compete with oxygen to react with nitric oxide (NO), thereby inhibiting the generation of nitrite and peroxynitrite anions that act as free radicals [A32476]. 



Findings from a study investigating the effects of aloe polysaccharides on doxorubicin-induced oxidative stress suggest that aloe polysaccharides mediate potent antioxidant actions _in vivo_ [A32476]. Doxorubicin, known to generate reactive oxygen species such as superoxide and hydroxy radicals, was administered to albino rats. This led to myocardial oxidative stress and cardiac injury accompanied by leakage of LDH and CPK from cardiac myocytes and to serum due to lipid peroxidation of cardiac membranes, reduced levels of antioxidant coenzyme GSH, and increased levels of SOD from a compensatory and combative mechanism of oxidative stress [A32476]. Treatment with aloe polysaccharides resulted in a significant decrease in serum LDH and CPK levels, indicating that aloe polysaccharides are capable in stabilizing cardiac membranes from peroxidative damage. Restored levels of endogenous GSH and SOD in a dose-dependent manner were also observed with the treatment of aloe polysaccharides, suggesting that aloe polysaccharides exhibit potent antioxidant properties [A32476].



In a study of rats with open cutaneous back wounds, treatment with aloe polysaccharides decreased the levels of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) and induced tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) during the early stage of wound repair, resulting in decreased collagen breakdown and increased preservation of collagen content in the injured area [A32471]. A study proposes that acemannan, a common aloe polysaccharide, stimulates BMSC proliferation, ALPase activity, expression of VEGF, BMP-2, OPN, BSP, and mineralization leading to osteoblast differentiation and bone formation during socket healing [A32475]. ', 'Aloe polysaccharides mediate antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions, as well as immunoregulatory activities. Various studies indicate that aloe polysaccharides possess effective free radical scavenging activity _in vitro_, and produce potent antioxidant potential during oxidative stress _in vivo_ [A32476]. According to the findings of studies _in vitro_ and _in vivo_, aloe polysaccharides exhibit radioprotective activity. Treatment with acemmanan, which is a common aloe polysaccharide, on CH3 mice with radiation-induced skin reactions resulted in reduced signs of those reactions [A32473]. Studies suggest that aloe polysaccharides may evidently attenuate tumor growth in mice [A32473]. Treatment of aloe polysaccharides in Vero cells as well as in the in vivo zebrafish model led to protective effects against AAPH-indued oxidative stress resulting from accumulation of free radical species and improved cell viability [A32470].

The antiinflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> inhibitory proteins, lipocortins, which control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Mometasone furoate has been shown in vitro to exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor which is approximately 12 times that of dexamethasone, 7 times that of triamcinolone acetonide, 5 times that of budesonide, and 1.5 times that of fluticasone.', 'Mometasone is a medium-potency synthetic corticosteroid with antiinflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties.

Unique among the azoles, miconazole is thought to act through three main mechanisms.[A203636] The primary mechanism of action is through inhibition of the CYP450 14α-lanosterol demethylase enzyme, which results in altered ergosterol production and impaired cell membrane composition and permeability, which in turn leads to cation, phosphate, and low molecular weight protein leakage.[A203636, A203639]



In addition, miconazole inhibits fungal peroxidase and catalase while not affecting NADH oxidase activity, leading to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).[A203636, A203639, A203642] Increased intracellular ROS leads to downstream pleiotropic effects and eventual apoptosis.[A203636]



Lastly, likely as a result of lanosterol demethylation inhibition, miconazole causes a rise in intracellular levels of farnesol. This molecule participates in quorum sensing in _Candida_, preventing the transition from yeast to mycelial forms and thereby the formation of biofilms, which are more resistant to antibiotics.[A203645, A203648] In addition, farnesol is an inhibitor of drug efflux ABC transporters, namely _Candida_ CaCdr1p and CaCdr2p, which may additionally contribute to increased effectiveness of azole drugs.[A203648]', 'Miconazole is an azole antifungal that functions primarily through inhibition of a specific demethylase within the CYP450 complex.[A203636] As miconazole is typically applied topically and is minimally absorbed into the systemic circulation following application, the majority of patient reactions are limited to hypersensitivity and cases of anaphylaxis.[L14021] Patients using intravaginal miconazole products are advised not to rely on contraceptives to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, as well as not to use tampons concurrently.[L14027]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

It is also indicated for the prevention of major cardiovascular events (including risk of myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and coronary artery revascularization) in adult patients without documented history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events, but with at least two conventional risk factors for cardiovascular disease.[F4652]



Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]', 'Rosuvastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A181421] Rosuvastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which increases hepatic uptake of LDL. Rosuvastatin also inhibits hepatic synthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL).[F4649] The overall effect is a decrease in plasma LDL and VLDL. 



In vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that rosuvastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] This includes improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response.



Statins have also been found to bind allosterically to β2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and in T cell activation.[A181559]



Rosuvastatin exerts an anti-inflammatory effect on rat mesenteric microvascular endothelium by attenuating leukocyte rolling, adherence and transmigration.[A1807] The drug also modulates nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression and reduces ischemic-reperfusion injuries in rat hearts.[A1787] Rosuvastatin increases the bioavailability of nitric oxide[A1807,A1799,A1787] by upregulating NOS[A1791] and by increasing the stability of NOS through post-transcriptional polyadenylation.[A1796] It is unclear as to how rosuvastatin brings about these effects though they may be due to decreased concentrations of mevalonic acid.', 'Rosuvastatin is a synthetic, enantiomerically pure antilipemic agent. It is used to lower total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and trigleride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, rosuvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A181087, A181406]



Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]



**Skeletal Muscle Effects**



Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. These risks can occur at any dose level, but are increased at the highest dose (40 mg). Rosuvastatin should be prescribed with caution in patients with predisposing factors for myopathy (e.g., age ≥ 65 years, inadequately treated hypothyroidism, renal impairment).



The risk of myopathy during treatment with rosuvastatin may be increased with concurrent administration of some other lipid-lowering therapies (such as [fenofibrate] or [niacin]), [gemfibrozil], [cyclosporine], [atazanavir]/[ritonavir], [lopinavir]/ritonavir, or [simeprevir].  Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin, coadministered with [colchicine], and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together.[F4649] 



Real-world data from observational studies has suggested that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]



**Liver Enzyme Abnormalities**



Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. In most cases, the elevations were transient and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. There were two cases of jaundice, for which a relationship to rosuvastatin therapy could not be determined, which resolved after discontinuation of therapy. There were no cases of liver failure or irreversible liver disease in these trials.[F4649]



**Endocrine Effects**



Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin calcium tablets. Based on clinical trial data with rosuvastatin, in some instances these increases may exceed the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.[F4649]



An in vitro study found that [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], and [pitavastatin] exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on human pancreas islet β cells, with reductions in cell viability of 32, 41, 34 and 29%, respectively, versus control]. Moreover, insulin secretion rates were decreased by 34, 30, 27 and 19%, respectively, relative to control.[A182012]



HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and lower cholesterol levels and, as such, might theoretically blunt adrenal or gonadal steroid hormone production. Rosuvastatin demonstrated no effect upon nonstimulated cortisol levels and no effect on thyroid metabolism as assessed by TSH plasma concentration. In rosuvastatin treated patients, there was no impairment of adrenocortical reserve and no reduction in plasma cortisol concentrations. Clinical studies with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have suggested that these agents do not reduce plasma testosterone concentration. The effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on male fertility have not been studied. The effects, if any, on the pituitarygonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown.[F4652]



**Cardiovascular**



Ubiquinone levels were not measured in rosuvastatin clinical trials, however significant decreases in circulating ubiquinone levels in patients treated with other statins have been observed. The clinical significance of a potential long-term statin-induced deficiency of ubiquinone has not been established. It has been reported that a decrease in myocardial ubiquinone levels could lead to impaired cardiac function in patients with borderline congestive heart failure.[F4652]

It is thus desirable to maintain and reinforce lifestyle changes in high-risk patients placed on rosuvastatin therapy.[F4652] Further studies have demonstrated statins affect Lp(a) levels differently in patients with dyslipidemia depending on their apo(a) phenotype; statins increase Lp(a) levels exclusively in patients with the low molecular weight apo(a) phenotype.[A181418]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

A deficiency in iron indicates that the body cannot produce enough normal red blood cells.[A32514,L11800] Iron deficiency anemia occurs when body stores of iron decrease to very low levels, and the stored iron is insufficient to support normal red blood cell (RBC) production. Insufficient dietary iron, impaired iron absorption, bleeding, pregnancy, or loss of iron through the urine can lead to iron deficiency.[A32514,L11794]  Symptoms of iron deficiency anemia include fatigue, breathlessness, palpitations, dizziness, and headache.



Taking iron in supplement form, such as ferrous sulfate, allows for more rapid increases in iron levels when dietary supply and stores are not sufficient.[L2175] Iron is transported by the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) across the endolysosomal membrane to enter the macrophage. It can then can be incorporated into ferritin and be stored in the macrophage or carried of the macrophage by ferroportin. This exported iron is  oxidized by the enzyme to ceruloplasmin to Fe3+, followed by sequestration by transferrin for transport in the serum to various sites, including the bone marrow for hemoglobin synthesis or into the liver.[A32524] Iron combines with porphyrin and globin chains to form hemoglobin, which is critical for oxygen delivery from the lungs to other tissues.[L2263]', 'Ferrous sulfate replenishes iron, an essential component in hemoglobin, myoglobin, and various enzymes.

The mechanism of action of heparin is ATIII-dependent. It acts mainly by accelerating the rate of the neutralization of certain activated coagulation factors by antithrombin, but other mechanisms may also be involved. The antithrombotic effect of heparin is well correlated to the inhibition of factor Xa. Heparin is not a thrombolytic or fibrinolytic. It prevents progression of existing clots by inhibiting further clotting. The lysis of existing clots relies on endogenous thrombolytics.', 'Unfractionated heparin is a highly acidic mucopolysaccharide formed of equal parts of sulfated D-glucosamine and D-glucuronic acid with sulfaminic bridges.

Heparin is a well-known and commonly used anticoagulant which has antithrombotic properties. Heparin inhibits reactions that lead to the clotting of blood and the formation of fibrin clots both in vitro and in vivo. Small amounts of heparin in combination with antithrombin III, a heparin cofactor,) can inhibit thrombosis by inactivating Factor Xa and thrombin. Once active thrombosis has developed, larger amounts of heparin can inhibit further coagulation by inactivating thrombin and preventing the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin.

Hyaluronic acid works by two basic mechanisms: serving as a passive structural molecule or serving as signaling molecule, depending on the molecule size. The physicochemical properties of high molecular weight HA contribute to passive structural effects, demonstrating hygroscopicity and viscoelasticity and improving hydration, water balance, and structural integrity. As a signalling  molecule interacting with proteins, HA causes several opposing effects based on molecular weight: pro- or anti-inflammatory effects, promotion or inhibition of cell migration, and activating or inhibiting cell division.[A230133] 



Hyaluronic acid exerts its therapeutic effects through binding to three primary types of cell surface receptors: CD44 (a membrane glycoprotein), the receptor for hyaluronate-mediated motility (RHAMM), and the Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1). CD44 is considered the most widely distributed receptor for hyaluronic acid, demonstrating cellular interactions with osteopontin, collagen, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).  High and low molecular weight hyaluronic acids demonstrate differing molecular and cellular mechanisms in their interaction with CD44 receptors. Some examples of these effects include modification of chondrocyte survival pathways in addition to alteration of apoptosis pathways.  Lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor (LYVE-1), and hyaluronic acid receptor for endocytosis (HARE), (also known as Stabilin-2) also bind to hyaluronic acid.[A230128] 



Hyaluronic acid for skin conditions and cosmetics



Hyaluronic acid''s anionic proprieties cause it to attract water and induce swelling, increasing tissue volume and skin structural integrity. The aging process is associated with reduced production of skin hyaluronic acid and collagen, causing the appearance of wrinkles and the loss of facial volume. Dermal fillers of hyaluronic acid replace lost tissue volume, imparting a full and youthful appearance to skin that has lost its elasticity. Hyaluronic acid fillers contain cross-linked hyaluronic acid particles, rendering a concentrated substance with resistance to various forms of physical and chemical breakdown. The cosmetic benefits of hyaluronic acid filler may last up to 6 months, depending on the brand and technique used for injection.[L32193] Additionally, dermal hyaluronic acid fillers are known to increase the production of fibroblasts[L32193], supporting wound healing and offering relief from irritating and inflammatory skin conditions.[A230118]





Hyaluronic acid for joint pain



Most cells in the human body are capable of synthesizing HA. It is a primary component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and can be found in bone marrow, cartilage, and synovial fluid in joints.[A230128] In osteoarthritis, the concentration of naturally occurring hyaluronic acid gradually decreases, lowering the viscosity of synovial fluid that protects joints from excess friction. Administration of intra-articular hyaluronic acid increases viscosity of synovial joint fluid, reducing friction and subsequently relieving painful arthritic symptoms.[L32193]

Hypromellose also acts to lubricate and protect the eye [L1809].



The surface active properties of the vehicles found in artificial tears solutions act to stabilize the tear film and increase tear viscosity to prevent delay tear evaporation and delay tear drainage [L1805].



In the intact eye, the corneal surface is moistened primarily by the mucin that is produced in the conjunctiva. Mucin is adsorbed on the corneal surface and forms a hydrophilic surface. This creates a moisture barrier. In the typical dry eye, and particularly in case of mucin deficiency, the application of artificial tear fluid is highly recommended. Both its surface activity and its adsorptive capacity make hypromellose optimal for this use. Hypromellose has a physical-chemical action and leads to, in an aqueous solution, a reduced surface tension as well as an increased level of viscosity. Hypromellose adheres well to the cornea and conjunctiva and provides ample moisture. Irritation symptoms caused by blinking, which occur in the case of tear fluid deficiency, are therefore decreased and symptoms of epithelial desiccation are also alleviated [L1809].



', 'Hypromellose is the most commonly used in hydrophilic matrix fabrication. It allows for controlled release of drug substances, increasing duration of therapeutic effects [L1803].  The physical characteristics of this drug resemble natural tears, providing lubrication to the ocular surface and maintaining corneal hydration in dry eye syndromes [L1811].



Hypromellose is considered an inert substance as it has no direct pharmacological activity. The viscosity promoting properties of hypromellose prolong the retention time and improve adhesion of synthetic tears to the cornea and conjunctiva. As a result, the tear film breakdown time is prolonged and/or the tear film stability is enhanced. A stable tear film protects the cornea from dryness and epithelial cells [L1809].

Current knowledge suggests that levetiracetam’s binding to synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) is a key driver of its action. SV2A is a membrane-bound protein that is found on synaptic vesicles and is ubiquitous throughout the CNS[A12546] - it appears to play a role in vesicle exocytosis[L8606,L8615] and in the modulation of synaptic transmission by increasing the available amount of secretory vesicles available for neurotransmission.[A12552] Stimulation of pre-synaptic SV2A by levetiracetam may inhibit neurotransmitter release,[A12551] but this action does not appear to affect normal neurotransmission. This has led to the suggestion that levetiracetam exclusively modulates the function of SV2A only under pathophysiological conditions.[A12546] Levetiracetam and related analogues showed a correlation between affinity for SV2A and anti-epileptic potency, further suggesting that action at this site contributes to the anti-epileptic activity of the drug.[L8606,L8615]



Levetiracetam has also been shown to indirectly affect GABAergic neurotransmission (despite having no direct effect on GABAergic or glutamatergic receptors) and modulate ionic currents.[A12552] Similarly, levetiracetam has been shown in vitro to inhibit N-type calcium channels.[A16562] How, or even if, these actions are implicated in its anti-epileptic action have yet to be elucidated.', 'Levetiracetam appears to prevent seizure activity via the selective inhibition of hypersynchronized epileptiform burst firing without affecting normal neuronal transmission, though the exact mechanism through which this occurs is unclear.[L8606,L8615] The therapeutic index of levetiracetam is wide,[L8615,A185918] making it relatively unique amongst other anti-epileptic medications.

', '**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].



Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].



In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].



There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].



Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].



The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. 



In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].



In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].



The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].', 'Zinc is involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of human proteins may bind zinc, in addition to hundreds of proteins that transport and traffic zinc. It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is an essential element for a proper sense of taste and smell and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations [L2211].



Studies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions [L2095]:



**Colds:** Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently [L2095].



**Wound healing:** Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements [L2095]. 



**Diahrrea**: Oral zinc supplements can reduce the symptoms of diarrhea in children with low levels of zinc, especially in cases of malnutrition [L2095].

Salicylic acid competitively inhibits oxidation of uridine-5-diphosphoglucose (UDPG) with nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide (NAD) and noncompetitively with UDPG.

Additionally, lactulose is also employed as an adjunct to protein restriction and supportive therapy for the prevention and treatment of portal-systemic encephalopathy (PSE), including both the hepatic pre-coma and coma variations.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] In particular, lactulose solution has been effective at managing PSE resulting from surgical portacaval shunts or from chronic hepatic diseases like cirrhosis.[L6199]



Moreover, there have also been studies demonstrating the capacity for lactulose to minimize the formation of gallstones and even some investigations regarding the experimental use of the agent in developing novel anticancer agents owing to its ability to bind galactin carbohydrates involved in various tumor progressions [L6202].', 'Lactulose is a synthetic disaccharide derivative of lactose that consists of one molecule of galactose and one molecule of fructose.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] Saccharolytic bacteria present in the large intestine subsequently break the substance down into organic acids like lactic acid and small amounts of formic and acetic acids.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] Such resultant volatile fatty acid metabolites, in combination with hydrogen and methane that is also generated consequently enhance intraluminal gas formation, peristaltic gut motility, and elicit an osmotic effect that facilitates an increase in the water content of stool as well as associated stool softening.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] All of these actions ultimately assist in facilitating and increasing the frequency of bowel movements in patients experiencing constipation, although it may take 24 to 48 hours after using the medication for this laxative effect to become evident.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]



At the same time, the formation of such acids via the metabolism of lactulose by colonic bacteria also acidifies the contents of the colon, thereby contributing to the treatment of portal-systemic encephalopathy (PSE).[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] As one of the principal features of PSE involves the accumulation of nitrogenous waste products like ammonia in the systemic circulation, a state in which the colonic contents become more acidic than blood allows ammonia in the circulation to diffuse into the colon.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]. Furthermore, ammonia that diffuses into the acidic colon is ionized to ammonium ions that are incapable of being absorbed back into the blood.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] These effects, combined with the laxative action of lactulose facilitates the excretion of excess ammonia.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] And finally, it is also believed that an acidic colonic environment results in the elimination of urease-producing bacteria that contribute to the formation of ammonia while surviving colonic bacteria use up any trapped ammonia in the colon as a source of nitrogen for protein synthesis.[L6202]', 'Lactulose formulations are most commonly administered via the oral route or the rectal route.[L6202] Consequently, because the substance experiences minimal absorption by the gut it typically remains localized in the gastrointestinal tract environment and ultimately demonstrates almost all of its pharmacologic effects within the gut.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] In particular, as lactulose elicits its laxative effects in enhancing stool amounts and softening stool, such biochemical and physiologic activities can cause increased bowel sounds (borborygmi), a feeling of bloatedness, belching, frequent flatus, and diarrhea.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]   ', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]', 'Pitavastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A181421] Pitavastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which increase hepatic uptake of LDL, thereby reducing circulating LDL-C levels. 



In vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that statins exert vasculoprotective effects independent of their lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] This includes improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response.



Statins have also been found to bind allosterically to β2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and in T cell activation.[A181559]', 'Pitavastatin is an oral antilipemic agent which inhibits HMG-CoA reductase.

High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease.

Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]



**Skeletal Muscle Effects**



Pitavastatin may cause myopathy (muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness with creatine kinase (CK) above ten times the upper limit of normal) and rhabdomyolysis (with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria). Rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis with statin use, including pitavastatin. Predisposing factors for myopathy include advanced age (≥65 years), female gender, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. In most cases, muscle symptoms and CK increases resolved when treatment was promptly discontinued. As dosages of pitavastatin greater than 4mg per day were associated with an increased risk of severe myopathy, the product monograph recommends a maximum daily dose of 4mg once daily.[L48616]



The risk of myopathy during treatment with pitavstatin may be increased with concurrent administration of interacting drugs such as [fenofibrate], [niacin], [gemfibrozil], and [cyclosporine].  Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors coadministered with [colchicine], and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together.[L48616]



Real-world data from observational studies has suggested that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]



**Hepatic Dysfunction**



Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with pitavastatin. In most cases, the elevations were transient and either resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including pitavastatin.[L48616]



Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury.[L48616]

Its role in potentiating insulin signalling cascades has been implicated in several studies. Chromium upregulates insulin-stimulated insulin signal transduction via affecting effector molecules downstream of the insulin receptor (IR). IR-mediated signalling pathway involves phoshorylation of multiple intracellular domains and protein kinases, and downstream effector molecules [A32353]. Upon activation by ligands, intracellular β-subunit of IR autophosphorylates and activates tyrosine kinase domain of the IR, followed by activation and phosphorylation of regulatory proteins and downstream signalling effectors including phosphatidylinositol 2-kinase (PI3K). PI3K activates further downstream reaction cascades to activate protein kinase B (Akt) to ultimately promote translocation of glucose transporter-4 (Glut4)-vesicles from the cytoplasm to the cell surface and regulate glucose uptake [A32353]. Chromium enhances the kinase activity of insulin receptor β and increases the activity of downstream effectors, pI3-kinase and Akt. 



Under insulin-resistant conditions, chromium also promotes GLUT-4 transporter translocation that is independent of activity of IR, IRS-1, PI3-kinase, or Akt; chromium mediates cholesterol efflux from the membranes via increasing fluidity of the membrane by decreasing the membrane cholesterol and upregulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein [A32353]. As a result, intracellular GLUT-4 transporters are stimulated to translocate from intracellular to the plasma membrane, leading to enhanced glucose uptake in muscle cells [L1990]. Chromium attenuates the activity of PTP-1B _in vitro,_ which is a negative regulator of insulin signaling. It also alleviates ER stress that is observed to be elevated the suppression of insulin signaling. ER stress is thought to activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which subsequently induces serine phosphorylation of IRS and aberration of insulin signalling [A32353]. Transient upregulation of AMPK by chromium also leads to increased glucose uptake [A32353]. ', 'Trivalent chromium is part of glucose tolerance factor, an essential activator of insulin-mediated reactions. Chromium helps to maintain normal glucose metabolism and peripheral nerve function. Chromium increases insulin binding to cells, increases insulin receptor density and activates insulin receptor kinase leading to enhanced insulin sensitivity [A32351]. In chromium deficiency, intravenous administration of chromium resulted in normalization of the glucose tolerance curve from the diabetic-like curve typical of chromium deficiency [FDA Label].

1) Secondary prevention of stroke and transient ischemic attacks in patients with rheumatic mitral valve disease but without atrial fibrillation.[A179182]', 'Warfarin is a [vitamin K] antagonist which acts to inhibit the production of vitamin K by vitamin K epoxide reductase.[label,A179221,T116] The reduced form of vitamin K, vitamin KH<sub>2</sub> is a cofactor used in the γ-carboxylation of coagulation factors VII, IX, X, and thrombin. Carboxylation induces a conformational change allowing the factors to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> and to phospholipid surfaces. Uncarboxylated factors VII, IX, X, and thrombin are biologically inactive and therefore serve to interrupt the coagulation cascade. The endogenous anticoagulation proteins C and S also require  γ-carboxylation to function. This is particularly true in the case of thrombin which must be activated in order to form a thrombus. vitamin KH<sub>2</sub> is converted to vitamin K epoxide as part of the γ-carboxylation reaction catalyzed by γ-glutamyl carboxylase. Vitamin K epoxide is then converted to vitamin K<sub>1</sub> by vitamin K epoxide reductase then back to vitamin KH<sub>2</sub> by vitamin K reductase. Warfarin binds to vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 and irreversibly inhibits the enzyme thereby stopping the recycling of vitamin K by preventing the conversion of vitamin K epoxide to vitamin K<sub>1</sub>. This process creates a hypercoagulable state for a short time as proteins C and S degrade first with half lives of 8 and 24 hours, with the exception of factor VII which has a half life of 6 hours.[A179221] Factors IX, X, and finally thrombin degrade later with half lives of 24, 36, and 50 hours resulting in a dominant anticoagulation effect.[A179221] In order to reverse this anticoagulation vitamin K must be supplied, either exogenously or by removal of the vitamin K epoxide reductase inhibition, and time allowed for new coagulation factors to be synthesized.[label,A179221,T116] It takes approximately 2 days for new coagulation factors to be synthesized in the liver. Vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, functionally identical to vitamin K<sub>1</sub>, is synthesized by gut bacteria leading to interactions with antibiotics as elimination of these bacteria can reduce vitamin K<sub>2</sub supply and result in a greater anticoagulation effect.[T116]', 'Warfarin is an anticoagulant, as such it disrupts the coagulation cascade to reduce frequency and extent of thrombus formation.[label,L6616] In patients with deep vein thrombosis or atrial fibrillation there is an increased risk of thrombus formation due to the reduced movement of blood.[T622] For patients with cardiac valve disease or valve replacements this increased coagulability is due to tissue damage. Thrombi due to venous thrombosis can travel to the lungs and become pulmonary emboli, blocking circulation to a portion of lung tissue. Thrombi which form in the heart can travel to the brain and cause ischemic strokes. Prevention of these events is the primary goal of warfarin therapy.



Limitation of thrombus formation is also a source of adverse effects. In patients with atheroscelotic plaques rupture typically results in thrombus formation.[A179212] When these patients are anticoagulated plaque rupture can allow the escape of cholesterol from the lipid core in the form of atheroemboli or cholesterol microemboli. These emboli are smaller than thrombi and block smaller vessels, usually less than 200 μm in diameter. The consequences of this are varied and depend on the location of the blockage. Effects include visual disturbances, acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease, central nervous system ischemia, and purple or blue toe syndrome.[label,A179212] Blue toe syndrome can be reversed if it has not progressed to tissue necrosis but the other effects of microemboli are often permanent.



Antocoagulation appears to mediate warfarin-related nephropathy, a seemingly spontaneous kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease associated with warfarin therapy.[A179215] Nephropathy in this case appears to be due to increased passage of red blood cells through the glomerulus and subsequent blockage of renal tubules with red blood cell casts. This is worsened or possibly triggered by pre-existing kidney damage. Increased risk of warfarin-related nephropathy occurs at INRs over 3.0 but risk does not increase as a function of INR beyond this point.



Warfarin has been linked to the development of calciphylaxis.[label] This is thought to be due to warfarin''s inhibition of [vitamin K](VKA) recycling as VKA is needed for the carboxylation of matrix Gla protein.[A179218] This protein is an anti-calcification factor and its inhibition through preventing the carboxylation step in its production leads to a shift in calcification balance in favor of calciphylaxis. 



Tissue necrosis can occur early on in warfarin therapy.[label] This is attributable to half lives of the clotting factors impacted by inhibition of vitamin K recycling.[label,A179221] Proteins C and S are anticoagulation factors with half lives of 8 and 24 hours respectively. The coagulation factors IX, X, VII, and thrombin (factor II) have half lives of 24, 36, 6, and 50 hours respectively. This means proteins C and S are inactivated sooner than pro-coagulation proteins, with the exception of factor VII, resulting in a pro-thrombotic state for the first few days of therapy. Thrombi which form in this time period can occlude arterioles in various locations, blocking blood flow and causing tissue necrosis due to ischemia.', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Hyaluronic acid works by two basic mechanisms: serving as a passive structural molecule or serving as signaling molecule, depending on the molecule size. The physicochemical properties of high molecular weight HA contribute to passive structural effects, demonstrating hygroscopicity and viscoelasticity and improving hydration, water balance, and structural integrity. As a signalling  molecule interacting with proteins, HA causes several opposing effects based on molecular weight: pro- or anti-inflammatory effects, promotion or inhibition of cell migration, and activating or inhibiting cell division.[A230133] 



Hyaluronic acid exerts its therapeutic effects through binding to three primary types of cell surface receptors: CD44 (a membrane glycoprotein), the receptor for hyaluronate-mediated motility (RHAMM), and the Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1). CD44 is considered the most widely distributed receptor for hyaluronic acid, demonstrating cellular interactions with osteopontin, collagen, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).  High and low molecular weight hyaluronic acids demonstrate differing molecular and cellular mechanisms in their interaction with CD44 receptors. Some examples of these effects include modification of chondrocyte survival pathways in addition to alteration of apoptosis pathways.  Lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor (LYVE-1), and hyaluronic acid receptor for endocytosis (HARE), (also known as Stabilin-2) also bind to hyaluronic acid.[A230128] 



Hyaluronic acid for skin conditions and cosmetics



Hyaluronic acid''s anionic proprieties cause it to attract water and induce swelling, increasing tissue volume and skin structural integrity. The aging process is associated with reduced production of skin hyaluronic acid and collagen, causing the appearance of wrinkles and the loss of facial volume. Dermal fillers of hyaluronic acid replace lost tissue volume, imparting a full and youthful appearance to skin that has lost its elasticity. Hyaluronic acid fillers contain cross-linked hyaluronic acid particles, rendering a concentrated substance with resistance to various forms of physical and chemical breakdown. The cosmetic benefits of hyaluronic acid filler may last up to 6 months, depending on the brand and technique used for injection.[L32193] Additionally, dermal hyaluronic acid fillers are known to increase the production of fibroblasts[L32193], supporting wound healing and offering relief from irritating and inflammatory skin conditions.[A230118]





Hyaluronic acid for joint pain



Most cells in the human body are capable of synthesizing HA. It is a primary component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and can be found in bone marrow, cartilage, and synovial fluid in joints.[A230128] In osteoarthritis, the concentration of naturally occurring hyaluronic acid gradually decreases, lowering the viscosity of synovial fluid that protects joints from excess friction. Administration of intra-articular hyaluronic acid increases viscosity of synovial joint fluid, reducing friction and subsequently relieving painful arthritic symptoms.[L32193]





Hyaluronic acid for ophthalmic conditions and ophthalmological procedures



Solutions of hyaluronic acid with a concentration greater than 0.1% moisturize the surface of the eyes to treat symptoms of dry eye while improving the stabilization of tear film, replenishing deficiencies of HA, reducing friction, and preventing binding of foreign substances to the ocular tissue.[A230128,L32193] Hyaluronic acid is frequently used during and after ophthalmological surgeries and plays important roles by virtue of its moisturizing, viscoelastic, and protective properties. It promotes tissue healing of the corneal epithelium and other parts of the eye following ophthalmological surgery, minimizing the risk of adhesions and free radical formation.[A230128]

', 'HA has long-acting lubricant, shock absorbing, joint stabilizing, and water balancing properties.[A230128,L32193] It is similar to the naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan (GAG) in joints. Hyaluronic acid works by acting as a lubricant and shock absorber, facilitating joint mobility and thereby reducing osteoarthritic pain.  Hyaluronic acid has antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic effects.[A230128] The water-balancing properties and viscoelasticity of hyaluronic acid are beneficial in cosmetic injections, imparting volume and reducing the appearance of imperfections and wrinkles.[L32193] Due to the abovementioned properties, HA has a protective effect on the eyes and cornea.[A230133]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

The retention of phosphate plays a pivotal role in causing secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with osteodystrophy, and soft-tissue calcification. The mechanism by which phosphate retention leads to hyperparathyroidism is not clearly delineated. Therapeutic efforts directed toward the control of hyperphosphatemia include reduction in the dietary intake of phosphate, inhibition of absorption of phosphate in the intestine with phosphate binders, and removal of phosphate from the body by more efficient methods of dialysis. The rate of removal of phosphate by dietary manipulation or by dialysis is insufficient. Dialysis patients absorb 40% to 80% of dietary phosphorus. Therefore, the fraction of dietary phosphate absorbed from the diet needs to be reduced by using phosphate binders in most renal failure patients on maintenance dialysis. Calcium acetate when taken with meals combines with dietary phosphate to form insoluble calcium phosphate which is excreted in the feces. Maintenance of serum phosphorus below 6.0 mg/dl is generally considered as a clinically acceptable outcome of treatment with phosphate binders.

As an active agent indicated for relieving certain cold symptoms and/or certain muscular sprains and cramps, it is believed that eucalyptus oil may possess some antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities.



Some in vitro studies of human blood monocytes suggest a dose-dependent effect of eucalyptus oil to elicit significant inhibition of multiple cytokines, perhaps in the treatment of airway inflammation [A32244, A32245]. Moreover, other studies in animal models discuss the possibility of eucalyptus oil demonstrating anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects that potentially account for inhibiting the formation of prostaglandins and cytokines by stimulated monocytes in vitro [A32246, A32247].

**Metformin extended-release tablet (XR)**



The extended-release formulation of metformin is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Safety in children has not been determined to this date.[L12207]



**Metformin combination products**



Metformin is a component of a variety of combination products with other anti-diabetic agents. It is indicated, along with diet and exercise, to improve glycemic control in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in combination with DPP-4 inhibitors ([sitagliptin], [linagliptin], [alogliptin], or [saxagliptin]),[L11479,L40248,L40253,L40258,L40263] in combination with SGLT2 inhibitors ([canagliflozin], [empagliflozin], [ertugliflozin], or [dapagliflozin]),[L11479,L30503,L1134,L13679,L38729] or in combination with [pioglitazone].[L11419]', 'Metformin''s mechanisms of action are unique from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic drugs. Metformin decreases blood glucose levels by decreasing hepatic glucose production (also called gluconeogenesis), decreasing the intestinal absorption of glucose, and increasing insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.[L12207] It is well established that metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I activity, and it has since been generally postulated that its potent antidiabetic effects occur through this mechanism.[A36534, A36557]   The above processes lead to a decrease in blood glucose, managing type II diabetes and exerting positive effects on glycemic control.



After ingestion, the organic cation transporter-1 (OCT1) is responsible for the uptake of metformin into hepatocytes (liver cells). As this drug is positively charged, it accumulates in cells and in the mitochondria because of the membrane potentials across the plasma membrane as well as the mitochondrial inner membrane. Metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I, preventing the production of mitochondrial ATP leading to increased cytoplasmic ADP:ATP and AMP:ATP ratios.[A36534] These changes activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an enzyme that plays an important role in the regulation of glucose metabolism.[A176348] Aside from this mechanism, AMPK can be activated by a lysosomal mechanism involving other activators.  Following this process, increases in AMP:ATP ratio also inhibit _fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase_ enzyme, resulting in the inhibition of gluconeogenesis, while also inhibiting _adenylate cyclase_ and decreasing the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP),[A36534] a derivative of ATP used for cell signaling [A176351]. Activated AMPK phosphorylates two isoforms of acetyl-CoA carboxylase enzyme, thereby inhibiting fat synthesis and leading to fat oxidation, reducing hepatic lipid stores and increasing liver sensitivity to insulin.[A36534] 



In the intestines, metformin increases anaerobic glucose metabolism in enterocytes (intestinal cells), leading to reduced net glucose uptake and increased delivery of lactate to the liver. Recent studies have also implicated the gut as a primary site of action of metformin and suggest that the liver may not be as important for metformin action in patients with type 2 diabetes. Some of the ways metformin may play a role on the intestines is by promoting the metabolism of glucose by increasing glucagon-like peptide I (GLP-1) as well as increasing gut utilization of glucose.[A36534] 



In addition to the above pathway, the mechanism of action of metformin may be explained by other ways, and its exact mechanism of action has been under extensive study in recent years.[A36535, A36554, A36555, A36557]', '**General effects**



Insulin is an important hormone that regulates blood glucose levels.[T514] Type II diabetes is characterized by a decrease in sensitivity to insulin, resulting in elevations in blood glucose when the pancreas can no longer compensate. In patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, insulin is unable to exert adequate effects on tissues and cells (i.e. insulin resistance)[T514] and insulin deficiency may also be present.[L5753]



Metformin reduces hepatic production of glucose, decreases the intestinal absorption of glucose, and enhances insulin sensitivity by increasing both peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. In contrast with drugs of the sulfonylurea class, which lead to hyperinsulinemia, the secretion of insulin is unchanged with metformin use.[L12207]

Mirtazapine has been used off-label for a variety of conditions including panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, dysthymia, tension headaches, hot flushes, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), sleep disorders, substance abuse disorders, and sexual disorders, among others.[A177811,A177946]', '**Summary**



The mechanism of action of mirtazapine is not fully understood[FDA label] but may be explained by its effects on central adrenergic and serotonergic activity. This drug exhibits a fast onset of action, a high level of response, a manageable side-effect profile, and dual noradrenergic and serotonergic effects that are unique from the effects of other antidepressants.[A177811]



**Effects on various receptors**



It has been shown that both noradrenergic and serotonergic activity increase following mirtazapine administration. The results of these studies demonstrate mirtazapine exerts antagonist activity at presynaptic α2-adrenergic inhibitory autoreceptors and heteroreceptors in the central nervous system. This is thought to lead to enhanced noradrenergic and serotonergic activity [FDA label], which are known to improve the symptoms of depression and form the basis of antidepressant therapy.[A178198, A178201]



Mirtazapine is a strong antagonist of serotonin 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors. It has not been found to bind significantly to the serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors [FDA label] but indirectly increases 5-HT1A transmission.[A4709]  



In addition to the above effects, mirtazapine is a peripheral α1-adrenergic antagonist. This action may explain episodes of orthostatic hypotension that have been reported after mirtazapine use.[FDA label] Mirtazapine is a potent histamine (H1) receptor antagonist, which may contribute to its powerful sedating effects.[FDA label] The pain-relieving effects of mirtazapine may be explained by its effects on opioid receptors.[A13073,A177868]', '**General effects and a note on suicidality**



Mirtazapine is effective in treating moderate to severe depression and treats many symptoms normally associated with this condition. These symptoms may include disturbed sleep, lack of appetite, and anhedonia, in addition to anxiety.[A555,A178150,T595]. It is important to note that suicidal ideation and behavior may emerge or increase during treatment with mirtazapine, as with any other antidepressant. This risk is especially pronounced in younger individuals. Patients, medical professionals, and families should monitor for suicidal thoughts, worsening depression, anxiety, agitation, sleep changes, irritable behavior, aggression, impulsivity, restlessness, and other unusual behavior when this drug is taken or the dose is adjusted.[FDA label] Do not administer mirtazapine to children. When deciding to prescribe this drug, carefully consider the increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior, especially in young adults.[FDA label]



**Effects on appetite and weight gain**



In addition to the above effects, mirtazapine exerts stimulating effects on appetite, and has been used for increasing appetite and decreasing nausea in cancer patients.[A177952, A177958]  Some studies and case reports have shown that this drug improves eating habits and weight gain in patients suffering from anorexia nervosa when administered in conjunction with psychotherapy and/or other psychotropic drugs.[A177961,A178186] In a clinical trial, women with depression experienced a clinically significant mean increase in body weight, fat mass, and concentrations of leptin when treated with mirtazapine for a 6-week period, with a lack of effect on glucose homeostasis.[A177970]



**Effects on sleep**



The use of mirtazapine to treat disordered sleep has been leveraged from its tendency to cause somnolence, which is a frequently experienced adverse effect by patients taking this drug.[A177808,A177994,FDA label] Mirtazapine has been shown to exert beneficial effects on sleep latency, duration, and quality due to its sedating properties.[A177967] Insomnia is a common occurrence in patients with depression, and mirtazapine has been found to be efficacious in treating this condition.[A177808]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

A deficiency in iron indicates that the body cannot produce enough normal red blood cells.[A32514,L11800] Iron deficiency anemia occurs when body stores of iron decrease to very low levels, and the stored iron is insufficient to support normal red blood cell (RBC) production. Insufficient dietary iron, impaired iron absorption, bleeding, pregnancy, or loss of iron through the urine can lead to iron deficiency.[A32514,L11794]  Symptoms of iron deficiency anemia include fatigue, breathlessness, palpitations, dizziness, and headache.



Taking iron in supplement form, such as ferrous sulfate, allows for more rapid increases in iron levels when dietary supply and stores are not sufficient.[L2175] Iron is transported by the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) across the endolysosomal membrane to enter the macrophage. It can then can be incorporated into ferritin and be stored in the macrophage or carried of the macrophage by ferroportin. This exported iron is  oxidized by the enzyme to ceruloplasmin to Fe3+, followed by sequestration by transferrin for transport in the serum to various sites, including the bone marrow for hemoglobin synthesis or into the liver.[A32524] Iron combines with porphyrin and globin chains to form hemoglobin, which is critical for oxygen delivery from the lungs to other tissues.[L2263]', 'Ferrous sulfate replenishes iron, an essential component in hemoglobin, myoglobin, and various enzymes. It replaces the iron that is usually found in hemoglobin and myoglobin.

Sildenafil has a peripheral site of action on erections [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum but potently enhances the relaxant effect of NO on this tissue [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. When the NO/cGMP pathway is activated, as occurs with sexual stimulation, inhibition of PDE5 by sildenafil results in increased corpus cavernosum levels of cGMP [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Therefore sexual stimulation is required in order for sildenafil to produce its intended beneficial pharmacological effects [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].



Moreover, apart from the presence of PDE5 in the corpus cavernosum of the penis, PDE5 is also present in the pulmonary vasculature [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614]. Sildenafil, therefore, increases cGMP within pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells resulting in relaxation [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614]. In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, this can lead to vasodilation of the pulmonary vascular bed and, to a lesser degree, vasodilatation in the systemic circulation [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614].', 'In vitro studies have shown that sildenafil is selective for phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Its effect is more potent on PDE5 than on other known phosphodiesterases [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. In particular, there is a 10-times selectivity over PDE6 which is involved in the phototransduction pathway in the retina [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. There is an 80-times selectivity over PDE1, and over 700-times over PDE 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. And finally, sildenafil has greater than 4,000-times selectivity for PDE5 over PDE3, the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase isoform involved in the control of cardiac contractility [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



In eight double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies of patients with either organic or psychogenic erectile dysfunction, sexual stimulation resulted in improved erections, as assessed by an objective measurement of hardness and duration of erections (via the use of RigiScan®), after sildenafil administration compared with placebo [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Most studies assessed the efficacy of sildenafil approximately 60 minutes post-dose [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The erectile response, as assessed by RigiScan®, generally increased with increasing sildenafil dose and plasma concentration [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The time course of effect was examined in one study, showing an effect for up to 4 hours but the response was diminished compared to 2 hours [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



Sildenafil causes mild and transient decreases in systemic blood pressure which, in the majority of cases, do not translate into clinical effects [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg, three times a day to patients with systemic hypertension the mean change from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was a decrease of 9.4 mmHg and 9.1 mmHg respectively [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg, three times a day to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension lesser effects in blood pressure reduction were observed (a reduction in both systolic and diastolic pressure of 2 mmHg)[F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614] . At the recommended dose of 20 mg three times a day no reductions in systolic or diastolic pressure were seen [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



Single oral doses of sildenafil up to 100 mg in healthy volunteers produced no clinically relevant effects on ECG [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg three times a day to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension no clinically relevant effects on the ECG were reported either [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



In a study of the hemodynamic effects of a single oral 100 mg dose of sildenafil in 14 patients with severe coronary artery disease (CAD) (> 70 % stenosis of at least one coronary artery), the mean resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased by 7 % and 6 % respectively compared to baseline [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Mean pulmonary systolic blood pressure decreased by 9% [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Sildenafil showed no effect on cardiac output and did not impair blood flow through the stenosed coronary arteries [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



Mild and transient differences in color discrimination (blue/green) were detected in some subjects using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test at 1 hour following a 100 mg dose, with no effects evident after 2 hours post-dose [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The postulated mechanism for this change in color discrimination is related to inhibition of PDE6, which is involved in the phototransduction cascade of the retina [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Sildenafil has no effect on visual acuity or contrast sensitivity. In a small size placebo-controlled study of patients with documented early age-related macular degeneration (n = 9), sildenafil (single dose, 100 mg) demonstrated no significant changes in visual tests conducted (which included visual acuity, Amsler grid, color discrimination simulated traffic light, and the Humphrey perimeter and photostress test) [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Although naproxen is an effective analgesic, it can have unintended deleterious effects in the patient. For instance, naproxen can adversely affect blood pressure control.[A179224] A study found that use of naproxen induced an increase in blood pressure, although the increase was not as significant as that found with ibuprofen use.[A179224]



Further, studies have found that the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding is on average four-fold higher for individuals taking NSAIDs.[A179227] Other factors that increase the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding include concurrent use of corticosteroids or anticoagulants, and a history of gastrointestinal ulcers.[A179227]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

**A note on fungal infection prophylaxis**



Patients receiving bone marrow transplantation who are treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy may be predisposed to candida infections, and may receive fluconazole as prophylactic therapy.[L11043]



**A note on laboratory testing**



Obtaining specimens for fungal culture and other important laboratory studies such as serology or pathology is advised before starting fluconazole therapy in order to isolate the organisms to be eliminated through treatment. It is permissible to start therapy before the results are available, however, adjusting the therapy once laboratory results confirm the causative organism may be necessary.[L11043]

', 'Fluconazole is a very selective inhibitor of fungal cytochrome P450 dependent enzyme _lanosterol 14-α-demethylase_. This enzyme normally works to convert _lanosterol_ to _ergosterol_, which is necessary for fungal cell wall synthesis.  The free nitrogen atom located on the azole ring of fluconazole binds with a single iron atom located in the heme group of lanosterol 14-α-demethylase.[A178774] This prevents oxygen activation and, as a result, inhibits the demethylation of lanosterol, halting the process of ergosterol biosynthesis.[A178777]  Methylated sterols are then found to accumulate in the fungal cellular membrane, leading to an arrest of fungal growth.[A178774] These accumulated sterols negatively affect the structure and function of the fungal cell plasma membrane.[A16632]



Fluconazole resistance may arise from an alteration in the amount or function of the target enzyme (lanosterol 14-α-demethylase), altered access to this enzyme, or a combination of the above.[A16632] Other mechanisms may also be implicated, and studies are ongoing.[A178783]', 'Fluconazole has been demonstrated to show fungistatic activity against the majority of strains of the following microorganisms, curing fungal infections[L11043]:



_Candida albicans, Candida glabrata (Many strains are intermediately susceptible), Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, Cryptococcus neoformans_



This is achieved through steroidal inhibition in fungal cells, interfering with cell wall synthesis and growth as well as cell adhesion, thereby treating fungal infections and their symptoms.[L11043,A174325,A174343]



The fungistatic activity of fluconazole has also been shown in normal and immunocompromised animal models with both systemic and intracranial fungal infections caused by _Cryptococcus neoformans_ and for systemic infections caused by Candida albicans.[L11043]  It is important to note that resistant organisms have been found against various strains of organisms treated with fluconazole.[A178759,A178762,A178765] This further substantiates the need to perform susceptibility testing when fluconazole is considered as an antifungal therapy.[A178768,A178786] 





**A note on steroidal effects of fluconazole**



There has been some concern that fluconazole may interfere with and inactivate human steroids/hormones due to the inhibition of hepatic cytochrome enzymes.[L11034]  Fluconazole has demonstrated to be more selective for _fungal_ cytochrome P-450 enzymes than for a variety of mammalian cytochrome P-450 enzymes. Fluconazole 50 mg administered daily for up to 28 days in individuals of reproductive age has been show to have no effect on testosterone plasma concentrations of males and plasma concentrations of steroids in females. A 200-400 mg dose of fluconazole showed no clinically relevant effect on steroid levels or on ACTH-stimulated steroid response in healthy males, in one clinical study mentioned on the European Medicines Agency label.[L11034] Other studies have shown no significant effects of fluconazole on steroid levels, further confirming these data.[A174358,A178780]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Azithromycin binds to the 23S rRNA of the bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit. It stops bacterial protein synthesis by inhibiting the transpeptidation/translocation step of protein synthesis and by inhibiting the assembly of the 50S ribosomal subunit [FDA label], [A14179]. This results in the control of various bacterial infections [A174193], [FDA label].   The strong affinity of macrolides, including azithromycin, for bacterial ribosomes, is consistent with their broad‐spectrum antibacterial activities [A174193].

The effects as they relate to various body systems are described as follows:



**General and cellular actions**



Caffeine exerts several actions on cells, but the clinical relevance is poorly understood. One probable mechanism is the inhibition of nucleotide phosphodiesterase enzymes, adenosine receptors, regulation of calcium handling in cells, and participates in adenosine receptor antagonism.[A187721,L9857] Phosphodiesterase enzymes regulate cell function via actions on second messengers cAMP and cGMP.[A187724] This causes lipolysis through activation of hormone-sensitive lipases, releasing fatty acids and glycerol.[T722]



**Respiratory**



The exact mechanism of action of caffeine in treating apnea related to prematurity is unknown, however, there are several proposed mechanisms, including respiratory center stimulation in the central nervous system, a reduced threshold to hypercapnia with increased response, and increased consumption of oxygen, among others.[L9851] The blocking of the adenosine receptors enhances respiratory drive via an increase in brain medullary response to carbon dioxide, stimulating ventilation and respiratory drive, while increasing contractility of the diaphragm.[T716]



**Central nervous system**



Caffeine demonstrates antagonism of all 4 adenosine receptor subtypes (A1, A2a, A2b, A3) in the central nervous system.[T716,L9851] Caffeine''s effects on alertness and combatting drowsiness are specifically related to the antagonism of the A2a receptor.[T716]



**Renal system**



Caffeine has diuretic effects due to is stimulatory effects on renal blood flow, increase in glomerular filtration, and increase in sodium excretion.[T716]



**Cardiovascular system**



Adenosine receptor antagonism at the A1 receptor by caffeine stimulates inotropic effects in the heart. Blocking of adenosine receptors promotes catecholamine release, leading to stimulatory effects occurring in the heart and the rest of the body.  In the blood vessels, caffeine exerts direct antagonism of adenosine receptors, causing vasodilation. It stimulates the endothelial cells in the blood vessel wall to release nitric oxide, potentiating blood vessel relaxation. Catecholamine release, however, antagonizes this and exerts inotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart, ultimately leading to vasoconstriction. Finally, caffeine is shown to raise systolic blood pressure measurements by 5 to 10 mmHg when it is not taken regularly, versus no effect in those who consume it regularly.[T716] The vasoconstricting effects of caffeine are beneficial in migraines and other types of headache, which are normally caused by vasodilation in the brain.[A187709,L9872]', 'Caffeine stimulates the central nervous system (CNS), heightening alertness, and sometimes causing restlessness and agitation. It relaxes smooth muscle, stimulates the contraction of cardiac muscle, and enhances athletic performance.[A298,T716,L9857] Caffeine promotes gastric acid secretion and increases gastrointestinal motility. It is often combined in products with analgesics and ergot alkaloids, relieving the symptoms of migraine and other types of headaches. Finally, caffeine acts as a mild diuretic.[T716]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

These folic acid congeners are transported across cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis where they are needed to maintain normal erythropoiesis, synthesize purine and thymidylate nucleic acids, interconvert amino acids, methylate tRNA, and generate and use formate. Using vitamin B12 as a cofactor, folic acid can normalize high homocysteine levels by remethylation of homocysteine to methionine via methionine synthetase.', 'Folic acid is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin found in foods such as liver, kidney, yeast, and leafy, green vegetables. Also known as folate or Vitamin B9, folic acid is an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in DNA and RNA synthesis. More specifically, folic acid is required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. Folic acid is the precursor of tetrahydrofolic acid, which is involved as a cofactor for transformylation reactions in the biosynthesis of purines and thymidylates of nucleic acids. Impairment of thymidylate synthesis in patients with folic acid deficiency is thought to account for the defective deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis that leads to megaloblast formation and megaloblastic and macrocytic anemias. Folic acid is particularly important during phases of rapid cell division, such as infancy, pregnancy, and erythropoiesis, and plays a protective factor in the development of cancer. As humans are unable to synthesize folic acid endogenously, diet and supplementation is necessary to prevent deficiencies. In order to function properly within the body, folic acid must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted by anti-metabolite therapies such as [DB00563] as they function as DHFR inhibitors to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, and therefore prevent the formation of DHF and THF.

PPIs such as esomeprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health.

A number of studies have shown that melatonin may be effective for treating sleep-wake cycle disturbances in children and adolescents with mental retardation, autism, and other central nervous system disorders.

', 'Melatonin is a derivative of tryptophan. It binds to melatonin receptor type 1A, which then acts on adenylate cylcase and the inhibition of a cAMP signal transduction pathway. Melatonin not only inhibits adenylate cyclase, but it also activates phosphilpase C. This potentiates the release of arachidonate. By binding to melatonin receptors 1 and 2, the downstream signallling cascades have various effects in the body. The melatonin receptors are G protein-coupled receptors and are expressed in various tissues of the body. There are two subtypes of the receptor in humans, melatonin receptor 1 (MT1) and melatonin receptor 2 (MT2). Melatonin and melatonin receptor agonists, on market or in clinical trials, all bind to and activate both receptor types.The binding of the agonists to the receptors has been investigated for over two decades or since 1986. It is somewhat known, but still not fully understood. When melatonin receptor agonists bind to and activate their receptors it causes numerous physiological processes.

MT1 receptors are expressed in many regions of the central nervous system (CNS): suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SNC), hippocampus, substantia nigra, cerebellum, central dopaminergic pathways, ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens. MT1 is also expressed in the retina, ovary, testis, mammary gland, coronary circulation and aorta, gallbladder, liver, kidney, skin and the immune system. MT2 receptors are expressed mainly in the CNS, also in the lung, cardiac, coronary and aortic tissue, myometrium and granulosa cells, immune cells, duodenum and adipocytes.

The binding of melatonin to melatonin receptors activates a few signaling pathways. MT1 receptor activation inhibits the adenylyl cyclase and its inhibition causes a rippling effect of non activation; starting with decreasing formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and then progressing to less protein kinase A (PKA) activity, which in turn hinders the phosphorilation of cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB binding protein) into P-CREB. MT1 receptors also activate phospholipase C (PLC), affect ion channels and regulate ion flux inside the cell. The binding of melatonin to MT2 receptors inhibits adenylyl cyclase which decreases the formation of cAMP.[4] As well it hinders guanylyl cyclase and therefore the forming of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Binding to MT2 receptors probably affects PLC which increases protein kinase C (PKC) activity. Activation of the receptor can lead to ion flux inside the cell.', 'Melatonin is a hormone normally produced in the pineal gland and released into the blood. The essential amino acid L-tryptophan is a precursor in the synthesis of melatonin. It helps regulate sleep-wake cycles or the circadian rhythm. Production of melatonin is stimulated by darkness and inhibited by light. High levels of melatonin induce sleep and so consumption of the drug can be used to combat insomnia and jet lag.

MT1 and MT2 receptors may be a target for the treatment of circadian and non circadian sleep disorders because of their differences in pharmacology and function within the SCN. SCN is responsible for maintaining the 24 hour cycle which regulates many different body functions ranging from sleep to immune functions

Moreover, the EPA and DHA acids are also believed to be able to promote apolipoprotein B degradation in the liver through the stimulation of an autophagic process [A32933]. It may also be possible that these fish oil acids can accelerate the clearance of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles and chylomicron [A32933]. The combination of all these actions results in fewer VLDL particles being assembled and secreted, which is of considerable importance as VLDL particles are the major endogenous source of triglycerides [A32933].

• Treatment of active duodenal ulcer in adults 



• Eradication of Helicobacter pylori to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer

recurrence in adults 



• Treatment of active benign gastric ulcer in adults 



• Reduction of risk of upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in critically ill adult patients.



• Treatment of symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in

patients 1 year of age and older 



• Treatment of erosive esophagitis (EE) due to acid-mediated GERD in

patients 1 month of age and older 



• Maintenance of healing of EE due to acid-mediated GERD in patients 1

year of age and older 



• Pathologic hypersecretory conditions in adults', 'Hydrochloric acid (HCl) secretion into the gastric lumen is a process regulated mainly by the H(+)/K(+)-ATPase of the proton pump [A175180], expressed in high quantities by the parietal cells of the stomach. ATPase is an enzyme on the parietal cell membrane that facilitates hydrogen and potassium exchange through the cell, which normally results in the extrusion of potassium and formation of HCl (gastric acid) [A174295].



Omeprazole is a member of a class of antisecretory compounds, the substituted _benzimidazoles_, that stop gastric acid secretion by selective inhibition of the _H+/K+ ATPase_ enzyme system. Proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole bind covalently to cysteine residues via disulfide bridges on the alpha subunit of the _H+/K+ ATPase_ pump, inhibiting gastric acid secretion for up to 36 hours [A175192].  This antisecretory effect is dose-related and leads to the inhibition of both basal and stimulated acid secretion, regardless of the stimulus [FDA label].  



**Mechanism of H. pylori eradication**



Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is frequently associated with _Helicobacter pylori_ bacterial infection (NSAIDs) [A175195]. The treatment of H. pylori infection may include the addition of omeprazole or other proton pump inhibitors as part of the treatment regimen [FDA label], [A175198]. 

_H. pylori_ replicates most effectively at a neutral pH [A175213]. Acid inhibition in H. pylori eradication therapy, including proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole, raises gastric pH, discouraging the growth of H.pylori [A175198]. It is generally believed that proton pump inhibitors inhibit the _urease_ enzyme, which increases the pathogenesis of H. pylori in gastric-acid related conditions [A175216].   ', '**Effects on gastric acid secretion**



This drug decreases gastric acid secretion [FDA label]. After oral administration, the onset of the antisecretory effect of omeprazole is usually achieved within one hour, with the maximum effect occurring by 2 hours after administration. The inhibitory effect of omeprazole on acid secretion increases with repeated once-daily dosing, reaching a plateau after four days [FDA label].



**Effects on serum gastrin**



In studies of 200 or more patients, serum gastrin levels increased during the first 1-2 weeks of daily administration of therapeutic doses of omeprazole. This occurred in a parallel fashion with the inhibition of acid secretion. No further increase in serum gastrin occurred with continued omeprazole administration. Increased gastrin causes enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and increased serum Chromogranin A (CgA) levels. The increased CgA levels may lead to false positive results in diagnostic studies for neuroendocrine tumors [FDA label].



**Enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell effects**



Human gastric biopsy samples have been obtained from more than 3000 pediatric and adult patients treated with omeprazole in long-term clinical studies. The incidence of enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia in these studies increased with time; however, no case of ECL cell carcinoids, dysplasia, or neoplasia have been identified in these patients. These studies, however, are of insufficient in power and duration to draw conclusions on the possible influence of long-term administration of omeprazole in the development of any premalignant or malignant conditions [FDA label]. 



**Other effects**



Systemic effects of omeprazole in the central nervous system, cardiovascular and respiratory systems have not been found to date. Omeprazole, given in oral doses of 30 or 40 mg for 2-4 weeks, showed no effect on thyroid function, carbohydrate metabolism, or circulating levels of parathyroid hormone, cortisol, estradiol, testosterone, prolactin, cholecystokinin or secretin [FDA label].

Hydrocarbons are capable of partitioning into the cell and cytoplasmic membrane of microorganisms and disrupt their vital functions, which may result in leakage of ions such as potassium, and the inhibition of respiration [A32439]. Eventually, cell lysis may occur due to weakening of the cell wall, and loss of turgor pressure and subsequent rupture of the cytoplasmic membrane [A32441]. The loss of 260-nm-absorbing material may be indicative of a damaged cytoplasmic membrane and loss of nucleic acids [A32441]. In _E. coli_, perturbed potassium homeostasis, glucose-dependent respiration, cell morphology, and ability to exclude propidium iodide was observed. 



Tea tree oil also mediates its antifungal actions in a similar way, where it alters the permeability of Candida albicans and inhibits its respiration in a dose-dependent manner [A32439]. Plasma and mitochondrial membranes of fungal species are also thought to be negatively affected by inhibition of glucose-induced medium acidification by tea tree oil, which involves inhibition of membrane ATPase responsible for the expulsion of protons [A32439]. Tea tree oil also inhibits the formation of germ tubes, or mycelial conversion, in _C. albicans_, thereby disrupting cell morphogenesis [A32439]. Water-soluble fraction of TTO, terpinen-4-ol, and α-terpineol, can inhibit the lipopolysaccharide-induced production of the inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-10 by human peripheral monocytes by approximately 50% and that of prostaglandin E2 by about 30% after 40 h [A32439].

After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Specifically glucocorticoids induce lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis, which then binds to cell membranes preventing the phospholipase A2 from coming into contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to diminished eicosanoid production. The cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) expression is also suppressed, potentiating the effect. In other words, the two main products in inflammation Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes are inhibited by the action of Glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids also stimulate the lipocortin-1 escaping to the extracellular space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits various inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines etc.) from neutrophils, macrophages and mastocytes. Additionally the immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding.', 'Hydrocortisone is the most important human glucocorticoid. It is essential for life and regulates or supports a variety of important cardiovascular, metabolic, immunologic and homeostatic functions. Topical hydrocortisone is used for its anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive properties to treat inflammation due to corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. Glucocorticoids are a class of steroid hormones characterised by an ability to bind with the cortisol receptor and trigger a variety of important cardiovascular, metabolic, immunologic and homeostatic effects. Glucocorticoids are distinguished from mineralocorticoids and sex steroids by having different receptors, target cells, and effects. Technically, the term corticosteroid refers to both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, but is often used as a synonym for glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoids suppress cell-mediated immunity. They act by inhibiting genes that code for the cytokines IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha, the most important of which is the IL-2. Reduced cytokine production limits T cell proliferation. Glucocorticoids also suppress humoral immunity, causing B cells to express lower amounts of IL-2 and IL-2 receptors. This diminishes both B cell clonal expansion and antibody synthesis. The diminished amounts of IL-2 also leads to fewer T lymphocyte cells being activated.', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

For adult patients who have not healed after 8 weeks of treatment, an additional 8-week course of pantoprazole may be considered. Safety of treatment beyond 8 weeks in pediatric patients has not been determined.[F3202]



**Maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis**



Indicated for maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis and reduction in relapse rates of daytime and nighttime heartburn symptoms in adult patients with GERD.[F3202]



**Pathological hypersecretory conditions including Zollinger-Ellison syndrome**



Indicated for the long-term treatment of the above conditions.[F3202]', 'Hydrochloric acid (HCl) secretion into the gastric lumen is a process regulated mainly by the H(+)/K(+)-ATPase of the proton pump, expressed in high quantities by the parietal cells of the stomach.[A174295] ATPase is an enzyme on the parietal cell membrane that facilitates hydrogen and potassium exchange through the cell, which normally results in the extrusion of potassium and formation of HCl (gastric acid). 



Proton pump inhibitors such as pantoprazole are substituted _benzimidazole_ derivatives, weak bases, which accumulate in the acidic space of the parietal cell before being converted in the _canaliculi_  (small canal) of the gastric parietal cell, an acidic environment, to active _sulfenamide_ derivatives. This active form then makes disulfide bonds with important cysteines on the gastric acid pump, inhibiting its function.[A174247] Specifically, pantoprazole binds to the _sulfhydryl group_ of H+, K+-ATPase, which is an enzyme implicated in accelerating the final step in the acid secretion pathway. The enzyme is inactivated, inhibiting gastric acid secretion.[A174253] The inhibition of gastric acid secretion is stronger with proton pump inhibitors such as pantoprazole and lasts longer than with the H(2) antagonists.[A174295] ', 'This drug acts to decrease gastric acid secretion, which reduces stomach acidity. Pantoprazole administration leads to long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion.[F3193]



**General Effects**



Pantoprazole has been shown to reduce acid reflux-related symptoms, heal inflammation of the esophagus, and improve patient quality of life more effectively than histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2 blockers). This drug has an excellent safety profile and a low incidence of drug interactions. It can be used safely in various high-risk patient populations, including the elderly and those with renal failure or moderate hepatic dysfunction.[A174226]



Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as pantoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]



PPIs such as pantoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes [A177577, A177580]. 



**A note on laboratory testing abnormalities**



During treatment with antisecretory medicinal products such as pantoprazole, serum gastrin (a peptide hormone that stimulates secretion of gastric acid) increases in response to the decreased acid secretion caused by proton pump inhibition. The increased gastrin level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Published evidence suggests that proton pump inhibitors should be stopped 14 days before chromogranin A (CgA) measurements. This permits chromogranin A levels, that might be falsely elevated after proton pump inhibitor treatment, to return to the normal reference range.[F3217]

These folic acid congeners are transported across cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis where they are needed to maintain normal erythropoiesis, synthesize purine and thymidylate nucleic acids, interconvert amino acids, methylate tRNA, and generate and use formate. Using vitamin B12 as a cofactor, folic acid can normalize high homocysteine levels by remethylation of homocysteine to methionine via methionine synthetase.', 'Folic acid is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin found in foods such as liver, kidney, yeast, and leafy, green vegetables. Also known as folate or Vitamin B9, folic acid is an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in DNA and RNA synthesis. More specifically, folic acid is required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. Folic acid is the precursor of tetrahydrofolic acid, which is involved as a cofactor for transformylation reactions in the biosynthesis of purines and thymidylates of nucleic acids. Impairment of thymidylate synthesis in patients with folic acid deficiency is thought to account for the defective deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis that leads to megaloblast formation and megaloblastic and macrocytic anemias. Folic acid is particularly important during phases of rapid cell division, such as infancy, pregnancy, and erythropoiesis, and plays a protective factor in the development of cancer. As humans are unable to synthesize folic acid endogenously, diet and supplementation is necessary to prevent deficiencies. In order to function properly within the body, folic acid must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted by anti-metabolite therapies such as [DB00563] as they function as DHFR inhibitors to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, and therefore prevent the formation of DHF and THF.

* Investigational uses - efforts have been put into developing ibuprofen for the prophylaxis of Alzheimer''s disease, Parkinson disease, and breast cancer.[A39092]', 'The exact mechanism of action of ibuprofen is unknown. However, ibuprofen is considered an NSAID and thus it is a non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, which is an enzyme involved in prostaglandin (mediators of pain and fever) and thromboxane (stimulators of blood clotting) synthesis via the arachidonic acid pathway.[L4614]



Ibuprofen is a non-selective COX inhibitor and hence, it inhibits the activity of both COX-1 and COX-2. The inhibition of COX-2 activity decreases the synthesis of prostaglandins involved in mediating inflammation, pain, fever, and swelling while the inhibition of COX-1 is thought to cause some of the side effects of ibuprofen including GI ulceration.[A39195]', 'Ibuprofen has multiple actions in different inflammatory pathways involved in acute and chronic inflammation. The main effects reported in ibuprofen are related to the control of pain, fever and acute inflammation by the inhibition of the synthesis of prostanoids by COX-1 and COX-2. Pain relief is attributed to peripheral affected regions and central nervous system effects in the pain transmission mediated by the dorsal horn and higher spinothalamic tract. Some reports have tried to link the pain regulation with a possible enhancement on the synthesis of endogenous cannabinoids and action on the NMDA receptors. The effect on pain has been shown to be related to the cortically evoked potentials.[A39190]



The antipyretic effect is reported to be linked to the effect on the prostanoid synthesis due to the fact that the prostanoids are the main signaling mediator of pyresis in the hypothalamic-preoptic region.[A39190]



The use of ibuprofen in dental procedures is attributed to the local inhibition of prostanoid production as well as to anti-oedemic activity and an increase of plasma beta-endorphins. Some reports have suggested a rapid local reduction of the expression of COX-2 in dental pulp derived by the administration of ibuprofen.[A39190]



The administration of ibuprofen in patients with rheumatic diseases has shown to control joint symptoms.[A39092] 



Ibuprofen is largely used in OTC products such as an agent for the management of dysmenorrhea which has been proven to reduce the amount of menstrual prostanoids and to produce a reduction in the uterine hypercontractility.[A39181] As well, it has been reported to reduce significantly the fever and the pain caused by migraines.[A39182, A39183] This effect is thought to be related to the effect on platelet activation and thromboxane A2 production which produces local vascular effects in the affected regions. This effect is viable as ibuprofen can enter in the central nervous system.[A39190]



In the investigational uses of ibuprofen, it has been reported to reduce neurodegeneration when given in low doses over a long time.[A39184] On the other hand, its use in Parkinson disease is related to the importance of inflammation and oxidative stress in the pathology of this condition.[A39185] The use of ibuprofen for breast cancer is related to a study that shows a decrease of 50% in the rate of breast cancer.[A39186]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

', 'Indapamide acts on the nephron, specifically at the proximal segment of the distal convoluted tubule where it inhibits the Na+/Cl- cotransporter, leading to reduced sodium reabsorption.[A203519,A16729] As a result, sodium and water are retained in the lumen of the nephron for urinary excretion.[A185180] The effects that follow include reduced plasma volume, reduced venous return, lower cardiac output, and ultimately decreased blood pressure.[A16729]



Interestingly, it is likely that thiazide-like diuretics such as indapamide have additional blood pressure lowering mechanisms that are unrelated to diuresis.[A16729] This is exemplified by the observation that the antihypertensive effects of thiazides are sustained 4-6 weeks after initiation of therapy, despite recovering plasma and extracellular fluid volumes.[A16729] 



Some studies have suggested that indapamide may decrease responsiveness to pressor agents while others have suggested it can decrease peripheral resistance.[A203627] Although it is clear that diuresis contributes to the antihypertensive effects of indapamide, further studies are needed to investigate the medication’s ability to decrease peripheral vascular resistance and relax vascular smooth muscle.[A203627]', 'Classified as a sulfonamide diuretic, indapamide is an effective antihypertensive agent and by extension, has shown efficacy in the prevention of target organ damage.[A203627,A203660]

Administration of indapamide produces water and electrolyte loss, with higher doses associated with increased diuresis.[A203627,A204068] Severe and clinically significant electrolyte disturbances may occur with indapamide use - for example, hypokalemia resulting from renal potassium loss may lead to QTc prolongation.[A203627,A204062] Further electrolyte imbalances may occur due to renal excretion of sodium, chloride, and magnesium.[A203627,A204062,A204068] 



Other indapamide induced changes include increases in plasma renin and aldosterone, and reduced calcium excretion in the urine.[A203627,A204074,A204131] In many studies investigating the effects of indapamide in both non-diabetic and diabetic hypertensive patients, glucose tolerance was not significantly altered.[A203627] However, additional studies are necessary to assess the long term metabolic impacts of indapamide, since thiazide related impaired glucose tolerance can take several years to develop in non-diabetic patients.[A203627]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

PGE<sub>2</sub> is the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.[A179023] It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.[T116,A179023] PGE<sub>2</sub> activates the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled EP<sub>1</sub> receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE<sub>2</sub> also activates the EP<sub>4</sub> receptor, coupled to G<sub>s</sub>, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE<sub>2</sub> act via EP<sub>3</sub> to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP<sub>2</sub> to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI<sub>2</sub> is known to play a role via its G<sub>s</sub>-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.



PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP<sub>2</sub> receptors.[T116,A179044] Similarly to β adrenergic receptors these are G<sub>s</sub>-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE<sub>2</sub> also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.[T116] PGD<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP<sub>1</sub> receptor.[A179044] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.



PGE<sub>2</sub> can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory G<sub>q</sub> EP<sub>3</sub> receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.[T116] This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever. NSAIDs prevent the generation of PGE<sub>2</sub> thereby reducing the activity of these neurons.

A deficiency in iron indicates that the body cannot produce enough normal red blood cells.[A32514,L11800] Iron deficiency anemia occurs when body stores of iron decrease to very low levels, and the stored iron is insufficient to support normal red blood cell (RBC) production. Insufficient dietary iron, impaired iron absorption, bleeding, pregnancy, or loss of iron through the urine can lead to iron deficiency.[A32514,L11794]  Symptoms of iron deficiency anemia include fatigue, breathlessness, palpitations, dizziness, and headache.



Taking iron in supplement form, such as ferrous sulfate, allows for more rapid increases in iron levels when dietary supply and stores are not sufficient.[L2175] Iron is transported by the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) across the endolysosomal membrane to enter the macrophage. It can then can be incorporated into ferritin and be stored in the macrophage or carried of the macrophage by ferroportin. This exported iron is  oxidized by the enzyme to ceruloplasmin to Fe3+, followed by sequestration by transferrin for transport in the serum to various sites, including the bone marrow for hemoglobin synthesis or into the liver.[A32524] Iron combines with porphyrin and globin chains to form hemoglobin, which is critical for oxygen delivery from the lungs to other tissues.[L2263]', 'Ferrous sulfate replenishes iron, an essential component in hemoglobin, myoglobin, and various enzymes.

The effects as they relate to various body systems are described as follows:



**General and cellular actions**



Caffeine exerts several actions on cells, but the clinical relevance is poorly understood. One probable mechanism is the inhibition of nucleotide phosphodiesterase enzymes, adenosine receptors, regulation of calcium handling in cells, and participates in adenosine receptor antagonism.[A187721,L9857] Phosphodiesterase enzymes regulate cell function via actions on second messengers cAMP and cGMP.[A187724] This causes lipolysis through activation of hormone-sensitive lipases, releasing fatty acids and glycerol.[T722]



**Respiratory**



The exact mechanism of action of caffeine in treating apnea related to prematurity is unknown, however, there are several proposed mechanisms, including respiratory center stimulation in the central nervous system, a reduced threshold to hypercapnia with increased response, and increased consumption of oxygen, among others.[L9851] The blocking of the adenosine receptors enhances respiratory drive via an increase in brain medullary response to carbon dioxide, stimulating ventilation and respiratory drive, while increasing contractility of the diaphragm.[T716]



**Central nervous system**



Caffeine demonstrates antagonism of all 4 adenosine receptor subtypes (A1, A2a, A2b, A3) in the central nervous system.[T716,L9851] Caffeine''s effects on alertness and combatting drowsiness are specifically related to the antagonism of the A2a receptor.[T716]



**Renal system**



Caffeine has diuretic effects due to is stimulatory effects on renal blood flow, increase in glomerular filtration, and increase in sodium excretion.[T716]



**Cardiovascular system**



Adenosine receptor antagonism at the A1 receptor by caffeine stimulates inotropic effects in the heart. Blocking of adenosine receptors promotes catecholamine release, leading to stimulatory effects occurring in the heart and the rest of the body.  In the blood vessels, caffeine exerts direct antagonism of adenosine receptors, causing vasodilation. It stimulates the endothelial cells in the blood vessel wall to release nitric oxide, potentiating blood vessel relaxation. Catecholamine release, however, antagonizes this and exerts inotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart, ultimately leading to vasoconstriction. Finally, caffeine is shown to raise systolic blood pressure measurements by 5 to 10 mmHg when it is not taken regularly, versus no effect in those who consume it regularly.[T716] The vasoconstricting effects of caffeine are beneficial in migraines and other types of headache, which are normally caused by vasodilation in the brain.[A187709,L9872]', 'Caffeine stimulates the central nervous system (CNS), heightening alertness, and sometimes causing restlessness and agitation. It relaxes smooth muscle, stimulates the contraction of cardiac muscle, and enhances athletic performance.[A298,T716,L9857] Caffeine promotes gastric acid secretion and increases gastrointestinal motility. It is often combined in products with analgesics and ergot alkaloids, relieving the symptoms of migraine and other types of headaches.

Finasteride is also indicated for the treatment of male pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia, hereditary alopecia, or common male baldness) in male patients.[L6235]', 'Finasteride acts as a competitive and specific inhibitor of Type II 5α-reductase, a nuclear-bound steroid intracellular enzyme primarily located in the prostatic stromal cell that converts the androgen testosterone into the more active metabolite, 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT).[A2132] DHT is considered to be the primary androgen playing a role in the development and enlargement of the prostate gland. It serves as the hormonal mediator for the hyperplasia upon accumulation within the prostate gland.[A178270] DHT displays a higher affinity towards androgen receptors in the prostate gland compared to testosterone[T28] and by acting on the androgen receptors, DHT modulates genes that are responsible for cell proliferation.[A178279] Responsible for the production of DHT together with type I 5α-reductase, the type II 5α-reductase isozyme is primarily found in the prostate, seminal vesicles, epididymides, and hair follicles as well as liver.[L6235] Although finasteride is 100-fold more selective for type II 5α-reductase than for the type I isoenzyme,[A178183] chronic treatment with this drug may have some effect on type I 5α-reductase, which is predominantly expressed in sebaceous glands of most regions of skin, including the scalp, and liver. It is proposed that the type I 5α-reductase and type II 5α-reductase is responsible for the production of one-third and two-thirds of circulating DHT, respectively. 



The mechanism of action of Finasteride is based on its preferential inhibition of Type II 5α-reductase through the formation of a stable complex with the enzyme _in vitro_ and _in vivo_.[L10565] Finasteride works selectively, where it preferentially displays a 100-fold selectivity for the human Type II 5α-reductase over type I enzyme.[L6235] Inhibition of Type II 5α-reductase blocks the peripheral conversion of testosterone to DHT, resulting in significant decreases in serum and tissue DHT concentrations, minimal to moderate increase in serum testosterone concentrations, and substantial increases in prostatic testosterone concentrations. As DHT appears to be the principal androgen responsible for stimulation of prostatic growth, a decrease in DHT concentrations will result in a decrease in prostatic volume (approximately 20-30% after 6-24 months of continued therapy). It is suggested that increased levels of DHT can lead to potentiated transcription of prostaglandin D2, which promotes the proliferation of prostate cancer cells.[A178189] In men with androgenic alopecia, the mechanism of action has not been fully determined, but finasteride has shown to decrease scalp DHT concentration to the levels found in the hairy scalp, reduce serum DHT, increase hair regrowth, and slow hair loss. Another study suggests that finasteride may work to reduce bleeding of prostatic origin by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the prostate, leading to atrophy and programmed cell death.[A178183] This may bestow the drug therapeutic benefits in patients idiopathic prostatic bleeding, bleeding during anticoagulation, or bleeding after instrumentation.[A178183]', 'Finasteride is an antiandrogenic compound that works by suppressing the production of serum and intraprostatic dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in men via inhibiting the enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of DHT. The maximum effect of a rapid reduction in serum DHT concentration is expected to be observed 8 hours following administration of the first dose.[L10565] In a single man receiving a single oral dose of 5 mg finasteride for up to 4 years, there was a reduction in the serum DHT concentrations by approximately 70% and the median circulating level of testosterone increased by approximately 10-20% within the physiologic range. [L10565] In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, finasteride reduced intraprostatic DHT level by 91.4% but finasteride is not expected to decrease the DHT levels to castrate levels since circulating testosterone is also converted to DHT by the type 1 isoenzyme expressed in other tissues.[A2132] It is expected that DHT levels return to normal within 14 days upon discontinuation of the drug.[L6244] In a study of male patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia prior to prostatectomy, the treatment with finasteride resulted in an approximate 80% lower DHT content was measured in prostatic tissue removed at surgery compared to placebo.[L10565] While finasteride reduces the size of the prostate gland by 20%, this may not correlate well with improvement in symptoms.[A178273] The effects of finasteride are reported to be more pronounced in male patients with enlarged prostates (>25 mL) who are at the greatest risk of disease progression.[A2132]



In phase III clinical studies, oral administration of finasteride in male patients with male pattern hair loss promoted hair growth and prevented further hair loss by 66% and 83% of the subjects, respectively, which lasted during two years'' treatment.[A178222] The incidences of these effects in treatment groups were significantly higher than that of the group receiving a placebo.[A178222] Following finasteride administration, the levels of DHT in the scalp skin was shown to be reduced by more than 60%, indicating that the DHT found in scalp is derived from both local DHT production and circulating DHT.[A178195] The effect of finasteride on scalp DHT is likely seen because of its effect on both local follicular DHT levels as well as serum DHT levels.[A178195]. There is evidence from early clinical observations and controlled studies that finasteride may reduce bleeding of prostatic origin.[A178183]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

DNA gyrase is an enzyme found only in bacteria that introduces negative supercoils into DNA during replication - this helps to relieve torsional strain caused by the introduction of positive supercoils during replication, and these negative supercoils are essential for chromosome condensation and the promotion of transcription initiation.[A31453] It is comprised of four subunits (two A subunits and two B subunits) of which the A subunits appear to be the target of fluoroquinolone antibiotics.[A190663] Bacterial topoisomerase IV, in addition to contributing to the relaxation of positive supercoils, is essential at the terminal stages of DNA replication and functions to “unlink” newly replicated chromosomes to allow for the completion of cell division.[A31453]

These folic acid congeners are transported across cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis where they are needed to maintain normal erythropoiesis, synthesize purine and thymidylate nucleic acids, interconvert amino acids, methylate tRNA, and generate and use formate. Using vitamin B12 as a cofactor, folic acid can normalize high homocysteine levels by remethylation of homocysteine to methionine via methionine synthetase.', 'Folic acid is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin found in foods such as liver, kidney, yeast, and leafy, green vegetables. Also known as folate or Vitamin B9, folic acid is an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in DNA and RNA synthesis. More specifically, folic acid is required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. Folic acid is the precursor of tetrahydrofolic acid, which is involved as a cofactor for transformylation reactions in the biosynthesis of purines and thymidylates of nucleic acids. Impairment of thymidylate synthesis in patients with folic acid deficiency is thought to account for the defective deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis that leads to megaloblast formation and megaloblastic and macrocytic anemias. Folic acid is particularly important during phases of rapid cell division, such as infancy, pregnancy, and erythropoiesis, and plays a protective factor in the development of cancer. As humans are unable to synthesize folic acid endogenously, diet and supplementation is necessary to prevent deficiencies. In order to function properly within the body, folic acid must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted by anti-metabolite therapies such as [DB00563] as they function as DHFR inhibitors to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, and therefore prevent the formation of DHF and THF.

In the treatment of head lice dimethicone 100, the respiratory systems of head lice are targeted.  NYDA works by suffocating the lice, nymphs and the embryos. The physical properties of this drug, including the viscosity and spreading property of the solution allow it to easily flow into the respiratory system of all developmental stages of the insect,  causing suffocation and death of the organisms. It diffuses through the stigmata (spiracles) of the lice, into the tracheae of the head lice as well as through the aeropyles of the egg operculum. The solution then displaces oxygen. The low viscosity, volatile dimethicone enables the NYDA head lice solution to penetrate into the breathing system. Its evaporation causes the thickening of the NYDA solution. The remaining high viscosity dimethicone ultimately encloses the respiratory system and thus leading to suffocation of all stages of head lice (adult lice, larvae and eggs). This mode of action prevents the development of lice resistance by preventing the formation of new progency [L1774].



Studies performed using house crickets and lice suggest a close correlation between the death of the lice and the influx of the solution into the insect head tracheae. These data strongly suggest that the total filling of the head tracheae immediately blocks the oxygen supply to the insect central nervous system. Death, following numerous stages of disability after the entrance of dimethicones into the abdominal tracheal system, demonstrates the sequence of oxygen deprivation.

Hyaluronic acid works by two basic mechanisms: serving as a passive structural molecule or serving as signaling molecule, depending on the molecule size. The physicochemical properties of high molecular weight HA contribute to passive structural effects, demonstrating hygroscopicity and viscoelasticity and improving hydration, water balance, and structural integrity. As a signalling  molecule interacting with proteins, HA causes several opposing effects based on molecular weight: pro- or anti-inflammatory effects, promotion or inhibition of cell migration, and activating or inhibiting cell division.[A230133] 



Hyaluronic acid exerts its therapeutic effects through binding to three primary types of cell surface receptors: CD44 (a membrane glycoprotein), the receptor for hyaluronate-mediated motility (RHAMM), and the Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1). CD44 is considered the most widely distributed receptor for hyaluronic acid, demonstrating cellular interactions with osteopontin, collagen, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).  High and low molecular weight hyaluronic acids demonstrate differing molecular and cellular mechanisms in their interaction with CD44 receptors. Some examples of these effects include modification of chondrocyte survival pathways in addition to alteration of apoptosis pathways.  Lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor (LYVE-1), and hyaluronic acid receptor for endocytosis (HARE), (also known as Stabilin-2) also bind to hyaluronic acid.[A230128] 



Hyaluronic acid for skin conditions and cosmetics



Hyaluronic acid''s anionic proprieties cause it to attract water and induce swelling, increasing tissue volume and skin structural integrity. The aging process is associated with reduced production of skin hyaluronic acid and collagen, causing the appearance of wrinkles and the loss of facial volume. Dermal fillers of hyaluronic acid replace lost tissue volume, imparting a full and youthful appearance to skin that has lost its elasticity. Hyaluronic acid fillers contain cross-linked hyaluronic acid particles, rendering a concentrated substance with resistance to various forms of physical and chemical breakdown. The cosmetic benefits of hyaluronic acid filler may last up to 6 months, depending on the brand and technique used for injection.[L32193] Additionally, dermal hyaluronic acid fillers are known to increase the production of fibroblasts[L32193], supporting wound healing and offering relief from irritating and inflammatory skin conditions.[A230118]





Hyaluronic acid for joint pain



Most cells in the human body are capable of synthesizing HA. It is a primary component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and can be found in bone marrow, cartilage, and synovial fluid in joints.[A230128] In osteoarthritis, the concentration of naturally occurring hyaluronic acid gradually decreases, lowering the viscosity of synovial fluid that protects joints from excess friction. Administration of intra-articular hyaluronic acid increases viscosity of synovial joint fluid, reducing friction and subsequently relieving painful arthritic symptoms.[L32193]





Hyaluronic acid for ophthalmic conditions and ophthalmological procedures



Solutions of hyaluronic acid with a concentration greater than 0.1% moisturize the surface of the eyes to treat symptoms of dry eye while improving the stabilization of tear film, replenishing deficiencies of HA, reducing friction, and preventing binding of foreign substances to the ocular tissue.[A230128,L32193] Hyaluronic acid is frequently used during and after ophthalmological surgeries and plays important roles by virtue of its moisturizing, viscoelastic, and protective properties. It promotes tissue healing of the corneal epithelium and other parts of the eye following ophthalmological surgery, minimizing the risk of adhesions and free radical formation.[A230128]

', 'HA has long-acting lubricant, shock absorbing, joint stabilizing, and water balancing properties.[A230128,L32193] It is similar to the naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan (GAG) in joints. Hyaluronic acid works by acting as a lubricant and shock absorber, facilitating joint mobility and thereby reducing osteoarthritic pain.  Hyaluronic acid has antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic effects.[A230128] The water-balancing properties and viscoelasticity of hyaluronic acid are beneficial in cosmetic injections, imparting volume and reducing the appearance of imperfections and wrinkles.[L32193] Due to the abovementioned properties, HA has a protective effect on the eyes and cornea.[A230133]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

They work by binding with the phosphate in the food you eat, so that it is eliminated from the body without being absorbed.', 'Patients with advanced renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min) exhibit phosphate retention and some degree of hyperphosphatemia. The retention of phosphate plays a pivotal role in causing secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with osteodystrophy, and soft-tissue calcification. The mechanism by which phosphate retention leads to hyperparathyroidism is not clearly delineated. Therapeutic efforts directed toward the control of hyperphosphatemia include reduction in the dietary intake of phosphate, inhibition of absorption of phosphate in the intestine with phosphate binders, and removal of phosphate from the body by more efficient methods of dialysis. The rate of removal of phosphate by dietary manipulation or by dialysis is insufficient. Dialysis patients absorb 40% to 80% of dietary phosphorus. Therefore, the fraction of dietary phosphate absorbed from the diet needs to be reduced by using phosphate binders in most renal failure patients on maintenance dialysis. Calcium acetate when taken with meals combines with dietary phosphate to form insoluble calcium phosphate which is excreted in the feces. Maintenance of serum phosphorus below 6.0 mg/dl is generally considered as a clinically acceptable outcome of treatment with phosphate binders. Calcium acetate is highly soluble at neutral pH, making the calcium readily available for binding to phosphate in the proximal small intestine.', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);
