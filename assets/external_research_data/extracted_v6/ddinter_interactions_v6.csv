DDInter20,Acetylsalicylic acid,DDInter900,Ibuprofen,Moderate,Antagonism,"The antiplatelet and cardioprotective effect of low-dose aspirin may be antagonized by coadministration of some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Ibuprofen has been specifically implicated, and there is evidence that others including indomethacin, naproxen, and tiaprofenic acid may also interact. The mechanism is competitive inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase by certain NSAIDs, which, unlike aspirin, bind reversibly at the active site of the enzyme and cause a temporary rather than persistent depression of thromboxane formation and thromboxane-dependent platelet function. The combined use of aspirin with NSAIDs in general may increase the potential for serious gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity, including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation.","Patients receiving low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection should avoid the regular use of ibuprofen and possibly other NSAIDs. Occasional use of ibuprofen is acceptable, as the risk from any attenuation of the antiplatelet effect of low-dose aspirin is likely to be minimal given the long-lasting effect of aspirin on platelets. In patients receiving immediate-release (not enteric-coated) aspirin, single doses of ibuprofen 400 mg may be used but should not be administered within 8 hours before or 30 minutes after the aspirin dose. There are currently no specific recommendations regarding the dosing and timing of single-dose ibuprofen in patients receiving enteric-coated low-dose aspirin. For patients requiring routine NSAID therapy with concomitant low-dose aspirin, diclofenac may be a viable alternative. In the retrospective study implicating ibuprofen, 75 mg twice daily of delayed-release diclofenac did not interfere with the antiplatelet activity of aspirin. Other noninterfering alternatives for pain include acetaminophen, celecoxib, or narcotic analgesics. In any case, caution is advised whenever aspirin is combined with a NSAID due to the potential for additive GI toxicity. Patients should be advised to take the medications with food and to immediately report signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding such as abdominal pain, bloating, sudden dizziness or lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, anorexia, and melena.",10165,"[1] Wilner KD, Rushing M, Walden C, et al.

A limit of 2 inactivated vaccines should be administered per month.

Patients may be immunosuppressed if they have recently received or are receiving alkylating agents, antimetabolites, radiation, some antirheumatic agents, high dosages of corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic agents, or long-term topical or inhaled corticosteroids. These patients may also have increased adverse reactions and decreased or suboptimal immunologic response to vaccines.","In general, live attenuated vaccines should not be used in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy or cancer chemotherapy. Vaccination should be deferred until after such therapy is discontinued and immune function has been restored, usually 4 to 12 weeks after stopping immunosuppressive therapy. A longer waiting period may be necessary following treatment with agents that have a prolonged elimination half-life (e.g., leflunomide, teriflunomide). Current local immunization guidelines should be consulted for recommendations.",121845,"[1] Fauci AS, Braunwald E, Isselbacher KJ, Wilson JD, Martin JB, Kasper DL, Hauser SL, Longo DL, eds.
