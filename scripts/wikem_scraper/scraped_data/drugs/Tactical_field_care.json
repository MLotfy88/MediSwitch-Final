If a\ntourniquet\nis not needed, use other techniques to control bleeding.\nWhen time and the tactical situation permit, a distal pulse check should be accomplished. If a distal pulse is still present, consider additional tightening of the\ntourniquet\nor the use of a second\ntourniquet\n, side by side and proximal to the first, to eliminate the distal pulse.\nExpose and clearly mark all\ntourniquet\nsites with the time of\ntourniquet\napplication.

For extensive burns (>20%), consider placing the casualty in the Heat-Reflective Shell or Blizzard Survival Blanket from the\nHypothermia\nPrevention Kit in order to both cover the burned areas and prevent hypothermia.\nFluid resuscitation (USAISR Rule of Ten)\nIf burns are greater than 20% of Total Body Surface Area, fluid resuscitation should be initiated as soon as IV/IO access is established. Resuscitation should be initiated with Lactated Ringer’s, normal saline, or Hextend. If Hextend is used, no more than 1000ml should be given, followed by Lactated Ringer’s or normal saline as needed.\nInitial IV/IO fluid rate is calculated as %\nTBSA\nx 10cc/hr for adults weighing 40- 80 kg.\nFor every 10 kg ABOVE 80 kg, increase initial rate by 100ml/hr.\nIf hemorrhagic\nshock\nis also present, resuscitation for hemorrhagic shock takes precedence over resuscitation for burn shock. Administer IV/IO fluids per the TCCC Guidelines in Section 6.\nAnalgesia in accordance with the TCCC Guidelines in Section 12 may be administered to treat burn pain.\nPrehospital\nantibiotic\ntherapy is not indicated solely for burns, but antibiotics should be given per the TCCC guidelines in Section 14 if indicated to prevent infection in penetrating wounds.\nAll TCCC interventions can be performed on or through burned skin in a burn casualty.",
