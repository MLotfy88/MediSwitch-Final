Some authorities recommend avoiding concomitant use of larotrectinib and sensitive CYP450 3A4 substrates or substrates with narrow therapeutic ranges. These drugs include, but are not limited to: alfentanil, cisapride, colchicine, cyclosporine, fentanyl, ivacaftor, lovastatin, simvastatin, oral midazolam, triazolam, pimozide, quinidine, sildenafil, ergot derivatives, macrolide immunosuppressants, and vinca alkaloids.', 'Metabolism', 'Caution is advised when larotrectinib is used concomitantly with drugs that are substrates of CYP450 3A4, particularly those with a narrow therapeutic range.', 'Moderate', 'pharmacodynamic', NULL, 'https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/125952/', '', 'Alvimopan, Sorbitol, Tegaserod, Bisacodyl, Lactulose, Methylnaltrexone, Lactitol, Sodium phosphate, monobasic, Magnesium oxide, Sodium sulfate, Prucalopride, More', 'Entrectinib, Acalabrutinib, Dacomitinib, Avapritinib, Bosutinib, Selumetinib, Vandetanib, Cobimetinib, Ibrutinib, Afatinib, Tivozanib, More', 1767369485);
