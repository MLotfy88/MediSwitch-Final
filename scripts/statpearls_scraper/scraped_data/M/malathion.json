    "indications": "Organophosphates encompass a diverse group of chemical compounds and are formed through esterification between phosphoric acid and alcohol. Currently, organophosphates have common applications in pesticides and herbicides, as well as nerve agents in chemical warfare. Therefore, most patients exposed to organophosphates typically encounter these compounds through the use of insecticides and herbicides. When introduced into the body, organophosphates inhibit the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), resulting in an overabundance of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. This surplus of acetylcholine in the body manifests with cholinergic toxidrome, which includes effects on nicotinic and muscarinic receptors, as well as the central nervous system (CNS). The onset of symptoms, which varies based on the specific compound, frequently occurs within minutes, and resolution can take several weeks.\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n\nAlthough developed nations have experienced a decline in organophosphate poisoning cases due to stricter regulations on the use of these chemicals, developing countries have continued to grapple with clinical concerns related to this condition in recent years. Pesticides are frequently used as a means of self-harm due to their lethality and widespread availability in the developing world. Therefore, developing nations that heavily depend on agriculture and often have less stringent pesticide regulations result in the majority of cases of organophosphate toxicity. Research indicates that deliberate poisoning leads to a higher mortality rate than accidental exposure to these compounds.\n[6]\n[7]\nRespiratory failure resulting from bronchorrhea and bronchospasm is the leading cause of death in cases of organophosphate toxicity. Chronic toxicity and neurological complications, such as the intermediate syndrome, are also well documented. In industrial or developed nations, healthcare professionals must possess the capability to recognize this toxicity, given the potential for its utilization as a weapon in acts of warfare and terrorism. Antidotal therapy and comprehensive supportive care are necessary for the effective treatment of organophosphate toxicity to prevent morbidity and mortality.\n\nHistory of Organophosphates Use\n\nThe first organophosphate insecticide was developed in the mid-1800s, but it only gained widespread usage after World War II. Initially, in the 1930s, these compounds were used as insecticides before finding application as neurotoxins by the German military. The organophosphate chemicals sarin and VX were utilized by the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo in 1994 and 1995, marking the initial reported instances of VX's use as a terrorist agent. In February 1997, the first reported murder involving VX occurred with the assassination of Kim Jong-nam at a Malaysian airport. In March 2018, the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal took place in England, leading to the hospitalization of a police officer who was also poisoned during this assassination attempt. The compound used in this event was the organophosphorus agent known as Novichok.\n[8]\n[9]",
    "mechanism": "Organophosphate toxicity can occur either due to occupational or accidental exposure to pesticides, intentional self-harm exposure, or chemical warfare and terrorist attacks. Over 50,000 compounds have been developed and evaluated for pesticidal activity. In the United States, 37 organophosphate pesticides have been registered, all of which have the potential to cause toxicity. In the developing world, this number is higher due to less stringent regulation of these compounds. Organophosphate exposure can occur through inhalation, ingestion, or contact with skin. Although these compounds are readily absorbed in the body after inhalation and ingestion, systemic absorption following dermal exposure shows more significant variability.\n\nThe onset, severity, and duration of toxicity depend on the ingested amount, absorption route, and the specific pesticide's toxicokinetics.\n[10]\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) classifies these compounds into 5 groups, ranging from \"Extremely hazardous\" to \"Active ingredients unlikely to present acute hazard in normal use.\" This classification is derived from the data based on the median lethal dose (LD\n50\n), which represents the rat's oral lethal dose for 50% of individuals exposed to the active ingredient. However, the LD\n50\nclassification is limited in differentiating more toxic compounds within the same class.",
    "monitoring": "As the diagnosis of organophosphate poisoning relies on clinical evaluation, initiating treatment before laboratory confirmation is essential. A high clinical suspicion for organophosphate poisoning is crucial, especially when there is no known history of exposure or ingestion. The most prevalent presentation of toxicity involves a patient with miotic pupils, diaphoresis, and respiratory distress. Some organophosphates emit a distinctive garlic or petroleum odor that can aid in diagnosis.\n\nIf organophosphate poisoning is on the differential but not confirmed, a trial of atropine may be administered. If symptoms improve following the administration of 0.6 to 1 mg of atropine, this raises suspicion of AChE inhibitor poisoning. However, due to the lack of studies, interpreting the sensitivity and specificity of this trial can be challenging, particularly in cases of severe poisoning. Therefore, further studies are needed to address this issue. In cases of significant poisoning, patients may not exhibit any response to a small dose of atropine, which can result in a false-negative test.\n\nAlthough some laboratories can directly measure cholinesterase activity, these tests are often outsourced to facilities that may not provide results promptly to guide therapy. The 2 commonly measured cholinesterases are BuChE and red blood cell AChE (RBC AChE). BuChE activity is less specific than RBC AChE activity. Low BuChE activity may also be observed in individuals with hereditary enzyme dysfunction, hepatic disease, chronic illness, malnutrition, and iron deficiency anemia. The extent of enzyme inhibition varies depending on the specific organophosphate involved in the poisoning, and limited data exist for many compounds, thereby further complicating the interpretation of this test.\n\nRBC AChE activity is believed to have a stronger correlation with the clinical features of organophosphate toxicity. In clinical settings, symptoms typically develop when more than 50% of this enzyme is inhibited, although this threshold can vary with specific compounds.\n[26]\nNotably, it is essential to collect blood samples in appropriate tubes, as fluoride can deactivate the enzymes, potentially yielding falsely low activity levels.\n\nHealthcare providers may order a range of essential laboratory tests, including specific diagnostic tests for organophosphate poisoning, as well as other tests to assess the patient's overall health. These may include a complete blood cell count (CBC), a basic metabolic panel test, liver and kidney function tests, glucose level tests, arterial blood gas analysis, and pregnancy testing. The electrocardiogram (ECG) typically reveals sinus bradycardia due to parasympathetic activation.",
    "administration": "Before assessing and treating a patient with organophosphate toxicity, all healthcare providers must don personal protective equipment to minimize the risk of self-contamination. Adhering to universal precautions helps maintain a low contamination rate among healthcare workers.\n[27]\nOnce healthcare workers are assured of their safety through appropriate protective measures, the initial step involves decontaminating the patients. This is followed by washing the patient's skin thoroughly with soap and water 3 times. The primary goal of this approach is to quickly clean without needing specific decontamination fluids. Caution should be exercised when dealing with bodily secretions, including vomit and diarrhea, as organophosphates can be found in these fluids. All clothing worn by the patients should be taken off and disposed of. As long hair can trap highly lipophilic compounds, it should be cut if washing fails. Although decontaminating the patient is essential, it should not delay timely medical intervention for a patient in severe distress.\n[28]\n\nAirway control is of paramount importance while treating patients with organophosphate toxicity. In some patients, intubation may be required due to bronchospasm, seizures, or bronchorrhea. However, it is noteworthy that succinylcholine should be avoided during intubation as it cannot be metabolized and leads to prolonged paralysis. Patients should also receive intravenous access, cardiac monitoring, and pulse oximetry.\n\nThe primary treatment for organophosphate poisoning involves atropine, which competes with acetylcholine at the muscarinic receptors. Atropine is administered intravenously (IV) with an initial dose of 2 to 5 mg for adults and 0.05 mg/kg for children, aiming to achieve the adult dose. If the patient does not respond to the treatment, the healthcare team should double the dose every 3 to 5 minutes until respiratory secretions have cleared and there is no bronchoconstriction. At this point, the state of \"atropinization\" is achieved, which is characterized by the appearance of anticholinergic signs and symptoms in the patient, including dry skin and mucosa, decreased bowel sounds, tachycardia, no bronchospasm, reduced secretions, and mydriasis.\n[29]\n\nThe main objective of using atropine is to improve cardiorespiratory parameters in patients dealing with organophosphate toxicity. Assessment of heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory status is more crucial than pupil size and skin moisture. Patients with severe poisoning may require the administration of hundreds of milligrams of atropine, either as bolus doses or continuous infusion, over the course of several days to weeks until the patient shows improvement. As atropine does not mitigate nicotinic effects, patients must be closely monitored for the potential development of neuromuscular junction dysfunction and respiratory failure. Monitoring parameters such as tidal volume and negative inspiratory force can assist in assessing the necessity for ventilatory support.\n\nThe antidote pralidoxime (2-PAM) operates by reactivating the phosphorylated AChE by binding with the organophosphate. However, for the antidote to work effectively, it must be administered before the onset of aging, and this time frame is specific to each particular compound. This agent does not depress the respiratory center and can be used in conjunction with atropine. However, the evidence regarding the use of oximes for the treatment of organophosphate poisoning is inconsistent and subject to controversy. Studies have shown that the addition of 2-PAM to atropine did not improve mortality and carried potential risks.\n[30]\nTherefore, until a clearer understanding is reached and alternative treatments emerge, it is advisable to treat all patients poisoned with organophosphorus agents with an oxime.\n\nAtropine must be administered to patients before 2-PAM to prevent the exacerbation of muscarinic-mediated symptoms. Healthcare providers recommend a bolus of at least 30 mg/kg for adults and 20 to 50 mg/kg for children over 30 minutes. As rapid administration of 2-PAM can lead to cardiac arrest, caution should be exercised while administering the medication to patients. After the bolus, a continuous infusion of the medication at a rate of at least 8 mg/kg/h for adults and 10 to 20 mg/kg/h for children should be initiated, which may be required for several days.\n[31]\n[32]\n\nPatients experiencing seizures should be administered benzodiazepines. Although there is a single study suggesting the potential benefits of diazepam in preventing neuropathy, benzodiazepines are not generally recommended unless seizures are actively occurring.\n[33]\nIn the case of specific organophosphate compounds with a limited volume of distribution, such as dimethoate and dichlorvos, extracorporeal elimination may be beneficial. However, there is limited data regarding the overall effectiveness of hemodialysis and hemoperfusion in all cases of poisoning. Due to the potential for recurring symptoms and respiratory distress, patients should be admitted to the hospital and closely monitored for a minimum of 48 hours within an ICU setting. Patients who remain asymptomatic for 12 hours may be considered for discharge.",
    "adverse_effects": "A condition called the \"intermediate syndrome\" has been identified, which causes muscle weakness that may lead to respiratory failure without cholinergic signs or fasciculations.\n[36]\nThis syndrome typically occurs 24 to 96 hours after the onset of organophosphate poisoning and after the cholinergic crisis has ended. Patients experience proximal muscle weakness and cranial nerve palsy, which can progress to respiratory failure. Typically, consciousness remains preserved in patients unless other complicating factors, such as hypoxia, are present. This syndrome can persist for several weeks.\n\nAs neck flexors are often the first muscles affected, close monitoring for this syndrome is crucial. An examination can be efficiently conducted by instructing patients to lift their heads off the bed. Not all patients who develop the intermediate syndrome experience respiratory failure. Although the exact pathophysiology of this syndrome remains incompletely understood, it is believed to result from dysfunction in the neuromuscular junction.\n\nPeripheral neuropathy can develop days to weeks after acute toxicity, and it is more frequently observed with specific compounds, including chlorpyrifos, dichlorvos, isofenphos, and methamidophos.\n[37]\nThis neuropathy arises due to the inhibition of the neuropathy target esterase enzyme, which catalyzes the breakdown of the major phospholipid within cell membranes in nervous tissues. The symptoms associated with this condition include muscle cramping in the lower extremities, distal numbness, and paresthesias affecting the extremities, which can advance to the loss of deep tendon reflexes. Individuals who survive this condition may also experience neuropsychiatric deficits such as confusion, memory impairment, lethargy, psychosis, irritability, and Parkinson-like symptoms."
