    "clinical_significance": "Surgical intervention is the gold standard for managing skin cancers. However, systemic therapies are an option for patients who are unable or unwilling to undergo surgery or have advanced disease. With the development of immunotherapy and targeted agents, the use of systemic chemotherapeutics in treating skin cancers has decreased. Nevertheless, for patients who are ineligible for or cannot tolerate immunotherapy or targeted therapies, chemotherapy remains a viable alternative.\n\nDespite the limited use of systemic chemotherapy, topical and intralesional chemotherapy are more commonly utilized, as mentioned earlier. Physicians should thoroughly discuss the expected course of treatment with patients, including potential adverse effects, the need for laboratory monitoring, and the required clinical follow-up."
