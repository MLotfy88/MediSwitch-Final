    "clinical_significance": "Dietary modifications focusing on anti-inflammatory bioactive components significantly reduce cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality risk.\n[18]\n[1]\n[28]\nA primary prevention trial comparing overall cardiovascular risk between participants adhering to a Mediterranean diet versus a reduced-fat diet identified a decrease in major cardiovascular events in 30% of participants with a high cardiovascular risk on the anti-inflammatory regimen.\n[29]\nAnother study focusing on secondary presentation of coronary heart disease noted a 73% relative risk reduction in patients adhering to the Mediterranean diet.\n[30]\nThese findings suggest that adherence to a typical anti-inflammatory diet reduces coronary vessel inflammation and the overall risk of CHD development.\n[30]\n\nEvidence supports a significant impact on developing breast and colorectal malignancies with strict adherence to an anti-inflammatory diet, specifically the Mediterranean diet.\n[15]\n[31]\n[32]\nThe effect of diet is further emphasized on the development of colorectal cancer by data that indicates reduced adherence to a proinflammatory Western diet reduces the incidence of malignancy.\n[32]\nA higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet demonstrated a lower incidence of prostate cancer and reduced aggressivity of the disease.\n[13]\nFor head and neck cancers, moderate adherence to the Mediterranean diet has been connected to a risk reduction of 17%, while high adherence showed a reduction of 34%.\n[14]\n\nHigher adherence to anti-inflammatory diets, specifically the Mediterranean diet, is associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of Alzheimer disease.\n[33]\nSimilar findings are noted when examining the potential relationship between cognitive decline and the incidence of dementia and adherence to a Mediterranean lifestyle of exercise, diet, and social engagement; adherence to a Mediterranean lifestyle demonstrated a 72% risk reduction for the development of dementia in those with the highest level of adherence.\n[34]\nThe lifestyle of the origin countries of the Mediterranean diet, including Greece, Italy, Spain, Egypt, and Lebanon, includes social engagement, physical activity, adequate rest, and culinary activities, which provide many positive neurocognitive benefits when combined with the dietary pattern. The PREDIMED study demonstrated a benefit in cognitive function with higher levels of Mediterranean diet adherence over 4 to 6 years, specifically in global cognition, memory, and executive function, compared to those with only 6 months of adherence\n[23]\n.\n\nClinicians in various specialties can use these findings to support recommending dietary changes to improve overall health status. Incorporating an anti-inflammatory diet with lifestyle modifications and medical therapies can provide long-term risk reduction of chronic, noncommunicable disease processes such as cardiovascular disease, malignancies, and neurocognitive decline."
