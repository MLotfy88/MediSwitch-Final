Since ACE inhibitors decrease the breakdown of kinins, it is conceivable that they may potentiate these reactions. Anaphylactic-type reactions, including fatalities, have followed the parenteral administration of iron dextran. Such reactions occur most often within the first several minutes of administration and are generally characterized by sudden onset of respiratory difficulty and/or cardiovascular collapse.

Resuscitation techniques and personnel trained in the detection and treatment of anaphylactic-type reactions should be readily available. Prior to the first therapeutic dose, a test dose corresponding to 25 mg iron should be injected gradually. Although anaphylactic reactions are usually evident within a few minutes, observe patients for at least one hour before administering the remainder of the therapeutic dose.
