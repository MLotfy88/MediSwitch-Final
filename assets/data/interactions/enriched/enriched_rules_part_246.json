The risk of systemic anticholinergic effects following topical administration depends on variables such as strength of the product, size of the application area, frequency of application, and use of occlusive dressing.  Systemic effects are uncommon following oral inhalation or nasal administration due to the poor absorption of quaternary ammonium compounds from gastrointestinal and nasal mucosa.", "source": "DDInter", "management_text": "Topical and inhaled anticholinergic preparations should preferably not be used in combination with other anticholinergic agents or agents with significant anticholinergic effects such as antihistamines, antispasmodics, neuroleptics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, tricyclic antidepressants, and class IA antiarrhythmics (especially disopyramide).  Caution is advised if concomitant use cannot be avoided, particularly in the elderly and those with significantly impaired renal and/or hepatic function.  Measures should be taken whenever possible to minimize ocular exposure to these drugs, such as keeping eyes closed during oral inhalation, use of a mouthpiece rather than face mask during nebulization, and not touching the eyes following topical application until hands are washed with soap and water.

Women using hormonal contraceptives should be advised of the risk of breakthrough bleeding and unintended pregnancy during concomitant therapy with St. John's wort.  Alternative or additional methods of birth control should be used during and for at least two weeks after short-term and 4 weeks after long-term (greater than 4 weeks) St. John's wort therapy.  If a combination oral contraceptive pill is used, a regimen containing at least 50 mcg of ethinyl estradiol per day or equivalent should be selected.  Although breakthrough bleeding is not necessarily indicative of low ethinyl estradiol serum levels or increased risk of ovulation, some clinicians suggest that women who experience breakthrough bleeding during enzyme-inducing therapy may be prescribed an increased dose of ethinyl estradiol above 50 mcg daily by combining more than one formulation of contraceptive pill if necessary.  For emergency contraception in patients who have used an hepatic enzyme inducer in the past 4 weeks, a non-hormonal emergency contraceptive (e.g., copper intrauterine device) is considered preferable.  If this is not possible, some authorities recommend that the usual dose of levonorgestrel (1.5 mg) should be doubled to 3 mg and taken as a single dose as soon as possible (within 72 hours of unprotected sexual intercourse).  However, there are no data on efficacy, compliance, or side effects of this regimen.  For women with the etonogestrel subdermal implant, the addition of a barrier method is recommended during concomitant use and for 28 days after discontinuation of hepatic enzyme inducing drugs.  It is recommended to remove the implant and to prescribe a nonhormonal method in women who require long-term treatment with hepatic enzyme inducing drugs.  No precautions or recommendations are available for women using hormone-releasing intrauterine systems, but a significant interaction with these systems is thought to be unlikely due to their local action.
