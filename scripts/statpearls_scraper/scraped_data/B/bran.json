    "clinical_significance": "A healthy dietary pattern containing nutrient-dense food sources in adequate amounts is fundamental for health maintenance and disease prevention at all stages of life. Macronutrients are nutrients the body needs in large quantities to support energy needs and meet physiologic requirements.\n[3]\nIntake of each macronutrient must meet essential requirements while allowing for an adequate balance between protein, carbohydrates, and fats without exceeding calorie limits.\n\nPer USDA recommendations, nutrient requirements should be met primarily through whole foods and beverages rather than supplements and include a variety of foods from different groups, including fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, and seeds, while limiting the intake of added sugars and saturated fats.\n[28]\n\nDeficient or excessive consumption of macronutrients may lead to adverse health effects and should be avoided. In particular, chronic excess calorie intake and weight gain should be avoided to reduce the risk of obesity and its associated conditions. Optimal protein intake should be ensured to minimize the risk of sarcopenia, especially among aging populations."
