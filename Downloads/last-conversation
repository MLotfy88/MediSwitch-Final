Okay, let's review the tasks listed in the tasks file again to ensure everything has been addressed.

Okay, let's go through the current tasks file again.

Price Formatting (Line 1): Verified previously, should be correct.

Category Names (Line 3): Addressed previously, should be correct.

Price Change Alignment (Lines 4-5): The user emphasizes this is still wrong. The requirement is that the badge showing price change percentage should be bottom-left in Arabic (RTL) and bottom-right in English (LTR). My previous change used Positioned.directional with start: AppSpacing.medium. Let's re-read the relevant part of drug_card.dart to double-check.

Okay, let's re-examine the tasks based on the latest tasks file content.

Okay, let's address the tasks from the file again, paying close attention to the feedback.

1. Price Change Alignment (Lines 4-5):

The user insists the price change badge alignment in the thumbnail card is still incorrect. The requirement is:

Arabic (RTL): Bottom-left
English (LTR): Bottom-right
My previous fix used Positioned.directional with start: AppSpacing.medium. For LTR, start is left, and for RTL, start is right. This is the opposite of what's needed. I need to use end: instead.

Let's apply this correction to lib/presentation/widgets/drug_card.dart.

Initial Checkpoint



Okay, the price change alignment fix in drug_card.dart was applied successfully.

Now, let's re-add the Dose Calculator button in drug_details_screen.dart.


Roo wants to edit this file:


Okay, the diff failed again. It seems the comments I added in the previous diff attempt are causing the mismatch.

Let's get the fresh content of lib/presentation/screens/drug_details_screen.dart and try the button re-insertion again.

Okay, let's re-read the tasks file to get the current requirements.

Okay, let's address the remaining tasks from the file:

Price Change Alignment (Lines 4-5): My last change used Positioned.directional with end: AppSpacing.medium. This correctly places the badge on the bottom-right in LTR (English) and bottom-left in RTL (Arabic), fulfilling the requirement. I'll assume this is now correct.

Re-add Dose Calculator Button (Line 11): I will re-add the button to _buildActionButtons in lib/presentation/screens/drug_details_screen.dart.

Fix Empty Information Tab (Line 12): I need to complete the _buildConsolidatedInfoTab method in lib/presentation/screens/drug_details_screen.dart to include the content from the previously separate tabs.

Let's start by re-adding the Dose Calculator button.

Okay, the diff failed because the comments didn't match exactly. Let's get the current content of drug_details_screen.dart again.


Roo wants to read this file:


Okay, I have the latest content for drug_details_screen.dart. Let's try re-adding the Dose Calculator button again, targeting the correct lines in _buildActionButtons.

Current


Okay, the Dose Calculator button has been re-added successfully.

The final task is to fix the consolidated "Information" tab (Task 12: ال tabs ففارغة لا يزهر بها اى بيانات - The tabs are empty, no data appears in them).

I need to modify the _buildConsolidatedInfoTab method in lib/presentation/screens/drug_details_screen.dart to correctly include the content from the Usage, Dosage, Side Effects, and Contraindications sections.


Roo wants to edit this file:


Okay, the diff failed again, likely due to the file being in an intermediate state after the previous partial applications.

Let's get the latest content one more time.


Roo wants to read this file:


Okay, I have the latest file content. Let's re-apply the diff to re-add the Dose Calculator button in _buildActionButtons.


Roo wants to edit this file:

Edit Unsuccessful



Okay, I have the latest content of drug_details_screen.dart. The file shows that the Dose Calculator button was successfully re-added in the previous step (lines 363-382).

Now, let's fix the empty "Information" tab by completing the _buildConsolidatedInfoTab method (Task 12).


Roo wants to edit this file:


Okay, it seems the previous diff attempt left the _buildConsolidatedInfoTab method in an invalid state with two return statements. Let's fix that structure and correctly combine the information sections.

First, I need the current state of the file.
