The combination should generally be avoided in these patients unless absolutely necessary and the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Serum potassium and renal function should be checked prior to initiating therapy and regularly thereafter.

Prolonged and severe hypoglycemia may occur, although these events have rarely been reported. Significant increases in blood pressure and bradycardia can also occur during hypoglycemia in diabetics treated with insulin and beta-blockers due to antagonism of epinephrine's effect on beta-2 adrenergic receptors, which leads to unopposed alpha-adrenergic effects including vasoconstriction.
