  "sections": {
    "indications": "Contraindications for the use of doxazosin are:\n\nHypersensitivity to doxazosin or other quinazolines.\nPregnancy\nDoxazosin is Pregnancy Category C, meaning that there is no adequate data on the safety of doxazosin in pregnant women.",
    "mechanism": "Doxazosin is a quinazoline derivative that acts as a competitive alpha1-antagonist at the post-synaptic receptor.\n\nIn Hypertension\n\nDoxazosin competitively inhibits post-synaptic alpha1-adrenergic receptors causing vasodilation of arterioles and veins, which results in decreased total peripheral resistance and blood pressure.\n\nIn Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia\n\nSymptoms of BPH are caused by mechanical or dynamic obstruction of urine flow through the urethra. Mechanical obstruction is mostly due to prostate size. Dynamic obstruction is associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone at the neck of the bladder and the prostate. Doxazosin works by blocking alpha1 receptors, thereby decreasing urethral resistance and improving urine flow.\n[12]",
    "administration": "Formulations\n\nTablet, Oral:\n1 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg\n\nTablet, Oral, as mesylate:\n8 mg\n\nTablet Extended-Release 24 Hour, Oral:\n4 mg, 8 mg\nAs with all extended-release formulations, this formulation should not be crushed to pass through a nasogastric, orogastric, or PEG tube.\n\nDosing\n\nBenign Prostatic Hyperplasia\nOral Immediate Release: Initiate at 1 mg once daily. The dose may be titrated up at 1- to 2-week intervals up to a maximum dose of 8 mg once daily. This titration should take place by doubling the dose while monitoring for response and tolerability.\nOral Extended Release: Initiate at 4 mg once daily. The dose may be titrated up at 3- to 4-week intervals up to a maximum dose of 8 mg once daily. The clinician should titrate by doubling the dose while monitoring for response and tolerability.\nThe reinitiation of Therapy: If therapy discontinues for several days, reinitiate therapy at the initial dose and titrate according to the initial dose regimen.\n\nHypertension\nOral Immediate Release: Initiate at 1 mg once daily. The dose may be titrated up to 16 mg once daily; this should occur while monitoring for response and tolerability.",
    "adverse_effects": "Dose-related Adverse Effects\n\nOrthostatic hypotension/syncope can occur, especially when combined with another antihypertensive, nitrates, or a PDE-5 inhibitor.\nThese adverse effects occur most commonly after the initial dose or following the reinitiation of therapy; this requires patients to follow a multistep titration regimen to avoid syncope.\n\nCommon Adverse Effects\n\nDizziness\nFatigue\nHeadache\nWeakness\nTachycardia\nUpper respiratory tract infection\nEdema\nRhinitis\nDyspnea\nAllergic reactions\n\nIn a research study, researchers randomly assigned a total of 3,047 men were randomly assigned to groups of a placebo, doxazosin, or combination therapy with finasteride. Adverse effects of orthostatic hypotension and dizziness occurred significantly more in the groups taking doxazosin and combination treatment compared to the placebo group. Rates of adverse effects were reported to peak at year one during a mean duration of 4.5 years of treatment.\n[13]",
    "monitoring": "Effective therapy with doxazosin for its various indications requires titration based upon response and tolerability. Open communication between patients and providers is crucial for successful treatment. Patients should receive education on the different common side effects of doxazosin, and the provider should conduct a thorough review of other medications for possible interactions, paying particular attention to other antihypertensives, nitrates, and PDE-5 inhibitors.",
    "toxicity": "Reports with overdosage and toxicity with the alpha-1 antagonists, including doxazosin, remain very limited in the literature. There is a report of one case of acute doxazosin overdose in 2005.\n[14]\nThe study found that the patient presented to the emergency department (ED) with drowsiness, decreased blood pressure, and reflex tachycardia but did not have orthostatic hypotension or any other abnormalities. This patient was able to fully awaken with supportive therapy in 8 hours and was discharged 48 hours after admission to the ED. Although there are limited works of literature for the toxicity of doxazosin, it appears to have low acute toxicity."
