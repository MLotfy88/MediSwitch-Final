Sotalol has dose-dependent proarrhythmic effects related to prolongation of the QT interval.  The risk of torsades de pointes is progressively increased as the degree of prolongation becomes greater.  The manufacturer states that sotalol should be used with particular caution in patients whose QTc is greater than 500 msec on- therapy.  Serious consideration should be given to reducing the dosage or discontinuing therapy when the QTc exceeds 550 msec.The use of sotalol is contraindicated in patients with hypokalemia (< 4 meq/L).  Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia may augment the prolongation effect of sotalol on the QT interval and should be corrected prior to institution of sotalol therapy.  In addition, patients who experience frequent, severe, or prolonged diarrhea may be subject to electrolyte losses and should be followed closely and managed accordingly during therapy with sotalol.', '3', '', 'DDInter', 0);
