The proposed mechanism is inhibition by amiodarone of intestinal and hepatic CYP450 3A4, resulting in enhanced bioavailability as well as reduced clearance of simvastatin and its active metabolite, simvastatin acid. Although not studied, the interaction is also expected to occur with lovastatin due to its similar metabolic profile to simvastatin. In general, the risk of myopathy associated with the statin class of drugs is thought to be dose-related and increased by high levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity in plasma. Myopathy manifested as muscle pain and/or weakness associated with grossly elevated creatine kinase exceeding ten times the upper limit of normal has been reported occasionally. Rhabdomyolysis has also occurred rarely, which may be accompanied by acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria and may result in death.",

Otherwise, a dosage reduction, slower titration, or even discontinuation of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor should be considered. For patients who are already receiving an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor with anticholinergic agents, every attempt should be made to discontinue the latter or substitute them with less anticholinergic alternatives.
