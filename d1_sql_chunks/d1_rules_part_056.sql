The proposed mechanism is decreased clearance due to inhibition of CYP450 2D6 activity. Increased concentrations of valbenazine and (+)-alfa-dihydrotetrabenazine may lead to clinically significant prolongation of the QT interval. In general, the risk of an individual agent or a combination of agents causing ventricular arrhythmia in association with QT prolongation is largely unpredictable but may be increased by certain underlying risk factors such as congenital long QT syndrome, cardiac disease, and electrolyte disturbances (e.g., hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia). The extent of drug-induced QT prolongation is dependent on the particular drugs involved and dosages of the drugs. In addition, central nervous system (CNS)-depressant effects may be additively or synergistically increased in patients taking valbenazine with certain other drugs that cause these effects, especially in elderly or debilitated patients.', NULL, 'Pharmacologic response to valbenazine should be monitored more closely whenever a strong inhibitor of CYP450 2D6 (e.', NULL, 'Pharmacologic response to valbenazine should be monitored more closely whenever a strong inhibitor of CYP450 2D6 (e.g., paroxetine, fluoxetine, quinidine) is added to or withdrawn from therapy. Valbenazine is not recommended for use in patients with congenital long QT syndrome or with arrhythmias associated with a prolonged QT interval. Assessment of baseline QT interval and periodic monitoring during therapy may be considered. The manufacturer recommends a dosage reduction for valbenazine during concomitant administration with strong CYP450 2D6 inhibitors or in patients who are poor metabolizers of CYP450 2D6. Patients should be advised to seek prompt medical attention if they experience symptoms that could indicate the occurrence of torsade de pointes such as dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, palpitation, irregular heart rhythm, shortness of breath, or syncope. When valbenazine is used in combination with other drugs that cause CNS depression, patients should be monitored for potentially excessive or prolonged CNS depression. Ambulatory patients should be counseled to avoid hazardous activities requiring mental alertness and motor coordination until they know how these agents affect them, and to notify their doctor if they experience excessive or prolonged CNS effects that interfere with their normal activities.', 'Metabolism', NULL, NULL, 'Major', NULL, 'DDInter', 'pharmacodynamic', NULL, 'https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/28539/', '[1] "Product Information.
