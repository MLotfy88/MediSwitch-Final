Antihypertensive agents such as diuretics may potentiate the orthostatic effect that is occasionally observed upon the initiation of SSRI or SNRI therapy. Syncope and orthostatic hypotension tend to occur within the first week of SNRI/SSRI therapy but can occur at any time during treatment, particularly after a dosage increase. The use of SSRIs or SNRIs may also cause sustained increases in blood pressure and heart rate, which may antagonize the therapeutic effects of antihypertensive medications.', NULL, 'Caution is recommended if SSRIs or SNRIs are prescribed in combination with diuretics, particularly in the elderly.', NULL, 'Caution is recommended if SSRIs or SNRIs are prescribed in combination with diuretics, particularly in the elderly. Patients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience potential signs and symptoms of hyponatremia such as nausea, vomiting, headache, malaise, lethargy, irritability, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, muscle spasm, and unsteadiness (which may lead to falls). More severe and/or acute cases may include hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. Discontinuation of SSRI/SNRI therapy should be considered in patients who develop symptomatic hyponatremia, and appropriate medical intervention instituted as necessary. Patients should also have their blood pressure and pulse monitored before and during SSRI/SNRI therapy, especially during the first few weeks and following a dosage increase. Patients should be advised to avoid rising abruptly from a sitting or recumbent position and to notify their doctor if they experience dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope, orthostasis, or tachycardia.', 'Synergism', 'Eplerenone, Finerenone', 'Desipramine, St. John''s Wort, Oxitriptan, Viloxazine, Tryptophan, Esketamine', 'Moderate', NULL, 'DDInter', 'pharmacodynamic', NULL, 'https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/21030/', '[1] "Product Information.

The proposed mechanism is azole inhibition of CYP450 3A4, the isoenzyme responsible for the metabolic clearance of amiodarone. The use of amiodarone has been associated with prolongation of the QT interval, thus elevated plasma levels of the drug may potentiate the risk of ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia and torsade de pointes as well as cardiac arrest and sudden death. Within the azole class, ketoconazole and itraconazole are considered potent inhibitors, while fluconazole is comparatively weak and generally causes clinically significant interactions with CYP450 3A4 substrates only at dosages of 200 mg/day or more.', NULL, 'Given the potential for serious and life-threatening adverse cardiac events associated with increased plasma levels of amiodarone, concomitant use with azole antifungal agents should generally be avoided if possible.', NULL, 'Given the potential for serious and life-threatening adverse cardiac events associated with increased plasma levels of amiodarone, concomitant use with azole antifungal agents should generally be avoided if possible.

These symptoms may be followed by sharp shooting pains or severe continuous burning pain if the drug is not withdrawn, and progress to severe pain requiring narcotic analgesics.
