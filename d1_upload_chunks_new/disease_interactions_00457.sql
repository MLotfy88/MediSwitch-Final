This risk may occur early in treatment and may increase with duration of use.  Clinical trials of several cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to 3 years duration have supported this increased risk.  It is unclear from available data if the risk for cardiovascular thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs.  Therapy with NSAIDs should be administered cautiously in patients with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease.  Patients should be treated with the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration necessary.  Appropriate antiplatelet therapy should be administered to patients requiring cardioprotection; however, there is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events associated with NSAID use, while the risk of serious gastrointestinal events is increased.  Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of adverse cardiovascular events throughout the entire duration of therapy, even without prior cardiovascular symptoms.  Patients should be advised to promptly seek medical attention if they experience symptoms of cardiovascular thrombotic events (including chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, or slurring of speech).NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.  Two large clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke.The use of NSAIDs should be avoided in patients with a recent myocardial infarction unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent cardiovascular thrombotic events.
