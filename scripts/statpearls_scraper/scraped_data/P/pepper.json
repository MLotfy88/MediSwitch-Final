    "indications": "Tear gas and pepper spray are a group of heterogeneous agents known under broader categories as riot control agents, harassing agents, incapacitating agents, or lacrimators. Although initially utilized by the military in World War I, they are now used for personal protection or by law enforcement agencies as a non-lethal option for subduing combative subjects as well as crowd control.\n[1]\nAs a group, these substances cause acute eye pain, tearing, skin irritation, and respiratory tract irritation.\n\nThe prototypical tear gasses are o-chlorobenzylidenemalononitrile (CS), chloroacetophenone (CN), and dibenzoxazepine (CR). CN was initially developed at the end of the first world war, although it did not get used during combat. After this time, CN was primarily utilized by military and law enforcement agencies until the development of CS, which is more potent and less toxic.\n[1]\nCS, named for its creators Corson and Stoughton, was first developed in 1928 and first used in 1958 by the British army.\n[2]\nCS was an attractive agent for law enforcement because it was more effective in the open air. It has mostly replaced CN by law enforcement agencies.\n[3]\n\nPepper spray was created in the late 1970s and found use by law enforcement agencies in the early 1980s.\n[4]\nOleoresin capsicum (OC) is the active agent in pepper spray, which is an oily concentrated extract from plants of the genus\nCapsicum\n, more commonly referred to as the chili pepper.\n[5]\nThe physiologic and pharmacologic effects of capsaicin have been a topic of study since the 1920s.\n[6]\nMore recently it has found favor as a riot-control agent with law enforcement agencies. It produces some similar effects compared to the other tear gases and has become the popular agent for civilian use.\n[1]",
    "mechanism": "Typically, these agents are deployed in an aerosol or liquid form. In law enforcement or military settings, grenades or canisters can be thrown or shot into an area. Additionally, the dispersion can be through handheld spray devices.\n[1]\nAerosol generally refers to spraying into a large area for crowd control, compared with sprays which are typically handheld canisters sprayed at a single person to incapacitate them. Mace was a mixture of CN and hydrocarbons in a spray canister for use as personal protection. On occasion, these products can be added to water and dispersed via water canon or other large-scale devices like bombs or large spray tanks.\n[1]\nImmediately upon contact, these agents begin to exhibit effects on the skin, eyes, respiratory tract, and mucous membranes.\n\nThough colloquially referred to as “tear gas,” the CN, CS, and OC compounds are not actually gases but solids at room temperature.\n[7]\nThese agents have low solubility in water, so most agents are dissolved in organic solvents, allowing their use as aerosols or microparticulates.\n[2]\nAnother method for aerosolizing these agents uses high-temperature dispersion, typically greater than 700 degrees Celsius.\n[8]",
    "monitoring": "Hazardous materials management principles apply with initial decontamination by copious irrigation first to both treat the victim and prevent responders and healthcare professionals from becoming contaminated. It is unlikely but possible depending on the setting that workers could be exposed to riot control agents and become symptomatic. Providers will need to exercise reasonable judgment unless other traumatic injuries demand immediate resuscitation, the patient needs decontamination before entering the healthcare environment. After initial stabilization, decontamination may be considered depending on the setting; this can initially start in the field if a patient is presenting via EMS. Aerosolized gases are heavier than the surrounding air, which is why an incapacitated patient should get lifted off of the ground, EMS vehicles should also try to park in higher areas than where the dispersion of gases occurred. Initial on-scene irrigation of the eyes especially is important. The use of topical ophthalmic anesthetic drops, such as proparacaine, helps with the ability to perform adequate eye irrigation.\n\nHospital workers can use customary personal protective equipment. Removal of contaminated clothing and prompt decontamination may be performed, including flushing the eyes and skin with copious amounts of water. If explosive devices were used to disperse agents, a close inspection of the skin and eyes should be performed to evaluate for foreign bodies, lesions, and shrapnel. Depending on the extent of ocular symptoms, a more detailed ophthalmologic exam with corneal fluorescein staining could be an option.\n[1]\nIf there are concerning pulmonary signs or symptoms, pulse oximetry, arterial blood gas analysis, and chest radiography can be obtained to evaluate for acute lung injury. There are no routinely available laboratory tests for identification or confirmation of riot control agent exposure.",
    "administration": "Management of patients exposed to riot control agents should begin with the customary resuscitative priorities of securing the airway, ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and supporting hemodynamics. The face should be wiped with a moist towel to remove any particles before being washed. Copious water irrigation with soap should be used to remove contaminants. If there is significant skin breakdown, saline irrigation is the best choice.\n[1]\nOther solutions (milk, baby shampoo, antacids) have been investigated and have had mixed data regarding their benefit, but do no further harm. Amphoteric chelating irrigation fluid in research models appears to be effective in decontaminating a variety of chemical exposures to the skin or eyes but is generally not available in many clinical settings, and decontamination with water should not be delayed while searching for alternative decontamination fluids.\n[2]\n\nManagement of ocular exposures involves copious irrigation with water or saline. Irrigation should occur for at least 10 to 20 minutes but can continue longer if the patient continues to have ocular symptoms. Remove contact lenses before irrigation. A topical anesthetic should be used to reduce pain and blepharospasm, and improve irrigation.\n[1]\nWith CS exposures, soap or shampoo can be added to irrigation since CS is sparingly soluble in water. Amphoteric chelating irrigation fluid has also been noted to be effective for ocular irrigation and may prevent further chemical injuries to the eye. In patients with severe chemical injuries, systemic corticosteroids can reduce inflammation.\n[18]\nFor significant corneal injuries, there should be consultation with ophthalmology.\n\nThe majority of respiratory symptoms following exposure to these agents are mild and self-limited, most resolve within 10 to 20 minutes after removal from exposure. Management of respiratory symptoms is largely supportive. Suctioning is an option for patients with copious secretions. If bronchospasm is present, beta-agonists and steroids can be administered. Patients with asthma, emphysema, or bronchitis may present with an acute exacerbation. Very rarely, these agents can precipitate laryngospasm, causing respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Late findings are rare but may include reactive airway dysfunction and pulmonary edema. Treatment of acute lung injury is supportive and may include supplemental oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, or mechanical ventilation depending on the severity.\n[1]\n\nGastrointestinal symptoms are uncommon, but some patients will have nausea and vomiting. If oral exposure to the spray occurred this may increase the likelihood of gastrointestinal symptoms. Symptomatic treatment with intravenous rehydration, antiemetic agents, and electrolyte replacement is generally adequate. Given that the gastrointestinal symptoms are typically minor and self-limited, decontamination techniques including gastric lavage or activated charcoal are not necessary.\n[1]\n\nIn law enforcement or military training environments, amphoteric chelating irrigation fluid may be useful as pre-treatment. In one study, police officers prophylactically exposed to the solution had less facial pain after entering a CS cloud and returned to action sooner.\n[12]",
    "adverse_effects": "The majority of exposures to lachrymator agents are benign with their irritant effects revolving within 30 minutes.\n[6]\nRarely serious exposure can lead to more severe injuries to the eyes, dermis, and respiratory tract. Acute injuries of the eye can include hyphemia, uveitis, necrotizing keratitis, cataracts, and traumatic optic neuropathy, which can ultimately result in decreased or lost vision.\n[1]\n[5]\nInjuries to the dermis can range from a mild rash, up to severe full-thickness burns.\n[1]\n[5]\n[6]\nSevere respiratory injuries include bronchospasm, chemical pneumonitis, pulmonary edema, and asphyxia requiring intensive care. Death is rare.\n[19]"
