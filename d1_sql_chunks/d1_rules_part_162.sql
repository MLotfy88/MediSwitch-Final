Inotersen should not be administered in patients with a platelet count below 100 x 10^9/L or in patients who are unable to adhere to the recommended laboratory monitoring and management guidelines. Caution is advised when inotersen is prescribed with other potentially nephrotoxic agents such as deferasirox. Serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR), and a urinalysis should be obtained prior to initiation of inotersen and regularly during and for at least 8 weeks after treatment in accordance with the product labeling. Inotersen should generally not be initiated in patients with a UPCR of 1000 mg/g or higher, or in patients who are unable to adhere to the recommended laboratory monitoring and management guidelines. Patients or their caregivers should be apprised of the signs and symptoms of glomerulonephritis and to seek medical attention if they occur, including edema, shortness of breath, coughing,hematuria, and decreased urination. In patients with UPCR of 2000 mg/g or higher, perform further evaluation for acute glomerulonephritis as clinically indicated.
