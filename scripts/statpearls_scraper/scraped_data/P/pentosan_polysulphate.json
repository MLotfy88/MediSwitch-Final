    "indications": "Pentosan polysulfate (PPS) is a semisynthetic pentasaccharide heparinoid with anticoagulant properties. It was initially used in the 1950s as a thrombolytic due to the ability of the molecule to bind the glycocalyx of circulating red blood cells.\n[1]\n[2]\nPPS is the only medication approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to treat interstitial cystitis (IC).\n[3]\n\nIC is characterized by bladder pain (suprapubic, pelvic, urethral, vaginal, or perineal) caused by filling and relieved by emptying with petechial bladder mucosal hemorrhages on endoscopy and decreased bladder compliance on urodynamics.\n[3]\nThis disease is very common, affecting over 1 million Americans, the vast majority of whom are female.\n[4]\nIn the bladder, PPS is postulated to bind to the urothelium and replace disrupted glycosaminoglycans to protect the urothelium.\n[4]\nLess frequently, PPS is used for other indications, including irritable bowel syndrome, pelvic pain syndrome, and inner bladder wall cracks.\n[5]\nThe recommended dosage for PPS is 100 mg, 3 times a day.\n[4]\n\nTwenty-two years after its approval as a second-line agent for interstitial cystitis, a 6-patient case series described a progressive maculopathy associated with long-term use of the drug, an association that researchers have demonstrated and characterized multiple times.\n[4]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]",
    "mechanism": "Studies agree that the duration of PPS use, which correlates strongly with cumulative exposure to PPS, might be the most important risk factor for developing PPSM.\n[9]\n[10]\nAlthough PPSM has been seen in a patient with only 325 g and 2.25 years of exposure, most patients develop the disease years later.\n[11]\nSpecifically, a 2022 review averaging 9 studies calculated an average of 15.0 ± 5.7 years of exposure and a cumulative exposure of 1824 ± 1042 g, data which were corroborated in a subsequent large review.\n[12]\nOne of these studies noted a prevalence of toxicity of 16% among all affected patients versus a prevalence of 40% in those with cumulative dosages greater than 1000 g and 55% in those with a cumulative dose greater than 1500 g.\n[5]\n\nThese studies included patients from the time of PPSM diagnosis, not when they become symptomatic, so the onset of the disease is likely earlier.\n[4]\nWhen these patients were categorized by disease severity, there was an association between severity, duration of use, and cumulative dose, but not a daily dose of PPS.\n[5]\nThis association was also borne out in a large-scale study of insurance records, which showed an increased risk of PPSM among those users with more than 3 years of exposure to PPS compared with those with less than 3 years (hazard ratio of 9.5 vs 2.2).\n[10]\n\nThe daily dose and dose per unit of body weight are also not infrequently discussed as potential enablers of toxicity. One study found a higher mean daily dose among affected patients (445 vs 302 g).\n[9]\nThis finding has been corroborated in a survey study in which patients on 100 mg of PPS for 15 years were less likely to report maculopathy than the patients on 500 mg for a median intake of 5 years.\n[13]\nThe BMI of affected patients may be on the upper end of normal (24.6 kg/m) but has also been reported to be closer to the middle of the normal range (23.2 kg/m).\n[12]\n[14]",
    "monitoring": "Anterior segment examination is predominantly within normal limits for patients of this age.\n[5]\nFundus examination findings can be subtle and are primarily characterized as densely-packed bilateral paracentral hyperpigmented spots with surrounding yellow subretinal deposits with mottled RPE atrophy.\n[11]\n[33]\nMost of these spots are bilateral (97.3%) and confined to the posterior pole; however, wide-field imaging has also shown that 36% of patients had changes in the peripheral retina.\n[6]\n[12]\n[6]\n\nThe pattern is most striking on autofluorescence, which shows a typically well-circumscribed area of small, densely-packed hyper- and hypoautofluorescent spots.\n[11]\n[34]\nFundus autofluorescence (FAF) also discloses that 100% of eyes have a peripapillary hypoautofluorescent halo.\n[5]\n\nOn OCT, the colocalized yellowish pigment on fundus examination and the hyperautofluorescent lesions correspond to nodular RPE abnormalities and excrescences, which cast a shadow onto the underlying choroid (thereby differentiating them from drusen).\n[4]\n[11]\nWith time, these areas of excrescences and conglomerations change; specifically, overlying retinal layers will progressively thin, and there will be associated RPE atrophy.\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[11]\nCystoid macular edema (CME) occurs less frequently (between 4.2% and 12.9% of patients), as do neovascular membranes (1.4% to 17.6% of patients) and subfoveal vitelliform deposits.\n[35]\n\nNear-infrared reflectance (NIR), co-acquired with OCT, is often highly effective in showing the characteristic lesions in mild forms of the disease, including when FAF findings are inconclusive.\n[12]\nSpecifically, similar symmetrical hyperreflectant spots centered on the macula may be seen on NIR, whereas the FAF does not show these lesions. This difference may be due to NIR utilizing a longer wavelength of light (820 nm) than FAF (480 nm), penetrating more avidly into deeper retinal layers.\n[36]\nThe critical implication of this finding is that patients who are unable to access a center with fundus autofluorescence capabilities can still be screened if OCT is used.\n\nOn OCT-A, PPSM has many characteristic findings that may hint at the ultimate pathophysiology of the disease. PPSM is associated with abnormal foveal avascular zone (FAZ) configurations and decreased choriocapillaris perfusion in patients with later stages of the disease. These areas of decreased perfusion were shown to have a flow void average of 54%, compared with 14% in non-PPSM patients, and they correspond to areas of outer retinal atrophy.\n[5]\n[7]\n\nA separate analysis of the stroma on OCT-A found a decreased stromal choroidal area with a preserved stromal luminal area, yielding an increased choroidal vascularity index. These changes on OCT-A may be utilized to detect patients with forme fruste PPSM, as increased flow voids were found in 15 patients with greater than 1000 g of PPS exposure who had no other findings on retinal imaging.\n[28]\nFurther, it can help differentiate the condition from AMD, in which the choroidal vascularity index increases.\n[5]\nImportantly, OCT-A can also identify patients with choroidal neovascular membranes.\n[12]\n[37]\n\nWhen tested on electroretinography (ERG), patients can have nonspecific responses ranging from normal to mild attenuation of amplitude in code and rod responses with variable delay in response.\n[38]\nSimilarly, multifocal ERG will reflect mild-to-severe attenuation of response amplitude.\n[6]\n[34]\nElectro-oculograms reflect predominantly normal Arden ratios, though dark adaptometry is frequently found to be prolonged.\n[7]\n[11]\n[32]\n\nMultiple studies have included genetic testing for patients with PPSM to rule out other maculopathies. Although none have found clear associations, some wonder if there may be a genetic predisposition to having a more severe phenotype.\n[5]\n[7]\n[39]\nFor example, a patient in one study had an\nNPHP1\nmutation and severe phenotype, and another had a family history of AMD and a variant of undetermined significance in the\nRP1\ngene who presented with geographic atrophy and count fingers vision.\n[7]\n[9]\nOther studies have reported multiple variants of uncertain significance, including\nABCA4\n,\nADAM9\n,\nIMPG2\n,\nMPZ\n, and\nTIMP3\n.\n[6]\n\nBased on these results, Barnes and colleagues proposed 6 diagnostic criteria:\n[33]\n\nMacular hyperpigmented spots with yellow-orange deposits and patchy RPE atrophy on fundus photography\nDensely packed clusters of hyper- and hypoautofluorescent areas within the posterior pole on FAF\nFocal thickening of the RPE with hyperreflectance on NIR\nThe peripapillary hypoautofluorescent halo\nMaximum size of the hyperautofluorescent spots of 2 venule widths.\nAbsence of typical drusen\n\nFurther, based on their work, Wang and colleagues proposed the following guidelines for defining disease severity:\n[9]\n\nMild:\nSpeckled pattern on FAF without well-demarcated atrophic lesions on FAF and no evidence of complete RPE and outer retinal atrophy\nModerate:\nWell-demarcated, nummular, and colocalized lesions with RPE and outer retinal atrophy; no central foveal involvement\nSevere:\nWell-demarcated lesions with associated hypoautofluorescent atrophy with RPE and outer retinal atrophy, which involves the central fovea\n\nHanif and colleagues proposed a similar classification of severity:\n[6]\n\nDisease within the vascular arcades and without areas of atrophy\nDisease extending to the vascular arcades but not more than 2  disc diameters beyond or the presence of noncentral atrophy.\nDisease that extends more than 2  disc diameters beyond the temporal arcades or the presence of central foveal atrophy.\n\nAdditionally, Wang et al found a correlation between disease severity and cumulative dosage; however, the sample size was too small to draw any conclusions.\n[5]",
    "administration": "There is no known treatment for PPSM; therefore, primary prevention is imperative with medication avoidance or using the lowest effective dose if necessary. The sight-threatening sequelae of PPSM can be treated with common medications already used to address those conditions. For example, patients with cystoid macular edema have been successfully treated with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs, and patients with choroidal neovascular membranes have been treated with intravitreal anti-VEGF medications.\n[37]",
    "adverse_effects": "In addition to decreased visual acuity from RPE atrophy, the sight-threatening sequelae of PPSM include CME, subfoveal vitelliform deposits, and macular neovascular membranes.\n[12]\n[35]\n[37]\n[46]"
