      "text": "Fungal infection of the nail\nUsually affects toenails, although fingernails can be affected\n[1]\nGenerally affects multiple nails at once, and usually concurrent tinea pedis is present\n[2]\nMay be caused by dermatophytes (most common), non-dermatophyte, or candida fungal species",
