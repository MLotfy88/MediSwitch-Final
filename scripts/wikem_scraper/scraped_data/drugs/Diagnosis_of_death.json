      "text": "The definition or classification of death can also change based on the setting the patient is present in as well. For example in a mass casualty setting triaging a patient as \"black\" or dead, is done purely on the basis of responsiveness and spontaneous circulation and ventilation.\n[1]\nNote there is a distinction between pronouncing and\ncertifying\ndeath. The former means assessing the patient and diagnosing death, whereas certifying death typically involves stating the\ncause\nof death as well.",
