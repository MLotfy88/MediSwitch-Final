It is primarily used for the treatment of respiratory, enteric and genitourinary infections and may be used instead of other macrolides for some sexually transmitted and enteric infections. It is structurally related to erythromycin [A174169].

Azithromycin [9-deoxo-9a-aza-9a-methyl-9a-homoerythromycin] is a part of the _azalide_ subclass of macrolides, and contains a 15-membered ring, with a methyl-substituted nitrogen instead of a carbonyl group at the 9a position on the aglycone ring, which allows for the prevention of its metabolism. This differentiates azithromycin from other types of macrolides [A174175].

In March 2020, a small study was funded by the French government to investigate the treatment of COVID-19 with a combination of azithromycin and the anti-malaria drug [hydroxychloroquine]. The results were positive, all patients taking the combination were virologically cured within 6 days of treatment, however, larger studies are required.[A192546]','["J01RA07", "S01AA26", "J01FA10"]','[]'),(16986,'Cyanocobalamine 1000 mcg inj.','سيانوكوبالامين 1000مكجم حقن','1','','Vitamin b','Cyanocobalamine','Arab drug company.','Inj','حقن','1000 mcg','1','','','','',1214,'2022-06-17',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(16987,'Cybreak massage spray 100 ml','سايبريك مساج سبراي 100 مل','85','70','Massage','Menthol+eucalyptus+thyme oil+tea tree oil+ginkgo biloba+camphor+clove+peppermint','Egyptian co. for cosmetics > kmt pharma','Spray','بخاخ','100 ml','1','مساج لآلام العظام والعضلات','spray with natural ingredients to reduce body stress.','','',11244,'2025-01-03',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(16988,'Cycloflex 5 mg 20 f.c. tablets','سيكلوفلكس 5 مجم 20 قرص','40','','Cns.analgesic.skeletal muscle relaxant','Cyclobenzaprine','Egpi > salix pharma','Tablet','أقراص','5 mg','2','','','6225000299351','',6216,'2023-05-14',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Cyclobenzaprine, a centrally-acting muscle relaxant, was first synthesized in 1961[A185039] and has been available for human use since 1977.[A184982] It was initially studied for use as antidepressant given its structural similarity to tricyclic antidepressants - it differs from [Amitriptyline] by only a single double bond.[A185039,A184982] Since its approval, it has remained relatively popular as an adjunctive, short-term treatment for acute skeletal muscle spasms secondary to musculoskeletal injury.','["M03BX08"]','[]'),(16989,'Cycloflex 5 mg 30 f.c. tablets','سيكلوفلكس 5 مجم 30 قرص','69','','Cns.analgesic.skeletal muscle relaxant','Cyclobenzaprine','Egpi > salix pharma','Tablet','أقراص','5 mg','3','مسكن ومهديء عصبي وباسط عضلات','','','',5546,'2023-05-14',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Cyclobenzaprine, a centrally-acting muscle relaxant, was first synthesized in 1961[A185039] and has been available for human use since 1977.[A184982] It was initially studied for use as antidepressant given its structural similarity to tricyclic antidepressants - it differs from [Amitriptyline] by only a single double bond.[A185039,A184982] Since its approval, it has remained relatively popular as an adjunctive, short-term treatment for acute skeletal muscle spasms secondary to musculoskeletal injury.','["M03BX08"]','[]'),(16990,'Immunizzare kids syrup 120 ml','اميونيزار كيدز شراب 120 مل','380','350','Immunity booster','Epicor+vitamin c+vitamin d+zinc','Rx healthcare','Syrup','شراب','120 ml','1','','','','',1224,'2024-11-08',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(16993,'Aaa','ششش','6','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',766,'2022-07-19',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(16997,'Cyclotrone 200mg 30 soft gelatin caps.','سيكلوترون 200 مجم 30 كبسولة','36','','Progesterone supplement','Progesterone','Technopharm > adwia','Cap','كبسولة','200mg','3','','indication for progesterone supplementation or replacement as part of an assisted reproductive technology (art) treatment for infertile women with progesterone deficiency and for the treatment of secondary amenorrhea. also used for the reduction of the in','','',890,'2022-07-24',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Progesterone is a hormone that occurs naturally in females, and is essential for endometrial receptivity, embryo implantation, and the successful establishment of pregnancy.

Hepatitis C is an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Daclatasvir was the first drug with demonstrated safety and therapeutic efficacy in treating HCV genotype 3 without the need for co-administration of interferon or [DB00811]. It exerts its antiviral action by preventing RNA replication and virion assembly via binding to NS5A, a nonstructural phosphoprotein encoded by HCV. Binding to the N-terminus of the D1 domain of NS5A prevents its interaction with host cell proteins and membranes required for virion replication complex assembly. Daclatasvir is shown to target both the cis- and trans-acting functions of NS5A and disrupts the function of new HCV replication complexes by modulating the NS5A phosphorylation status [A19640]. The most common critical NS5A amino acid substitutions that led to reduced susceptibility to daclatasvir therapy occured at position Q30 (Q30H/K/R) and M28 in genotype 1a patients and Y93H in genotype 3 patients. 

According to 2017 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), 60mg of daclatasvir is recommended with 400mg [DB08934] for genotype 1a/b patients with or without cirrhosis as second-line therapy. The same dosing regimen can be used as first-line therapy in patients with genotype 3 without cirrhosis and second-line therapy in genotype 3 patients with compensated cirrhosis. Combination therapies that include daclatasir can be used for challenging-to-treat patients who have HIV-1 coinfection, advanced cirrhosis, or post-liver transplant recurrence of HCV [L863]. The therapy is intended to cure or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR12), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626].

It is marketed under the name DAKLINZA and is contained in daily oral tablets as the hydrochloride salt form . Hepatitis C is an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Daclatasvir was the first drug with demonstrated safety and therapeutic efficacy in treating HCV genotype 3 without the need for co-administration of interferon or [DB00811]. It exerts its antiviral action by preventing RNA replication and virion assembly via binding to NS5A, a nonstructural phosphoprotein encoded by HCV. Binding to the N-terminus of the D1 domain of NS5A prevents its interaction with host cell proteins and membranes required for virion replication complex assembly. Daclatasvir is shown to target both the cis- and trans-acting functions of NS5A and disrupts the function of new HCV replication complexes by modulating the NS5A phosphorylation status [A19640]. The most common critical NS5A amino acid substitutions that led to reduced susceptibility to daclatasvir therapy occured at position Q30 (Q30H/K/R) and M28 in genotype 1a patients and Y93H in genotype 3 patients. 

According to 2017 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), 60mg of daclatasvir is recommended with 400mg [DB08934] for genotype 1a/b patients with or without cirrhosis as second-line therapy. The same dosing regimen can be used as first-line therapy in patients with genotype 3 without cirrhosis and second-line therapy in genotype 3 patients with compensated cirrhosis. Combination therapies that include daclatasir can be used for challenging-to-treat patients who have HIV-1 coinfection, advanced cirrhosis, or post-liver transplant recurrence of HCV [L863]. The therapy is intended to cure or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR12), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626]. 

Daclatasvir was FDA-approved in July 2015 for use with [DB08934] (Sovaldi) with or without [DB00811] to treat HCV genotype 1 and 3 infections. The SVR12 in HCV genotype 1a-infected treatment-naïve subjects without and with cirrhosis undergoing daclatasvir and [DB08934] therapy were 88% and 99%, respectively [FDA Label].

Appropriate levels of vitamin D must be upheld in the body in order to maintain calcium and phosphorus levels in a healthy physiologic range to sustain a variety of metabolic functions, transcription regulation, and bone metabolism [A223, L5689, L1782, L5771, F4027, F4042, F4048].

However, it has a negligible effect on altering the development and progression of breast cancer itself.[label] The most common causes of osteoporosis include postmenopausal deficiency of estrogen and age-related deterioration in bone homeostasis. Due to the risk of bone fractures that may lead to morbidities and reduced quality of life, the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women with the use of therapeutic agents in addition to concurrent therapies is critical. Due to the decline in estrogen levels in postmenopausal osteoporosis, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), such as estradiol, has been used to ameliorate the condition. However, due to the off-target actions by HRT, newer non-hormonal agents such as raloxifene and [tamoxifen] have been developed to reduce adverse events through selective pharmacological actions on tissue-specific therapeutic targets.[T28]

The main effects of raloxifene are to preserve the bone mineral density and decrease the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Compared to estrogen and tamoxifen, raloxifene was not associated with an increased risk of uterine cancer and it does not cause endometrial proliferation.[A716] Although rare, there was an increased risk of venous thromboembolism during clinical trials of postmenopausal women receiving raloxifene. In addition, a clinical study consisting of postmenopausal women with documented coronary heart disease or at increased risk for coronary events showed an increased risk for fatal stroke with raloxifene therapy compared to placebo.[label] It is strongly advised that the risk-benefit ratio is considered before starting raloxifene therapy in women at risk of thromboembolic disease or strokes, such as the prior history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, or cigarette smoking.[label]','["G03XC01"]','[]'),(17148,'Debosteobone 4 f.c. tab.','ديبوستيوبون 4 اقراص','60','','Osteoporosis.bisphosphonates.plus vitamin d','Alendronate+vitamin d3','Debeiky','Tab','أقراص','','1','','it is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. in postmenopausal women it increases bone mass and reduces the incidence of fractures including those of the hip and spine (vertebral compression fractures). alendronate sodium is','6224000873356','',983,'2022-07-15',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17149,'Debridat 200mg 20 tab','ديبريدات 200مجم 20 قرص','24','','Antimuscarinic.irritable bowel syndrome','Trimebutine','Pfizer','Tab','أقراص','200mg','2','ارتجاع المريء وحرقان المعدة.','','6221180000565','',2941,'2022-12-04',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'A03AA05',NULL),(17152,'Chartoreg co 80 / 5 mg 28 tabs.','شارتوريج كو 80/5مجم 28 قرص','192','146','Antihypertensive.angiotensin blocker','Telmisartan+amlodipine','Utopia','Tab','أقراص','5 mg','2','علاج ارتفاع ضغط الدم','','','',1285,'2025-06-11',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17153,'Decancit s.r 20 f.c.tab','ديكانست اس ار 20 قرص','42','42','Antihistamine.antiallergy.combined with vasoconstrictor agent','Cetirizine+pseudoephedrine','Multi-apex','Tab','أقراص','','2','علاج التهاب الجيوب الأنفية.','is a combination of cetirizine an antihistamine that reduces the natural chemical histamine in the body and pseudoephedrine a decongestant that shrinks blood vessels in the nasal passages. it is used to treat cold or allergy symptoms such as nasal and sin','6223003204792','',30257,'2024-08-22',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17154,'Decapeptyl 0.1mg/ml 7 prefilled syringe','ديكابيبتيل 0.1مجم/مل 7 سرنجات معبأة','1,400','1050','Gnrh agonist','Triptorelin acetate','Ferring pharmaceuticals > multipharma','Cap','كبسولة','0.1mg','7','علاج سرطان البروستاتا.','about triptorelin gnrh agonist synthetic lh releasing hormone (lhrh) analog antineoplastic. mechanism of action of triptorelin triptorelin is an gnrh agonist. hypothalamus releases lhrh to the pituitary gland. the gland releases luteinizing hormone to the','7640128544944','',17068,'2025-11-11',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Triptorelin is a synthetic decapeptide agonist analog of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH).

More specifically, folic acid is required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. Folic acid is particularly important during phases of rapid cell division, such as infancy, pregnancy, and erythropoiesis, and plays a protective factor in the development of cancer. As humans are unable to synthesize folic acid endogenously, diet and supplementation is necessary to prevent deficiencies. For example, folic acid is present in green vegetables, beans, avocado, and some fruits.[L5744]

In order to function within the body, folic acid must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted by anti-metabolite therapies such as [DB00563] as they function as DHFR inhibitors to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, and therefore prevent the formation of DHF and THF. When used in high doses such as for cancer therapy, or in low doses such as for Rheumatoid Arthritis or psoriasis, [DB00563] impedes the body''s ability to create folic acid. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects. As a result, supplementation with 1-5mg of folic acid is recommended to prevent deficiency and a number of side effects associated with MTX therapy including mouth ulcers and gastrointestinal irritation. [DB00650] (also known as folinic acid) supplementation is typically used for high-dose MTX regimens for the treatment of cancer. Levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF) and are able to bypass DHFR reduction to act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF.

There are also several antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) that are associated with reduced serum and red blood cell folate, including [DB00564] (CBZ), [DB00252] (PHT), or barbiturates.[A37004] Folic acid is therefore often provided as supplementation to individuals using these medications, particularly to women of child-bearing age. 

Inadequate folate levels can result in a number of health concerns including cardiovascular disease, megaloblastic anemias, cognitive deficiencies, and neural tube defects (NTDs). Folic acid is typically supplemented during pregnancy to prevent the development of NTDs and in individuals with alcoholism to prevent the development of neurological disorders, for example.','["B03AE02", "V04CX02", "B03BB01", "B03AE01", "B03BB51"]','[]'),(17172,'Deconadal 10 mg 21 f.c. tabs.','ديكونادال 10مجم 21 قرص','108','82.5','Antihyperlipidemic.statins','Rosuvastatin','Copad pharma','Tab','أقراص','10 mg','3','خافض للكوليسترول ودهون الدم','','6224000394684','',4226,'2025-06-04',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Rosuvastatin, also known as the brand name product Crestor, is a lipid-lowering drug that belongs to the statin class of medications, which are used to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and manage elevated lipid levels by inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Rosuvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [simvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] This is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than [atorvastatin]''s effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial[A181427] concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.

Rosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]','["C10BX10", "C10BX05", "C10BX07", "C10AA07", "A10BH52", "G01AE10", "C10BX13", "C10BX09", "C10BA09", "C10BX16", "C10BX17", "C10BX14", "C10BA06"]','[]');

More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Rosuvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [simvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] This is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than [atorvastatin]''s effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial[A181427] concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.

It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infections along with other antibiotics including [amoxicillin], [clarithromycin], and [metronidazole], for example.[A177271][F4498] Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [omeprazole], [esomeprazole], [lansoprazole], [dexlansoprazole], and [rabeprazole].

Pantoprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cell. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of pantoprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, pantoprazole''s duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as pantoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]

PPIs such as pantoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]

Pantoprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing as rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as pantoprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion.[A177574]','["A02BD04", "A02BD11", "A02BC02"]','[]'),(17216,'Delpedox 400mg/5ml pd. for oral susp. 100ml','ديلبيدوكس 400 مجم / 5 مل معلق 100 مل','10','','Penicillins.monocomponent','Amoxicillin','Delta pharma','Susp','معلق','400mg','1','','(indications): is a penicillin-like beta-lactam antibiotic. it is used to treat bacterial infections caused by susceptible microorganisms. it prevents the bacterial growth and is used in the treatment of a number of infections such as pneumonia bronchitis','6223004000232','',811,'2022-12-04',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Amoxicillin, or BRL-2333, is a penicillin G derivative first described in the literature in 1972.[A190648] Amoxicillin has similar activity to [penicillin] and [ampicillin], but leads to higher serum concentrations than ampicillin.[A190648]

Venlafaxine has been used as a first-line treatment for MDD, GAD, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder in Canada for many years. It was also considered a second-line treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).[A177226,A177235] Venlafaxine was also investigated in off-label uses for the prophylaxis of migraine headaches,[A413,A177229] for reduction of vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause,[A177238] and for the management of neuropathic pain (although there is only minimal evidence of efficacy for this condition).[A177232]','["N06AX16"]','[]'),(17237,'Rebamucaulc 100 mg 20 f.c.tabs.','ريباميوكالس 100 مجم 20 قرص','48','','Peptic ulcer','Rebamipide','Pharma cure','Tab','أقراص','100 mg','2','','','6224009003709','',1299,'2022-09-23',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'A02BX14',NULL),(17238,'Delzosin 600mg 6 f.c. tabs.','دلزوسين 600مجم 6 اقراص','104','72','Antibiotic.macrolide','Azithromycin','Delta pharma','Tab','أقراص','600mg','2','','','6221163015838','',1178,'2024-10-20',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Azithromycin is a broad-spectrum macrolide antibiotic with a long half-life and a high degree of tissue penetration [A174172].

It is primarily used for the treatment of respiratory, enteric and genitourinary infections and may be used instead of other macrolides for some sexually transmitted and enteric infections. It is structurally related to erythromycin [A174169].

Azithromycin [9-deoxo-9a-aza-9a-methyl-9a-homoerythromycin] is a part of the _azalide_ subclass of macrolides, and contains a 15-membered ring, with a methyl-substituted nitrogen instead of a carbonyl group at the 9a position on the aglycone ring, which allows for the prevention of its metabolism. This differentiates azithromycin from other types of macrolides [A174175].

In March 2020, a small study was funded by the French government to investigate the treatment of COVID-19 with a combination of azithromycin and the anti-malaria drug [hydroxychloroquine]. The results were positive, all patients taking the combination were virologically cured within 6 days of treatment, however, larger studies are required.[A192546]','["J01RA07", "S01AA26", "J01FA10"]','[]'),(17239,'Demafight 5 mg 30 scored tabs','ديمافايت 5مجم 30 قرص','96','78','Diuretic','Metolazone','International drug agency (idi) > novell pharma','Tab','أقراص','5 mg','3','مدر للبول','','6223004072093','',4029,'2025-10-19',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'A quinazoline-sulfonamide that is considered a thiazide-like diuretic which is long-acting so useful in chronic renal failure.

In particular, lidocaine''s principal mode of action in acting as a local anesthetic that numbs the sensations of tissues means the agent is indicated for facilitating local anesthesia for a large variety of surgical procedures [F4349, L5930, L5948]. It ultimately elicits its numbing activity by blocking sodium channels so that the neurons of local tissues that have the medication applied on are transiently incapable of signaling the brain regarding sensations [F4349, L5930, L5948]. In doing so, however, it can block or decrease muscle contractile, resulting in effects like vasodilation, hypotension, and irregular heart rate, among others [F4349, L5930, L5948]. As a result, lidocaine is also considered a class Ib anti-arrhythmic agent [L5930, L5948, F4468]. Nevertheless, lidocaine''s local anesthetic action sees its use in many medical situations or circumstances that may benefit from its action, including the treatment of premature ejaculation [A177625].

Structurally, ergocalciferol differs from cholecalciferol in that it possesses a double bond between C22 and C23 and has an additional methyl group at C24 [L5689]. Finally, ergocalciferol is pharmacologically less potent than cholecalciferol, which makes vitamin D3 the preferred agent for medical use [L5689].

Appropriate levels of vitamin D must be upheld in the body in order to maintain calcium and phosphorus levels in a healthy physiologic range to sustain a variety of metabolic functions, transcription regulation, and bone metabolism [A223, L5689, L1782, L5771, F4027, F4042, F4048].

Interestingly, researchers have identified higher VEGF expression in patients with COVID-19, which may contribute to lung pathologies including acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI).[L12699] As such, bevacizumab is being investigated for the treatment of lung complications associated with severe cases of COVID-19.[L12699]','["L01FG01", "S01LA08"]','[]'),(17311,'Derma soft plus cream 100 gm','ديرما سوفت بلس كريم 100جم','180','156','Soothing topical','Collagen+wheatgerm oil+vit.e+aloe vera+allantoin+paraffin oil+glycerin+panthenol+dimethicon+chamomil','Mash premiere','Cream','كريم','100 gm','1','ترطيب الجلد -- علاج تشقق الجلد الحاد -- تقليل اللالتهابات والاحمرار','rejuvenating moisturizer with phyto collagen it is rapidly absorbed by skin layers where dryness exist and helps to soften the dry skin.','6222001404241','',1984,'2024-02-08',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17312,'Derma v10 24/7 body lotion 200 ml','ديرما في 10 24/7 غسول للجسم 200 مل','120','','Moisturizing topicals','Almond oil+shea butter','Healthpoint ltd > paxton','Lotion','لوشن','200 ml','1','','for dry skin. rapid skin hydration. with almond oil & shea butter. softens hydrates & soothes skin. ** directions: apply liberally & as often as necessary. use twice daily for best results.','','',839,'2022-08-01',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17313,'Top hair lotion 120 ml','توب هير لوشن 120 مل','180','','Hair care','Caffeine+argan oil+ginseng+wheat germ oil+vitamin e+biotin+garlic oil+jojoba oil+castor oil+olive oil+panthenol','Egyptian co. for cosmetics > infinity pharm','Lotion','لوشن','120 ml','1','','','','',837,'2022-08-12',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17314,'Lucente lumini foam cleanser 200 ml','لوسينت لوميني فوم كلينزر 200 مل','270','','Skin care','D-panthenol+pentavitin+nanoactive salicylic acid+liquorice extract+arbutin+ascorbyl palmitate+glutathione','Macro group pharmaceuticals','Cleanser','منظف','200 ml','1','','','','',673,'2022-08-12',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17315,'Dermabiotic 10g topical powder','ديرمابيوتيك 10جم بودرة','5','','Antibiotic','Bacitracin+neomycin','Pharco','Powder','بودرة','','1','','mechanism of action of bacitracin bacitracin is an antibiotic produced by the strain of bacillus subtilis. it acts by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis. it is active against a variety of gram positive and a few gram negative organisms. mechanism of','','',1221,'2022-07-08',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'D06AX05',NULL),(17316,'Dermabiotic 6g topical powder','ديرمابيوتك6جم بودر موضعي','4','','Antibiotic','Bacitracin+neomycin','Pharco','Powder','بودرة','','1','','mechanism of action of bacitracin bacitracin is an antibiotic produced by the strain of bacillus subtilis. it acts by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis. it is active against a variety of gram positive and a few gram negative organisms. mechanism of','','',785,'2022-07-26',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'D06AX05',NULL),(17317,'Dermabiotic oint. 20 gm','ديرمابيوتيك مرهم 20 جم','5','','Antibiotic topical','Bacitracin+neomycin','Pharco','Oint','مرهم','20 gm','1','','mechanism of action of bacitracin bacitracin is an antibiotic produced by the strain of bacillus subtilis. it acts by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis. it is active against a variety of gram positive and a few gram negative organisms. mechanism of','','',1051,'2022-07-18',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'D06AX05',NULL);

Both the endogenous form of vitamin D (that results from 7-dehydrocholesterol transformation), vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), and the plant-derived form, vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol), are considered the main forms of vitamin d and are found in various types of food for daily intake [L5689]. Structurally, ergocalciferol differs from cholecalciferol in that it possesses a double bond between C22 and C23 and has an additional methyl group at C24 [L5689]. Finally, ergocalciferol is pharmacologically less potent than cholecalciferol, which makes vitamin D3 the preferred agent for medical use [L5689].

Appropriate levels of vitamin D must be upheld in the body in order to maintain calcium and phosphorus levels in a healthy physiologic range to sustain a variety of metabolic functions, transcription regulation, and bone metabolism [A223, L5689, L1782, L5771, F4027, F4042, F4048].

reflux disease (GERD) and erosive esophagitis. Dexlansoprazole is the R-enantiomer of [DB00448], which is composed of a racemic mixture of the R- and S-enantiomers. Compared to the older generation of PPIs (which includes [DB00213], [DB00338], and [DB00448]) [A178084], dexlansoprazole MR has a unique pharmacokinetic profile due to its delayed-release and dual-delivery release system. The active ingredient is released in two phases at different pH values and at different time points, resulting in two peak concentrations in the blood; 25% of the dose is released at pH 5.5 in the proximal duodenum, while the remaining 75% is released at pH 6.75 in the distal small intestine [A19567]. As a result, dexlansoprazole has a peak concentration within 1-2 hours after dosing and another within 4-5 hours [FDA Label]. Dexlansoprazole''s unique pharmacokinetics addresses limitations of the older generation PPIs including short plasma half-life, break-through symptoms, and need for meal-associated dosing [A19568]. These characteristics make dexlansoprazole a good option for people who struggle with adherence and strict dosage timing before meals[A178087, A19566]. 

Dexlansoprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects in the same way as other drugs in the PPI family by inhibiting the final step in gastric acid production. Dexlansoprazole targets the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme, which is involved in the secretion of hydrochloric acid through the exchange of H+ ions from the cytoplasm for K+ ions. Normally functioning (H+, K+)-ATPase stimulates hydrochloric acid secretion into the gastric lumen thereby increasing stomach acidity and lowering pH. Once absorbed into circulation, dexlansoprazole covalently binds to the sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells, which leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion. Despite dexlansoprazole''s unique pharmacokinetic profile, efficacy in management of GERD symptoms is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [DB00338], [DB00736], [DB00448], [DB00213], and [DB01129].

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as dexlansoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life [A177571]. PPIs such as dexlansoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes [A177577, A177580]. 

Dexlansoprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing as rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as dexlansoprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion [A177574].','["A02BC06"]','[]'),(17439,'Dexiclave 1 gm 10 f.c. tabs','ديكسيكلاف 1 جم 5 اقراص','39','','Penicillins.penicillin with b-lactamase inhibitor','Amoxicillin+clavulanic acid','Rameda > novell pharma','Tab','أقراص','1 gm','1','','','','',1527,'2022-07-24',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17440,'Aaa','ششش','118','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',747,'2022-09-23',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17441,'Dexiclave 312.5mg/5ml susp. 60 ml','ديكسيكلاف 312.5 مجم / 5 مل معلق 60 مل','19','','Penicillins.penicillin with b-lactamase inhibitor','Amoxicillin+clavulanic acid','Rameda > novell pharma','Susp','معلق','312.5mg','1','','amoxicillin is an analog of ampicillin derived from the basic penicillin nucleus 6-aminopenicillanic acid clavulanic acid is produced by the fermentation of streptomyces clavuligerus. it is a beta-lactam structurally related to the penicillins and possess','','',896,'2022-07-14',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17442,'Aaa','ششش','112','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',694,'2022-09-23',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17443,'Dexiclave 375 mg 10 f.c. tabs.','ديكسيكلاف 375 مجم 10 اقراص','22','','Penicillins.penicillin with b-lactamase inhibitor','Amoxicillin+clavulanic acid','Rameda > novell pharma','Tab','أقراص','375 mg','1','','amoxicillin is an analog of ampicillin derived from the basic penicillin nucleus 6-aminopenicillanic acid clavulanic acid is produced by the fermentation of streptomyces clavuligerus. it is a beta-lactam structurally related to the penicillins and possess','','',948,'2022-07-24',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17444,'Aaa','ششش','121','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',741,'2022-09-23',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17445,'Dexiclave 457mg/5ml susp. 60 ml','ديكسيكلاف 457 مجم / 5 مل معلق 60 مل','28','','Penicillins.penicillin with b-lactamase inhibitor','Amoxicillin+clavulanic acid','Rameda > novell pharma','Susp','معلق','457mg','1','','amoxicillin is an analog of ampicillin derived from the basic penicillin nucleus 6-aminopenicillanic acid clavulanic acid is produced by the fermentation of streptomyces clavuligerus. it is a beta-lactam structurally related to the penicillins and possess','','',840,'2022-07-24',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17447,'Dexiclave 625 mg 12 f.c. tabs.','ديكسكلاف 625 مجم 12 اقراص','38','','Penicillins.penicillin with b-lactamase inhibitor','Amoxicillin+clavulanic acid','Rameda > novell pharma','Tab','أقراص','625 mg','3','بنسلين بشري -- مضاد حيوي','amoxicillin is an analog of ampicillin derived from the basic penicillin nucleus 6-aminopenicillanic acid clavulanic acid is produced by the fermentation of streptomyces clavuligerus. it is a beta-lactam structurally related to the penicillins and possess','','',1246,'2022-07-24',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17448,'Dexilant 30 mg 14 caps.','ديكسيلانت 30 مجم 14 كبسولة','85','','Peptic ulcer.proton pump inhibitor','Dexlansoprazole','Takeda','Cap','كبسولة','30 mg','2','','dexlansoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (ppi) that is for the treatment of erosive esophagitis and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. it is similar in effectiveness to other ppis. dexlansoprazole is used to heal and maintain healing of erosive esophagi','','',1318,'2022-07-18',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Dexlansoprazole is a new generation proton pump inhibitor (PPI) used for the management of symptoms associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and erosive esophagitis. Dexlansoprazole is the R-enantiomer of [DB00448], which is composed of a racemic mixture of the R- and S-enantiomers. Compared to the older generation of PPIs (which includes [DB00213], [DB00338], and [DB00448]) [A178084], dexlansoprazole MR has a unique pharmacokinetic profile due to its delayed-release and dual-delivery release system. The active ingredient is released in two phases at different pH values and at different time points, resulting in two peak concentrations in the blood; 25% of the dose is released at pH 5.5 in the proximal duodenum, while the remaining 75% is released at pH 6.75 in the distal small intestine [A19567]. As a result, dexlansoprazole has a peak concentration within 1-2 hours after dosing and another within 4-5 hours [FDA Label]. Dexlansoprazole''s unique pharmacokinetics addresses limitations of the older generation PPIs including short plasma half-life, break-through symptoms, and need for meal-associated dosing [A19568]. These characteristics make dexlansoprazole a good option for people who struggle with adherence and strict dosage timing before meals[A178087, A19566]. 

Dexlansoprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects in the same way as other drugs in the PPI family by inhibiting the final step in gastric acid production. Dexlansoprazole targets the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme, which is involved in the secretion of hydrochloric acid through the exchange of H+ ions from the cytoplasm for K+ ions. Normally functioning (H+, K+)-ATPase stimulates hydrochloric acid secretion into the gastric lumen thereby increasing stomach acidity and lowering pH. Once absorbed into circulation, dexlansoprazole covalently binds to the sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells, which leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion. Despite dexlansoprazole''s unique pharmacokinetic profile, efficacy in management of GERD symptoms is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [DB00338], [DB00736], [DB00448], [DB00213], and [DB01129].

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread.

The first known inhibitor of SGLTs, phlorizin, was isolated from the bark of apple trees in 1835 and researched extensively into the 20th century, but was ultimately deemed inappropriate for clinical use given its lack of specificity and significant gastrointestinal side effects.[A203501] Attempts at overcoming these limitations first saw the development of O-glucoside analogs of phlorizin (e.g. [remogliflozin etabonate]), but these molecules proved relatively pharmacokinetically unstable. The development of C-glucoside phlorizin analogs remedied the issues observed in the previous generation, and led to the FDA approval of [canagliflozin] in 2013 and both [dapagliflozin] and empagliflozin in 2014.[A203501] As the most recently approved of the "flozin" drugs, empagliflozin carries the highest selectivity for SGLT2 over SGLT1 (approximately 2700-fold). Empagliflozin was further approved by the EMA in March 2022 and Health Canada in April 2022, making it the first and only approved treatment in Europe and Canada for adults with symptomatic chronic heart failure regardless of ejection fraction.[L40783,L13916]','["A10BD19", "A10BD20", "A10BK03", "A10BD27"]','[]'),(17528,'Diabetin plus 15/850mg 10 f.c.tab.','ديابيتين بلس 15/850 مجم 10 اقراص','9','','Anti-diabetic.sensitizers.combined glitazone +biguanide','Metformin+pioglitazone','Unipharma co.','Tab','أقراص','850mg','1','','','','',781,'2022-07-27',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17529,'Diabetless 4mg 10 scored tab.','ديابتلس 4 مجم 10 اقراص','6','','Anti-diabetic.secretagogues.sulfonylurea','Glimepiride','Bioriginal international group pharma egypt','Tab','أقراص','4mg','1','','indications : this medication is a sulfonylurea antidiabetic agent prescribed for type 2 diabetes. it works by causing the pancreas to produce insulin dosage : the recommended starting dose is 1-2 mg once daily with food.maximum: 2mg/day contraindications','','',702,'2022-07-21',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'First introduced in 1995, glimepiride is a member of the second-generation sulfonylurea (SU) drug class used for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to improve glycemic control.

It belongs to the meglitinide class of short-acting insulin secretagogues, which act by binding to β cells of the pancreas to stimulate insulin release. Nateglinide is an amino acid derivative that induces an early insulin response to meals decreasing postprandial blood glucose levels. It should only be taken with meals and meal-time doses should be skipped with any skipped meal. Approximately one month of therapy is required before a decrease in fasting blood glucose is seen. Meglitnides may have a neutral effect on weight or cause a slight increase in weight. The average weight gain caused by meglitinides appears to be lower than that caused by sulfonylureas and insulin and appears to occur only in those naïve to oral antidiabetic agents. Due to their mechanism of action, meglitinides may cause hypoglycemia although the risk is thought to be lower than that of sulfonylureas since their action is dependent on the presence of glucose. In addition to reducing postprandial and fasting blood glucose, meglitnides have been shown to decrease glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, which are reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control. Meglitinides appear to be more effective at lowering postprandial blood glucose than metformin, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones. Nateglinide is extensively metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine (83%) and feces (10%). The major metabolites possess less activity than the parent compound.

Empagliflozin was further approved by the EMA in March 2022 and Health Canada in April 2022, making it the first and only approved treatment in Europe and Canada for adults with symptomatic chronic heart failure regardless of ejection fraction.[L40783,L13916]','["A10BD19", "A10BD20", "A10BK03", "A10BD27"]','[]'),(17550,'Diadel cream 20 gm','دياديل كريم 20جم','45','','','Camphor+menthol+l-arginine+glycerin','Leader for cosmetics >','Cream','كريم','20 gm','1','ستخدم لعلاج والتخفيف من أعراض البواسير.الحد من التهاب منطقة الشرج.','','6280201379622','',1266,'2022-08-03',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17551,'Diaflozimet 10/1000 mg 30 ext. rel . f.c. tabs.','ديافلوزيميت 10/1000مجم 30 قرص ممتد المفعول','258','231.75','Anti-diabetic.secretagogues.sglt2 inhibitors','Dapagliflozin+metformin','Eva pharma','Tab','أقراص','1000 mg','3','لعلاج ارتفاع السكر بالدم','mechanism of action dapagliflozin inhibits subtype 2 of the sodium-glucose transport proteins (sglt2) which are responsible for at least 90% of the glucose reabsorption in the kidney. blocking this transporter mechanism causes blood glucose to be eliminat','6224009967049','',14318,'2023-09-09',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17552,'Diaflozimet 10/500 mg 30 ext. rel . f.c. tabs.','ديافلوزيميت 10/500مجم 30 قرص ممتد المفعول','258','231.75','Anti-diabetic.secretagogues.sglt2 inhibitors','Dapagliflozin+metformin','Eva pharma','Tab','أقراص','500 mg','3','لعلاج مرضى ارتفاع سكر الدم','mechanism of action dapagliflozin inhibits subtype 2 of the sodium-glucose transport proteins (sglt2) which are responsible for at least 90% of the glucose reabsorption in the kidney. blocking this transporter mechanism causes blood glucose to be eliminat','6224009967032','',1425,'2023-09-09',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17553,'Diaflozimet 5/1000 mg 30 ext. rel . f.c. tabs.','ديافلوزيميت 5/1000مجم 30 قرص ممتد المفعول','191','162','Anti-diabetic.secretagogues.sglt2 inhibitors','Dapagliflozin+metformin','Eva pharma','Tab','أقراص','1000 mg','3','لعلاج مرضى ارتفاع السكر بالدم','mechanism of action dapagliflozin inhibits subtype 2 of the sodium-glucose transport proteins (sglt2) which are responsible for at least 90% of the glucose reabsorption in the kidney. blocking this transporter mechanism causes blood glucose to be eliminat','6224009967025','',4310,'2023-09-09',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17554,'Diaflozimet 5/500 mg 30 ext. rel . f.c. tabs.','ديافلوزيميت 5/500مجم 30 قرص ممتد المفعول','191','162','Anti-diabetic.secretagogues.sglt2 inhibitors','Dapagliflozin+metformin','Eva pharma','Tab','أقراص','500 mg','3','لعلاج مرضى ارتفاع السكر بالدم','mechanism of action dapagliflozin inhibits subtype 2 of the sodium-glucose transport proteins (sglt2) which are responsible for at least 90% of the glucose reabsorption in the kidney. blocking this transporter mechanism causes blood glucose to be eliminat','6224007326794','http://www.evapharma.com/portfolio/Diaflozimet/',1900,'2024-12-04',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17555,'Dia-furyl 100mg 20 caps.','ديا-فيورل 100مجم 20 كبسولة','9','9','Antidiarrheal','Nifuroxazide','Borg','Cap','كبسولة','100mg','2','','indications infectious diarrhea in children and adults chronic colitis enterocolitis as an adjunctive treatment in combined therapy of intestinal dysbiosis. contraindication hypersensitivity to 5-nitrofurane derivatives and/or other components of the drug','6223002570232','',988,'2024-11-03',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'A07AX03',NULL),(17556,'Dia-furyl 200mg 10 caps.','ديا-فيوريل 200 مجم 10 كبسولات','17','8.5','Antidiarrheal','Nifuroxazide','Borg','Cap','كبسولة','200mg','1','','indications infectious diarrhea in children and adults chronic colitis enterocolitis as an adjunctive treatment in combined therapy of intestinal dysbiosis. contraindication hypersensitivity to 5-nitrofurane derivatives and/or other components of the drug','6223002570607','',948,'2024-11-03',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'A07AX03',NULL),(17557,'Aaa','ششش','9','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',734,'2022-09-24',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17558,'Like 50 gm moisturizing cream','لايك كريم مرطب 50 جم','75','','Moisturizing cream','Panthenol -

Diclofenac was first approved by the FDA in July 1988 under the trade name Voltaren, marketed by Novartis (previously Ciba-Geigy).[L7360]','["S01CC01", "S01BC03", "M01AB55", "M02AA15", "M01AB05", "D11AX18"]','[]'),(17624,'Aaa','ششش','24','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','0','','','','',689,'2022-11-14',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17625,'Aaa','ششش','18','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',796,'2022-11-14',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17626,'Aaa','ششش','42','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','0','','','','',632,'2022-11-14',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17627,'Di-ease syrup 120ml','داي ايز شراب 120 مل','8','','Digestive enzymes','Belladonna tincture+ginger tincture+papain','Pharopharma','Syrup','شراب','120ml','1','','','6221094011190','',1212,'2022-12-04',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17628,'Diet booster 20 tabs','دايت بوستر 20 قرص','53','','','','Egpi','Tab','أقراص','','1','','','9611001101712','',832,'2022-08-03',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17631,'Diet-sweet 350 tabs','دايت-سويت 350 قرص','74','60','Sweetener','Aspartame','Amriya','Tab','أقراص','','1','سكر دايت -- محلي للطعام -- يستخدم في عدم زيادة الوزن','','6221075010112','',3080,'2024-03-20',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17633,'Diety 300 tabs','دايتي 300 قرص','15','','Sweetener','Aspartame','Eva pharma','Tab','أقراص','','1','','','6223002450022','',716,'2022-12-04',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17634,'Diety 50 tabs','دايتي 50 قرص','4','','Sweetener','Aspartame','Eva pharma','Tab','أقراص','','1','','','6223002454303','',837,'2022-12-04',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17636,'Diflorutacine 500mg 30 f.c. tabs.','ديفلوروتاسين 500 مجم 30 قرص','47','','Vascular-protecting agent','Diosmin','Arab drug company.','Tab','أقراص','500mg','3','','','','',1734,'2022-07-15',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'C05CA03',NULL),(17638,'Aaa','ششش','98','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',765,'2022-09-10',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17639,'Aaa','ششش','60','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','0','','','','',610,'2022-09-10',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17640,'Aaa','ششش','95','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','0','','','','',675,'2022-09-10',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17641,'Aaa','ششش','95','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',717,'2022-09-10',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17642,'Diflunazole 25mg/5ml syrup 70ml','ديفلونازول 25 مجم / 5 مل شراب 70 مل','29','','Antifungals.triazoles','Fluconazole','Cid','Syrup','شراب','25mg','1','','about fluconazole a triazole derivative a board range antifungal. mechanism of action of fluconazole fluconazole is fungicidal or fungistatic depending on the drug concentrations. i t inhibits the conversion of lanosterol to 14 demethyl lanosterol by inhi','','',889,'2022-07-12',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Fluconazole, commonly known as _Diflucan_, is an antifungal drug used for the treatment of both systemic and superficial fungal infections in a variety of tissues.
