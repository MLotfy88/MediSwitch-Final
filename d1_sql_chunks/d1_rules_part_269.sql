Animal models suggest that renal prostaglandins may play a role in maintaining normal renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate during the development of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity, thus inhibition of their production by NSAIDs may worsen the renal damage. In premature infants, NSAIDs may increase the plasma concentrations of aminoglycosides. The proposed mechanism is decreased aminoglycoside clearance due to NSAID reduction of glomerular filtration rate.', 'DDInter', 1767317476, 'Whenever feasible, NSAID use should preferably be discontinued prior to initiating IV aminoglycoside therapy.
