The combat medic, corpsman, or PJ must consider this fact in his or her analgesic decision, but if the casualty is able to complain  of pain, then the TBI is likely not severe enough to preclude the use of\nketamine\nor OTFC.\nEye injury does not preclude the use of\nketamine\n. The risk of additional damage to the eye from using\nketamine\nis low and maximizing the casualty’s chance for survival takes precedence if the casualty is in shock or respiratory distress or at significant risk for either.\nKetamine\nmay be a useful adjunct to reduce the amount of opioids required to provide effective pain relief. It is safe to give ketamine to a casualty who has previously received morphine or OTFC. IV Ketamine should be given over 1 minute.\nIf respirations are noted to be reduced after using opioids or ketamine, provide ventilatory support with a bag-valve-mask or mouth-to-mask ventilations.\nPromethazine\n25mg IV/IM/IO every 6 hours may be given as needed for nausea or vomiting.\nReassess – reassess – reassess!",

      "text": "Facial burns, especially those that occur in closed spaces, may be associated with inhalation injury. Aggressively monitor airway status and oxygen saturation in such patients and consider early surgical airway for respiratory distress or oxygen desaturation.\nEstimate total body surface area (\nTBSA\n) burned to the nearest 10% using the\nRule of Nines\n.\nCover the burn area with dry, sterile dressings. For extensive burns (>20%), consider placing the casualty in the Heat-Reflective Shell or Blizzard Survival Blanket from the\nHypothermia\nPrevention Kit in order to both cover the burned areas and prevent hypothermia.\nFluid resuscitation (USAISR Rule of Ten)\nIf burns are greater than 20% of Total Body Surface Area, fluid resuscitation should be initiated as soon as IV/IO access is established. Resuscitation should be initiated with Lactated Ringer’s, normal saline, or Hextend. If Hextend is used, no more than 1000ml should be given, followed by Lactated Ringer’s or normal saline as needed.\nInitial IV/IO fluid rate is calculated as %\nTBSA\nx 10cc/hr for adults weighing 40-80 kg.\nFor every 10 kg ABOVE 80 kg, increase initial rate by 100ml/hr.\nIf hemorrhagic\nshock\nis also present, resuscitation for hemorrhagic shock takes precedence over resuscitation for burn shock. Administer IV/IO fluids per the TCCC Guidelines in Section 5.\nAnalgesia in accordance with\nTCCC guidelines\nin Section 11 may be administered to treat burn pain.\nPrehospital\nantibiotic\ntherapy is not indicated solely for burns, but antibiotics should be given per TCCC guidelines in Section 13 if  indicated to prevent infection in penetrating wounds.\nAll\nTCCC\ninterventions can be performed on or through burned skin in a burn casualty.\nBurn patients are particularly susceptible to hypothermia. Extra emphasis should be placed on barrier heat loss prevention methods and IV fluid warming in this phase.",
