    "Background": {
      "text": "Pediatric ankle injuries are common (>2 million ED visits in North America per year)\n[1]\nHistorically, there has been concern about missing a potential growth plate fracture (\nSalter-Harris\nType 1), which can rarely result in growth arrest\n[1]\nIt was previously taught that the weaker physis would fail before the stronger ligamentous complex.\n[2]\nThis was commonly treated with immobilization (casting), follow-up imaging, and orthopedic referral (as opposed to adult\nankle sprain\n)\nRecent studies have questioned the need for this practice\n[3]\n[4]\nThere was no measurable difference in functional recovery for children with or without\nSalter Harris\nType 1 distal fibula fractures at 1 and 3 months\n[4]",
