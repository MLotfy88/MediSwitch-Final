    "indications": "Relative Contraindications\n\nAnthracycline hypersensitivity\nPatients with previous anaphylactic reactions following administration of anthracyclines\nHepatic disease\nPatients with severe hepatic disease, defined as Child-Pugh class C or serum bilirubin greater than 5 mg/dL. Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic disease.\nPre-existing cardiac conditions\nHeart failure, cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, myocarditis, pericarditis\nAssessment of cardiac function using a MUGA or echocardiogram is necessary before starting treatment in these patients.\nGender\nFemales have a higher risk of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity\nAge\nChildren and adolescents have a higher risk of developing late cardiovascular dysfunction. They should receive periodic cardiac evaluations.\nReports of prepubertal growth inhibition/failure and gonadal impairment in children and adolescents\nPregnancy (category D)\nIn animal studies\nBreastfeeding\nLive vaccines",
    "mechanism": "The explanations of the cytostatic and cytotoxic actions of anthracyclines point to several mechanisms, including free radical formation, lipid peroxidation, direct membrane effects, and enzyme interactions. The following elucidates some of these theories:\n\nEnzyme Interaction\n\nThe most widely accepted explanation for the action of anthracyclines is their interaction with topoisomerase-II. The ternary complex thus formed prevents the re-ligation of the ds-DNA breaks. Subsequently, it promotes growth arrest and apoptotic cell death.\n[6]\n\nDNA Intercalation\n\nAnthracyclines have a chromophore moiety that intercalates between adjacent base pairs of DNA when localized to the cell's nucleus; this inhibits DNA and RNA synthesis, especially in highly replicating cells, thereby blocking cell division.\n[6]\n\nReactive Oxygen Species (ROS)\n\nRedox reactions generate reactive oxygen species in the presence of cytochrome P450 reductase, NADH dehydrogenase, and xanthine oxidase. The excess ROS cannot be detoxified, resulting in oxidative stress, DNA damage, and lipid peroxidatio,n triggering cell apoptosis.\n[6]\n\nDNA Adduct Formation\n\nThese drugs are known to form adducts with DNA promoted by formaldehyde-releasing pro-drugs. The adducts block specific transcription factors and eventually initiate apoptosis.\n[6]",
    "administration": "Anthracycline administration is generally by injection or via an intravenous infusion. The type of cancer and its stage influences the dose and duration of chemotherapy. For example, treatment may be daily for 2 weeks, followed by an off week to allow the body to recover and regenerate new cells. This 3-week cycle may then be repeated. There are numerous time and administration sequences used; this is only an example. Clinicians need to explain the administration process to the patient so they can understand the schedule, and also receive counsel on factors that may alter the administration regimen.\n\nMode of Administration\n\nInjectable\nIntravenous\nIntra-arterial - Not FDA approved for chemotherapy; used for hepatic artery chemoembolization.\nIntravesical - Used in early bladder cancer\n\nDosage\n\nAnthracycline dosing is based on body surface area and varies by indication and anthracycline type. General dose ranges for anthracyclines are listed below; specific indications vary the dose. Clinicians should consult facility-specific dosing regimens and consult package inserts for specific agents.\n\nThe following shows the dosing regimens for doxorubicin, as an example of how agents in this class may be dosed and administered.\n\nIntravenous Route\n\nAcute Lymphoblastic Leukemia\n\n60 to 75 mg/m repeated every 21 days as a single agent\n40 to 75 mg/m repeated every 21 days if combined with other chemotherapeutic agents\nCumulative dose not to exceed 550 mg/m\nThe dosing is the same for adults, adolescents, and children\n\nAcute Myelogenous Leukemia\n\n60 to 75 mg/m repeated every 21 days as a single agent\n40 to 75 mg/m repeated every 21 days if combined with other chemotherapeutic agents\nCumulative dose not to exceed 550 mg/m\nThe dosing is the same for adults, adolescents, and children\n\nHodgkin Lymphoma\n\nStanford V regimen\n25 mg/m\n2\non weeks 1,3,5,7,9, and 11 in combination with mechlorethamine, vinblastine, vincristine, bleomycin, and prednisone. The total duration of treatment is 12 weeks\nBEACOPP regimen\nAdults and adolescents 15 years or older: 25 mg/m on day 1 in combination with bleomycin, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone\nABVD/MOPP regimen\n25 mg/m\n2\non days 1 and 15 repeated every 28 days in combination with vinblastine, bleomycin, and dacarbazine\nIt is also used with vinblastine, brentuximab vedotin, and dacarbazine.\nThe dosing is the same for adults, adolescents, and children\n\nIntravesical\n\nRapidly recurrent (stage Ta or T1) or in situ transitional cell bladder cancer\n50 to 150 mg in 150 ml of normal saline is instilled into the bladder and retained for at least 30 minutes",
    "adverse_effects": "Although anthracyclines are among the most widely used chemotherapeutic agents, their therapeutic potential is limited by their extensive adverse event profile, ranging from mild to severe. The incidence rates of these reactions, however, are largely unknown.\n[7]\n[8]\n\nMild\n\nChills - Rapid\nUrticaria - Rapid\nPruritus - Rapid\nInjection site reaction - Rapid\nRash - Early\nInfection - Early\nNausea and vomiting - Early\nFever - Early\nDiarrhea - Early\nAbdominal pain - Early\nUrine discoloration - Early\nLacrimation - Early\nMalaise - Early\nAnorexia - Delayed\nPhotosensitivity - Delayed\nNail discoloration - Delayed\nSkin hyperpigmentation - Delayed\nAmenorrhea - Delayed\nOligospermia - Delayed\nAzoospermia - Delayed\nGonadal suppression - Delayed\nSpermatogenesis inhibition - Delayed\nAsthenia - Delayed\nCo-enzyme Q10 deficiency - Delayed\n\nModerate\n\nBleeding - Early\nBone marrow suppression - Delayed\nNeutropenia - Delayed\nDehydration - Delayed\nStomatitis - Delayed\nEsophagitis - Delayed\nColitis - Delayed\nErythema - Delayed\nPalmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia - Delayed\nConjunctivitis - Delayed\nPhlebitis - Delayed\nSkin ulcer - Delayed\nRadiation recall reaction - Delayed\nSkin ulcer - Delayed\nElevated hepatic enzymes - Delayed\nPeripheral neuropathy - Delayed\n\nSevere\n\nAnaphylactoid reactions - Rapid\nTissue necrosis - Early\nComa - Early\nLeukopenia - Delayed\nThrombocytopenia - Delayed\nHeart Failure - Delayed\nCardiomyopathy - Delayed\nCardiotoxicity - Delayed\nPericarditis - Delayed\nMyocarditis - Delayed\nTyphlitis - Delayed\nPeptic ulcer - Delayed\nGI bleeding - Delayed\nKeratitis - Delayed\nTumor lysis syndrome - Delayed\nNew primary malignancy - Delayed\nSeizures - Delayed\n\nResearchers are studying ways to mitigate the toxicity of anthracyclines through newer technologies, including nanoparticle delivery systems.\n[5]\n[9]\n[10]\nThe effectiveness of cardioprotective agents remains ambiguous; there is no high-quality evidence supporting their effectiveness.\n[10]",
    "monitoring": "Maximum Dosage\n\nAdults, Adolescents, and Children\n\nDoxorubicin - Maximum lifetime cumulative dose of 550 mg/m; 450 mg/m\n2\nin patients who have received previous mediastinal radiation\nDaunorubicin - 45 mg/m/dose intravenously (up to 90 mg/m/dose has been used off-label); Maximum lifetime cumulative dose of 550 mg/m\n2\n; 450 mg/m\n2\nin patients who have received previous mediastinal radiation.\nEpirubicin - 150 mg/m/dose as a single agent - maximum cumulative dose is 900mg/m\n2\n.\nValrubicin - 800 mg intravesically in adults - efficacy and safety not established in adolescents and children\nIdarubicin - 12 mg/m\n2\nintravenously; maximum cumulative lifetime dose is 150 mg/m\n2\n- efficacy and safety not established in adolescents and children\nMitoxantrone - Maximum cumulative lifetime dosage is 140 mg/m\n2\n\nChildren with BSA less than 0.5 m should have the dose calculated based on body weight.\n\nDose adjustments are necessary in patients with hepatic impairment.\n\nDrug Interactions\n\nAnthracyclines are major substrates of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Caution is necessary when using them concurrently with CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors, as this can reduce anthracycline clearance and increase the risk of cardiotoxicity and other adverse effects. Notable interactions exist with taxanes (except docetaxel) and trastuzumab.\n[11]\n[12]",
    "toxicity": "Anthracycline-Induced Cardiotoxicity\n\nCardiotoxicity induced by anthracyclines is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The clinical definition is new-onset heart failure and/or detection of left ventricular dysfunction in exposed individuals; LV ejection fraction is the most commonly used measure.\n[13]\nPatients at high risk are those receiving any of the following treatments: high dose anthracyclines (eg, doxorubicin greater than 250 mg/m), high dose radiation therapy (greater than 30 Gy) where the heart is in the radiation field, and lower dose anthracyclines in combination with lower-dose radiation therapy.\nOther risk factors - Age older than 60 years at cancer diagnosis, compromised cardiac function, multiple cardiovascular risk factors, including smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity.\n[13]\n\nAntidotes for Anthracyclines\n\nTissue necrosis induced by extravasated anthracycline can lead to many complications. Dexrazoxane is an available antidote to tackle the effects of extravasation and may also help prevent the development of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.\n[14]\n[15]"
