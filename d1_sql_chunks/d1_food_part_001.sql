Severity: Moderate

Effect: Alcohol may cause hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes.  Hypoglycemia most frequently occurs during acute consumption of alcohol.  Even modest amounts can lower blood sugar significantly, especially when the alcohol is ingested on an empty stomach or following exercise.  The mechanism involves inhibition of both gluconeogenesis as well as the counter-regulatory response to hypoglycemia.  Episodes of hypoglycemia may last for 8 to 12 hours after ethanol ingestion.  By contrast, chronic alcohol abuse can cause impaired glucose tolerance and hyperglycemia.  Moderate alcohol consumption generally does not affect blood glucose levels in patients with well controlled diabetes.  A disulfiram-like reaction (e.g., flushing, headache, and nausea) to alcohol has been reported frequently with the use of chlorpropamide and very rarely with other sulfonylureas.

Management: Patients with diabetes should avoid consuming alcohol if their blood glucose is not well controlled, or if they have hypertriglyceridemia, neuropathy, or pancreatitis.  Patients with well controlled diabetes should limit their alcohol intake to one drink daily for women and two drinks daily for men (1 drink = 5 oz wine, 12 oz beer, or 1.5 oz distilled spirits) in conjunction with their normal meal plan.

Effect: Alcohol may cause hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes.  Hypoglycemia most frequently occurs during acute consumption of alcohol.  Even modest amounts can lower blood sugar significantly, especially when the alcohol is ingested on an empty stomach or following exercise.  The mechanism involves inhibition of both gluconeogenesis as well as the counter-regulatory response to hypoglycemia.  Episodes of hypoglycemia may last for 8 to 12 hours after ethanol ingestion.  By contrast, chronic alcohol abuse can cause impaired glucose tolerance and hyperglycemia.  Moderate alcohol consumption generally does not affect blood glucose levels in patients with well controlled diabetes.  A disulfiram-like reaction (e.g., flushing, headache, and nausea) to alcohol has been reported frequently with the use of chlorpropamide and very rarely with other sulfonylureas.

Management: Patients with diabetes should avoid consuming alcohol if their blood glucose is not well controlled, or if they have hypertriglyceridemia, neuropathy, or pancreatitis.  Patients with well controlled diabetes should limit their alcohol intake to one drink daily for women and two drinks daily for men (1 drink = 5 oz wine, 12 oz beer, or 1.5 oz distilled spirits) in conjunction with their normal meal plan.

Effect: Grapefruit and grapefruit juice may significantly increase the plasma concentrations of dasatinib.  The proposed mechanism is inhibition of CYP450 3A4-mediated first-pass metabolism in the gut wall induced by certain compounds present in grapefruit.  Because grapefruit juice inhibits primarily intestinal rather than hepatic CYP450 3A4, the magnitude of interaction is greatest for those drugs that undergo significant presystemic metabolism by CYP450 3A4 (i.e., drugs with low oral bioavailability).  In general, the effect of grapefruit juice is concentration-, dose- and preparation-dependent, and can vary widely among brands.  Certain preparations of grapefruit juice (e.g., high dose, double strength) have sometimes demonstrated potent inhibition of CYP450 3A4, while other preparations (e.g., low dose, single strength) have typically demonstrated moderate inhibition.

Management: Patients treated with dasatinib should avoid consumption of grapefruit, grapefruit juice, and any supplement containing grapefruit extract.  Some authorities recommend close monitoring for toxicity (e.g., myelosuppression, bleeding complications, fluid retention, bradycardia or other conduction disturbances) and a reduction of dasatinib dosage to a range of 20 to 40 mg daily should be considered if there are no alternatives and concomitant use with a potent CYP450 3A4 inhibitor is necessary.', 'DDInter', 0, NULL);

Effect: Alcohol may cause hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes.  Hypoglycemia most frequently occurs during acute consumption of alcohol.  Even modest amounts can lower blood sugar significantly, especially when the alcohol is ingested on an empty stomach or following exercise.  The mechanism involves inhibition of both gluconeogenesis as well as the counter-regulatory response to hypoglycemia.  Episodes of hypoglycemia may last for 8 to 12 hours after ethanol ingestion.  By contrast, chronic alcohol abuse can cause impaired glucose tolerance and hyperglycemia.  Moderate alcohol consumption generally does not affect blood glucose levels in patients with well controlled diabetes.  A disulfiram-like reaction (e.g., flushing, headache, and nausea) to alcohol has been reported frequently with the use of chlorpropamide and very rarely with other sulfonylureas.

Management: Patients with diabetes should avoid consuming alcohol if their blood glucose is not well controlled, or if they have hypertriglyceridemia, neuropathy, or pancreatitis.  Patients with well controlled diabetes should limit their alcohol intake to one drink daily for women and two drinks daily for men (1 drink = 5 oz wine, 12 oz beer, or 1.5 oz distilled spirits) in conjunction with their normal meal plan.

Management: Patients should receive dietary counseling and be advised to not use potassium-containing salt substitutes or over-the-counter potassium supplements without consulting their physician.  If salt substitutes are used concurrently, regular monitoring of serum potassium levels is recommended.  Patients should also be advised to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms of hyperkalemia such as weakness, irregular heartbeat, confusion, tingling of the extremities, or feelings of heaviness in the legs.', 'DDInter', 0, NULL);

Effect: Concomitant use of some food may reduce the bioavailability of orally administered iron, and vice versa.

Management: Ideally, iron products should be taken on an empty stomach (i.e., at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals), but if this is not possible, administer with meals and monitor the patient more closely for a subtherapeutic effect.  Some studies suggest administration of iron with ascorbic acid may enhance bioavailability.  In addition, administration of oral iron products and some oral medications should be separated whenever the bioavailability of either agent may be decreased.  Consult the product labeling for specific separation times and monitor clinical responses as appropriate.', 'DDInter', 0, NULL);
INSERT OR IGNORE INTO food_interactions (id, med_id, interaction, source, created_at, trade_name) VALUES (790, 0, 'Interaction Type: Tyrosine-rich foods
Severity: Major

Effect: Foods that contain large amounts of tyramine may precipitate a hypertensive crisis in patients treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).  The mechanism is inhibition of MAO-A, the enzyme responsible for metabolizing exogenous amines such as tyramine in the gut and preventing them from being absorbed intact.  Once absorbed, tyramine is metabolized to octopamine, a substance that is believed to displace norepinephrine from storage granules.

Management: In general, patients treated with MAOIs or other agents that possess MAOI activity (e.g., furazolidone, linezolid, procarbazine) should avoid consumption of products that contain large amounts of amines and protein foods in which aging or breakdown of protein is used to increase flavor.  These foods include cheese (particularly strong, aged or processed cheeses), sour cream, wine (particularly red wine), champagne, beer, pickled herring, anchovies, caviar, shrimp paste, liver (particularly chicken liver), dry sausage, salamis, figs, raisins, bananas, avocados, chocolate, soy sauce, bean curd, sauerkraut, yogurt, papaya products, meat tenderizers, fava bean pods, protein extracts, yeast extracts, and dietary supplements.  Caffeine may also precipitate hypertensive crisis so its intake should be minimized as well.  At least 14 days should elapse following discontinuation of MAOI therapy before these foods may be consumed.  Specially designed reference materials and dietary consultation are recommended so that an appropriate and safe diet can be planned.  Patients should be advised to promptly seek medical attention if they experience potential signs and symptoms of a hypertensive crisis such as severe headache, visual disturbances, difficulty thinking, stupor or coma, seizures, chest pain, unexplained nausea or vomiting, and stroke-like symptoms.  Patients should also be counseled not to use MAOIs with alcohol, and to avoid hazardous activities requiring complete mental alertness and motor coordination until they know how these agents affect them.', 'DDInter', 0, NULL);
