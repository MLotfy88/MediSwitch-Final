Reported cases have primarily occurred in the setting of buprenorphine maintenance treatment for opiate addiction, and many, but not all, involved abuse or misuse of buprenorphine including intravenous self-injection.  The mechanism of interaction probably involves some degree of additive pharmacologic effects.  Preclinical studies also suggest that benzodiazepines can alter the usual ceiling effect on buprenorphine-induced respiratory depression and render the respiratory effects of buprenorphine appear similar to those of full opioid agonists.  Coadministration of buprenorphine with some CNS depressants such as alcohol, benzodiazepines, and phenothiazines may also increase the risk of hypotension.','alcohol','Major','The use of opioids in conjunction with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants should generally be avoided unless alternative treatment options are inadequate.  If coadministration is necessary, the dosage and duration of each drug should be limited to the minimum required to achieve desired clinical effect.  Patients should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation, and advised to avoid driving or operating hazardous machinery until they know how these medications affect them.  Extreme caution is advised when prescribing buprenorphine to patients who are addicted to opioids and also abusing benzodiazepines or alcohol.  Due to potential risk of overdose and death, dependence on sedative-hypnotics such as benzodiazepines or alcohol is considered a relative contraindication for office-based buprenorphine treatment of opioid addiction.  For patients who have been receiving extended therapy with both an opioid and a benzodiazepine and require discontinuation of either medication, a gradual tapering of dose is advised, since abrupt withdrawal may lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Severe cases of benzodiazepine withdrawal, primarily in patients who have received excessive doses over a prolonged period, may result in numbness and tingling of extremities, hypersensitivity to light and noise, hallucinations, and epileptic seizures.','','','DDInter',0),(3741,0,'Butorphanol','Ethanol may potentiate the central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects of opioid analgesics.
