If coadministration is required, assessment of baseline QT interval and periodic monitoring during therapy may be considered. The manufacturer recommends a dosage reduction for valbenazine during concomitant administration with strong CYP450 2D6 inhibitors or in patients who are poor metabolizers of CYP450 2D6. Patients and their caregivers should be advised to seek prompt medical attention if they experience symptoms that could indicate the occurrence of torsade de pointes such as dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, palpitation, irregular heart rhythm, shortness of breath, or syncope. Ambulatory patients should be counseled to avoid hazardous activities requiring mental alertness and motor coordination until they know how these agents affect them, and to notify their doctor if they experience excessive or prolonged CNS effects that interfere with their normal activities.",

      "management_text": "The use of vandetanib in combination with other medications that can prolong the QT interval should generally be avoided. Should treatment with other QT-prolonging drugs be required, the manufacturer recommends more frequent monitoring of the ECG as well as serum potassium, magnesium, and calcium levels. Given vandetanib's half-life of 19 days, ECGs and serum electrolytes should typically be obtained at baseline, at 2 to 4 weeks and 8 to 12 weeks after starting treatment, and every 3 months thereafter. Vandetanib should not be started if baseline QTcF is greater than 450 ms, and treatment should be interrupted if QTcF is greater than 500 ms. Treatment may resume when QTcF returns to less than 450 ms, but at a reduced dosage. In addition, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and/or hypocalcemia must be corrected prior to vandetanib administration. Since diarrhea is a common side effect of vandetanib and may cause electrolyte imbalances, ECG and electrolyte levels should also be monitored more frequently when diarrhea develops. Vandetanib treatment should be stopped in the presence of severe diarrhea. Treatment may resume when diarrhea improves, but at a reduced dosage. Following any dosage reduction, or any interruption of treatment greater than 2 weeks, QT assessment and serum electrolytes should be conducted as described previously. Patients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms that could indicate the occurrence of torsade de pointes such as dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, palpitations, irregular heartbeat, shortness of breath, or syncope. Because of the drug's long half-life, adverse reactions including a prolonged QT interval may not resolve quickly, thus appropriate monitoring is necessary.",

When relugolix was coadministered with erythromycin, a combined P-gp and moderate CYP450 3A inhibitor, relugolix peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and systemic exposure (AUC) increased by 6.2-fold. Increased exposure to relugolix may increase the risk and/or severity of adverse effects such as hot flushes; weight gain; decreased sex drive; erectile function difficulties; QT interval prolongation; musculoskeletal pain; constipation; diarrhea; increases in glucose, triglyceride, and liver transaminase levels; and decreased hemoglobin. Long-term androgen deprivation therapy, including relugolix, can prolong the QT interval.

If coadministration is required, the manufacturer recommends taking relugolix first and separating the dosing by at least 6 hours. Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected prior to initiating therapy, and periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and electrolytes should be considered.

Use of neuroleptics in combination with other neuroleptics or anticholinergic agents may increase the risk of tardive dyskinesia.  In addition, some neuroleptics and tricyclic antidepressants may cause prolongation of the QT interval and theoretically, concurrent use of two or more drugs that can cause QT interval prolongation may result in additive effects and increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias including torsade de pointes and sudden death.",

Certain systemic reactions stemming from parenteral iron therapy are thought to be mediated by inflammatory substances such as bradykinin in response to iron-catalyzed generation of toxic free radicals. Since ACE inhibitors decrease the breakdown of kinins, it is conceivable that they may potentiate these reactions. Anaphylactic-type reactions, including fatalities, have followed the parenteral administration of iron dextran. Such reactions occur most often within the first several minutes of administration and are generally characterized by sudden onset of respiratory difficulty and/or cardiovascular collapse. The extent of risk for anaphylactic-type reactions following exposure to any specific iron dextran product is unknown, but may vary among the products due to differences in chemical characteristics.",
      "management_text": "Patients should be closely monitored during and after parenteral administration of iron dextran, regardless of whether they are being treated with an ACE inhibitor. This is particularly important in patients with a history of drug allergy or multiple drug allergies or an immune/inflammatory condition such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis. Resuscitation techniques and personnel trained in the detection and treatment of anaphylactic-type reactions should be readily available. Prior to the first therapeutic dose, a test dose corresponding to 25 mg iron should be injected gradually. Although anaphylactic reactions are usually evident within a few minutes, observe patients for at least one hour before administering the remainder of the therapeutic dose. Administration must be stopped immediately if signs of an anaphylactoid reaction are observed. Patients should also be closely monitored during each subsequent administration of iron dextran. Fatal reactions have occurred following the test dose and also in situations where the test dose was tolerated. According to some studies, non-dextran parenteral iron formulations may be associated with a lower risk of adverse effects, especially death and life-threatening reactions such as anaphylaxis, cardiac arrest, and respiratory depression.",

In patients who have recently been vaccinated, high-dose corticosteroid therapy should not be initiated for at least 2 weeks. Household contacts of immunosuppressed patients should also not be vaccinated. However, there are no absolute contraindications to vaccination if a high-risk exposure has occurred. In an outbreak emergency, smallpox vaccine is generally recommended for all persons, regardless of medical conditions. The risk for experiencing serious complications from the vaccine should be weighed against the risk of acquiring a potentially fatal smallpox infection.
