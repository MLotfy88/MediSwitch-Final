    "indications": "The spleen is the largest lymphoid organ in the body, playing a crucial role in the immune system and fostering the production and maturation of essential components such as immunoglobulin M, B lymphocytes, and opsonins within its confines. One critical function of the spleen is to protect the body against infections from polysaccharide-encapsulated bacteria, such as\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\nand other Streptococcal species (eg,\nHaemophilus influenzae\ntype b,\nNeisseria meningitidis\n,\nEscherichia coli\n,\nSalmonella\n,\nKlebsiella)\n.\n\nAdditionally, the spleen acts as the primary reservoir for platelets and serves as a filter for red blood cells, eliminating damaged or malformed cells from circulation. Further, the spleen facilitates extramedullary hematopoiesis, a process crucial for blood cell production.\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\nFunctional asplenism, also known as \"functional hyposplenism\" or \"splenic hypofunction,\" is a medical condition where the spleen is structurally intact but does not function properly. The term \"functional asplenia\" was coined by Pearson et al in 1969 while studying patients with sickle cell anemia.\n[4]",
    "mechanism": "Functional asplenism is characterized by the absence of phagocytic activity while maintaining the presence of splenic tissue, and occurs as a result of:\n\nAutoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Hashimoto thyroiditis, antiphospholipid syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, or autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1, also known as autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy\n[5]\n[6]\nInflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, hepatic cirrhosis, sickle cell disease, beta thalassemia, chronic graft-versus-host disease, and nephrotic syndrome\n[7]\n[8]\nAdvanced human immunodeficiency virus infection\n[9]\nHematologic-oncogenic disorders like acute leukemias, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and advanced breast cancer\nTherapies including bone marrow transplantation, high-dose corticosteroids, splenic irradiation, and total parenteral nutrition\nOther disorders like amyloidosis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and primary pulmonary hypertension\n[10]",
    "monitoring": "A functional hyposplenism diagnosis may be based on hematology, nuclear medicine, ultrasound imaging, or immunological parameters. The peripheral blood smear is vital for evaluating functional asplenism, as various cells may help identify functional asplenism. Howell-Jolly bodies on a peripheral blood smear indicate abnormal spleen function.\n[19]\nHowell-Jolly bodies are nuclear remnants of old red blood cells (RBCs) typically removed by the spleen (see\nImage.\nHowell-Jolly Body). Although they are typically found on a peripheral blood smear, a flow cytometry-based assay for Howell-Jolly bodies is currently under investigation. Thrombocytosis, lymphocytosis, and monocytosis are additional hematological signs of functional asplenism. Acanthocytes, giant cells, Heinz bodies, and iron granules may also be observed on a peripheral blood smear. Demonstration of many of these abnormalities requires special dyes and microscopy. In addition, the presence and quantitation of \"pitted\" RBCs have been used to determine the function of remaining splenic tissue.\n[11]\n\nA technetium-99m-labeled radiocolloid scan helps evaluate splenic function by measuring the uptake of injected radio-labeled particles by the splenic endothelium relative to the liver.\n[2]\nThis scan provides information regarding the phagocytic function of the spleen. Liver-spleen scintigraphy has the disadvantage of being invasive and time-consuming for patients. Newer methods currently in use include immune response upon vaccination or evaluating the functionality of specific B-cell subsets. Functional asplenia is also associated with small, avascular spleens on Doppler sonography.\n[20]\nImmunological methods such as measuring tuftsin levels are of little clinical significance for evaluating spleen phagocytic function.\n[21]",
    "administration": "Treating and managing functional asplenism reduces the risk of infections and complications associated with this condition. Some of the recommended strategies include:\n\nVaccinations: Vaccination is an essential aspect of managing functional asplenism. Patients should receive vaccinations against the bacteria that commonly cause infections in people with impaired spleen function, including vaccines against\nS pneumoniae\n,\nH influenzae\ntype b, and\nN meningitidis\n. Patients should also receive annual influenza vaccination to reduce the risk of influenza-related complications. Study results have shown a significant reduction in the percentage of severe infections in patients after immunization with pneumococcal vaccines. The commonly used pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine is ineffective in those who are asplenic because it requires the presence of immunoglobulin M memory B cells. The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is more effective in functionally asplenic patients because it employs a T-cell-dependent mechanism and is the preferred vaccine. In addition, vaccines are thought to act better when the spleen is intact. Hence, the vaccine should be given 2 weeks before surgery in patients undergoing splenectomy. Moreover, patients with impaired splenic function should receive 3 doses of messenger ribonucleic acid COVID-19 vaccines, just like other patients who are immunocompromised. This is supported by the notion that a subset of memory B cells in the spleen could exert a protective role against this virus.\n[22]\nAntibiotics: Patients with functional asplenia may be prescribed long-term antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infections. Antibiotics such as penicillin or amoxicillin are typically used for this purpose, but local microorganism resistance should be considered. In addition, antimalarial prophylaxis should be given to patients traveling to malaria-endemic areas.\n[17]\nAntibiotic prophylaxis: This is generally reserved for patients who are asplenic or hyposplenic who undergo procedures like endoscopic sinus surgery or bronchoscopy, as encapsulated organisms (such as\nS pneumoniae\nand\nH influenzae\ntype b) can colonize these areas, leading to a fatal infection. For adults, 2 grams of amoxicillin is given orally 30 to 60 minutes before the procedure. For children, 3 months of age and older, and weighing less than 40 kg, amoxicillin 50 mg/kg is given an hour before the procedure (maximum dose 2 g). Alternatives include cephalosporins (eg, cephalexin), clindamycin, and macrolides such as azithromycin or erythromycin. Levofloxacin and moxifloxacin can also be used for adults.\nTreatment for animal bites in patients who are asplenic should involve thorough wound irrigation and antibiotic therapy that targets Capnocytophaga species. In the event of an animal bite, the first line of treatment consists of a beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combination antibiotic, such as piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g every 6 hours) or meropenem (2 g every 8 hours) in combination with vancomycin to target Capnocytophaga species. However, meropenem is usually preferred over piperacillin-tazobactam when meningitis is suspected due to its higher penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid.\nEducation and awareness: Patients with functional asplenism should be educated on the signs and symptoms of infection and when to seek medical attention. Patients should also be encouraged to carry a medical alert card or bracelet that identifies their condition and advises on appropriate management in an emergency.\nRegular medical follow-up: Patients with functional asplenism should receive regular medical follow-up to monitor for complications and adjust management as necessary.\n\nManaging functional asplenia is individualized and may vary depending on the underlying condition causing it. Therefore, consulting a healthcare professional with experience managing functional asplenia is essential.",
    "adverse_effects": "Overwhelming Post-Splenectomy Infection\n\nOverwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI) is a syndrome encountered in patients who have functional asplenia. Bacteremia caused by encapsulated microorganisms characterizes the syndrome, with the most commonly reported pathogen in OPSI being\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\n. The syndrome might present without a visible primary source of infection and with a short prodromal phase; clinical presentations include septic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and bilateral adrenal hemorrhage. OPSI is a medical emergency, and antibiotics should be administered immediately, along with supportive measures.\n[26]\n\nPatients who are hyposplenic might already be taking prophylactic antibiotics, and hence, cultures might be negative; however, antibiotic therapy should continue. Empiric parental antibiotic therapy should include vancomycin and either cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. Although the efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin treatment for asplenic sepsis has not been proven, some experts recommend its administration in this situation. The mortality of OPSI is high, with overall mortality rates of 50% to 70%, and death may result in 24 to 48 hours.\n\nThis syndrome has been observed from 10 years and up to 30 years after diagnosis with hyposplenism. Some studies indicate that the risk of OPSI decreases with the time elapsed since splenectomy, while other studies do not show a significant reduction.\n\nThrombocytosis\n\nFunctional asplenism is almost always associated with secondary elevation of platelet count because the spleen is the leading site of platelets’ destruction and provokes reflexive thrombocytosis. However, this is not seen in patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension; these patients present with thrombocytopenia rather than thrombocytosis due to impaired liver function. Thrombocytosis increases the risk of thrombotic events.\n\nVenous thrombosis in patients with asplenism is associated with platelet counts greater than 600 to 800 k/µL and occurs in approximately 5% of patients. Thrombocytosis can also cause arterial thrombosis, leading to myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accidents. Some patients take aspirin or even a cytoreductive agent such as hydroxyurea or anagrelide to reduce the risk of thrombotic events.\n\nAcute infectious purpura fulminans\n\nAcute infectious purpura fulminans is a rapidly progressive syndrome of hemorrhagic skin necrosis associated with acute infection due to encapsulated organisms (usually\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\nor group A streptococci) resulting in disseminated intravascular coagulation with a strong predilection for patients with asplenism or functional hyposplenism.\n[27]"
