      "text": "Selecting appropriate dressings for wound care can improve lives and save limbs. The choice of appropriate dressings can significantly affect the rate of healing, the strength of the repaired skin, and the cosmetic appearance of the scar. In general, moisture content of the wound is paramount and dressings are selected that are best suited to maintain a balance: moist enough to promote healing while removing excess exudate\n[1]\nOccluded wounds heal 40% faster than open wounds.\n[2]",

    "Wound_Packing": {
      "text": "Although wet-to-wet and wet-to-moist packing has been the standard of care for many years, research indicates that gauze dressings are labor intensive and therefore not optimal. Many superior options are now available.\n[4]\nWet-to-Wet Dressings\nIndication: To keep a clean wound clean and prevent the build-up of exudates. \nTechnique: Moisten a piece of gauze with saline and just barely squeeze out the excess fluid so it isn't soaking wet. Unravel the gauze, place it onto the wound, and cover with a dry dressing over the top. The dressing should not be allowed to dry or stick to the wound. Change 2-3 times per day. Moisten with saline if it gets too dry.\nWet-to-Moist Dressings\nIndication: To clean a dirty or infected wound. \nTechnique: Moisten a piece of gauze with saline and squeeze out the excess fluid so it is damp, not dripping wet. Unravel the gauze, place it onto the wound, and cover with a dry dressing over the top. The dressing is allowed to dry out and when it is removed it pulls off the debris. Ideally, change 3-4 times per day. Change more often on a wound that is in need of more debridement, less often on a cleaner wound. Switch to the wet-to-wet dressing when the wound is clean.  \nNote: The wet-to-moist dressing is not a substitute for mechanical/sharp debridement.",
