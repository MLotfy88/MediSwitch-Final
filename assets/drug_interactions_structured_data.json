Mycophenolate mofetil may reduce effectiveness of oral contraceptives. Use of additional barrier contraceptive methods is recommended [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ]. For patients who are considering pregnancy, discuss appropriate alternative immunosuppressants with less potential for embryofetal toxicity.

Females of reproductive potential must use an acceptable form of birth control during the entire mycophenolate mofetil therapy and for 6 weeks after stopping mycophenolate mofetil, unless the patient chooses abstinence . Mycophenolate mofetil may reduce effectiveness of oral contraceptives. Use of additional barrier contraceptive methods is recommended [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ]. For patients who are considering pregnancy, discuss appropriate alternative immunosuppressants with less potential for embryofetal toxicity. Risks and benefits of mycophenolate mofetil should be discussed with the patient. Advise sexually active male patients and/or their partners to use effective contraception during the treatment of the male patient and for at least 90 days after cessation of treatment. This recommendation is based on findings of animal studies [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ].",
