    "indications": "Immunocompromised patients\n\nBCG is a live vaccine and should not be given to:\n\nImmunocompromised persons with congenital immunodeficiency, HIV infection, malignancy, or those taking immunosuppressive drugs such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha blockers and corticosteroids\nAdults with HIV infection living in areas of low TB prevalence",
    "clinical_significance": "BCG vaccination after infancy has a substantial effect on tuberculin skin test (TST) reactivity.  BCG trial in the United States showed that individuals who received BCG after infancy had tuberculin skin test reactions ≥10 mm up to 55 years post-immunization.\n[29]\n\nPrior BCG vaccination should not affect the interpretation of TST results in individuals vaccinated at birth more than ten years earlier given that most individuals who receive the BCG vaccine come from areas where there is a high incidence of TB.  Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) should be used to interpret positive TSTs in persons with a history of BCG immunization since this test is not affected by BCG administration.  In individuals exposed to serial tuberculin testing, previous BCG vaccination may be increased, leading to a positive skin test in an individual with a prior negative skin test. Greater than 50 percent of patients that received intravesical BCG for bladder cancer have been reported to result in conversion to a positive tuberculin skin test. This exposure to intravesical BCG should not result in a positive IGRA result.\n[30]\n[31]\n\nThe rationale for the development of a booster vaccine is due to decreasing immunity about 15-20 years after the initial immunization at infancy\n[32]\n. However, studies done in Brazil and Malawi have shown that a booster dose of the BCG vaccine is not very effective against TB disease\n[33]\n[34]\n[35]\n. BCG vaccine may offer protection against infections due to nontuberculous mycobacteria.\n[36]\n\nStudies have shown that the BCG vaccine decreases the risk of disease due to\nMycobacterium leprae\nby 50 to 80 percent and this effect is increased with booster doses of BCG.\n[34]\n[37]\nPrior studies had shown that the vaccine is also 50 percent effective in preventing Buruli ulcer disease due to\nM. ulcerans,\nbut a more recent retrospective study failed to show evidence that BCG protected against Buruli ulcer disease.\n[38]\n\nBCG vaccination also protects against childhood lymphadenitis due to\nM. avium\ncomplex\n[39]\nhas been an increase in childhood adenitis due to non-tuberculous mycobacteria since the cessation of childhood BCG immunization.\n[40]\n[41]\n\nTuberculin skin test (TST) reaction of 3 to 19 mm in size is expected in most individuals that received BCG immunization two to three months after vaccination.  In a study of 5952 individuals who had BCG vaccination and subsequently underwent tuberculin skin testing 10 to 25 years later, only 8 percent had positive skin test results.\n[31]"
