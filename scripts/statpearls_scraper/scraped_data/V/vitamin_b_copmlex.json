    "clinical_significance": "Though generally uncommon, bariatric surgery complications can have significant clinical implications, underscoring the need for comprehensive, multidisciplinary care. Complications like anastomotic leaks, bleeding, internal hernias, malnutrition, and gastrointestinal issues can result in severe, sometimes life-threatening consequences. These complications often require prompt diagnosis, tailored treatment plans, and ongoing management, making it critical for patients to receive care from diverse healthcare professionals, each offering expertise in different areas.\n\nThe clinical significance of these complications is multifaceted. For example, anastomotic leaks or internal hernias can lead to peritonitis, sepsis, and organ failure if not managed quickly and effectively. Nutritional deficiencies, such as vitamin B12, iron, and calcium deficiencies, can result in long-term health problems, including anemia, osteopenia, and neurological complications. Psychological complications, including depression and anxiety, may arise or worsen as patients adjust to dramatic changes in their bodies and lifestyles, further complicating the recovery process. Given the broad spectrum of potential issues—ranging from metabolic and nutritional concerns to psychological and surgical complications—bariatric surgery requires input from a wide array of specialists.\n\nMultidisciplinary care is essential for optimizing patient outcomes and addressing the challenges that arise postoperatively. A team of surgeons, dietitians, psychologists, endocrinologists, and physical therapists ensures that all aspects of a patient's health are monitored and managed. This comprehensive, team-based approach significantly improves bariatric surgery patients' long-term success and health by addressing the physical and psychological aspects of recovery and lifestyle change.",
    "monitoring": "Nutritional parameters should be monitored regularly after bariatric surgery, including B vitamins, iron and trace elements. General labwork should be followed annually, including liver function tests, complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and lipid panel.\n[40]"
