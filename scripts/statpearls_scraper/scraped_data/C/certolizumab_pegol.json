    "indications": "Enteropathic arthritis refers to immune-driven rheumatologic conditions linked to gastrointestinal pathology, typically denoting the inflammatory spondyloarthropathies associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and reactive arthritis triggered by bacterial and parasitic infections. Psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy are other inflammatory spondyloarthropathies.\n\nJoint involvement is a common extraintestinal manifestation of IBD, which may precede the onset of intestinal manifestations. Spondyloarthritis manifests with axial involvement of the spine and sacroiliac joints, peripheral involvement, or a combination of both.\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\nPatients with other gastrointestinal illnesses such as celiac disease, Whipple disease, and collagenous colitis may also experience arthritis.\n[1]\n\nAxial joint involvement in enteropathic arthropathy varies from subclinical inflammation observed on imaging to severe symptoms with functional limitations, which may progress independently of the underlying IBD activity.\n[1]\n[4]\nPeripheral joint disease exhibits an oligoarticular or polyarticular pattern, with symptoms more often correlating with bowel inflammation. The symptoms and findings associated with peripheral spondyloarthritis are predominantly or entirely peripheral rather than axial. Arthritis, which is asymmetric or predominantly of the lower limbs, enthesitis, and dactylitis are all common features of peripheral spondyloarthritis.\n\nThe Oxford criteria classifies enteropathic spondyloarthritis into 3 types.\n[5]\nType 1 describes oligoarticular disease correlating with bowel inflammation, type 2 describes chronic symmetric polyarticular disease independent of IBD activity, and type 3 presents as axial and sometimes peripheral involvement whose progression does not correlate with IBD activity. Healthcare professionals seldom utilize this classification and designate all subtypes as peripheral spondyloarthritis.\n\nThe emergence of biological therapies has significantly improved outcomes for both IBD and associated arthropathies. The interconnection between arthritis and bowel inflammation is continually unfolding, with emerging evidence of dysbiosis and decreased microbiota diversity impacting disease onset and progression. Healthcare professionals can further classify axial disease using the Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society classification criteria.\n[6]\nAssessing joint disease is crucial for selecting treatments that cover all aspects of the condition. When choosing therapies, clinicians should also consider related manifestations such as uveitis, psoriasis, and pyoderma gangrenosum. This method guarantees comprehensive coverage, effectively addressing all relevant disease domains.\n[7]\n[8]",
    "mechanism": "Axial involvement is associated with the human leukocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27), a class I molecule, and follows a course independent of IBD activity.\n[1]\nReactive arthritis and spondylitis are also strongly associated with the presence of HLA-B27. Polymorphisms in the genes for tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-23 (IL-23), also shared with IBD and psoriasis, and endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase-1 (ERAP-1) and endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase-2 (ERAP-2) are also associated with enteropathic arthritis. ERAP-1 is key in antigen processing and presentation to HLA class I molecules.\n[9]\nType 1 peripheral arthritis is associated with HLA-DRB1*0103, HLA-B27, and HLA-B35. In contrast, HLA-B44 predominates in association with type 2 peripheral arthritis.\n[4]\n\nIL-23 receptor polymorphisms and caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9 (CARD9) mutations are also associated with inflammatory bowel disease and enteropathic arthritis. CARD9 mutations can activate inflammasomes in response to bacterial and fungal proteins.\n[10]\nIL-23 plays a significant role in activating macrophages. The T helper 17 (Th17) pathway activates innate lymphoid cells, including intestinal luminal cells. These intestinal luminal cells can produce interleukin-17 (IL-17) and interleukin-22 (IL-22). IL-22 protects mucosal cells; however, IL-17 and IL-22 can trigger tissue inflammation. See\nTable 1. Genes Associated with Chron Disease and Ankylosing Spondlytis\nfor a comprehensive list of genes associated with these conditions.\n\nTable\nTable 1. Genes Associated with Crohn Disease and Ankylosing Spondylitis.",
    "monitoring": "Healthcare professionals should consider the possibility of enteropathic arthritis when a patient with IBD experiences joint pain and swelling or inflammatory back pain. Clinicians should examine the joints for evidence of inflammation, noting the pattern and symmetry. In addition, they should examine the digits and periarticular soft tissues for edema and tenderness, focusing on the Achilles tendon insertion. The clinical assessment should include an examination of the spine and sacroiliac joints, flexibility, range of motion, and tenderness of the sacroiliac joints.\n\nAdditional maneuvers are the modified Schober test and occiput-wall distance. To perform the modified Schober test, the patient stands, and the clinician marks both posterior superior iliac spines and then draws a horizontal line at the center of both marks. The clinician then marks a second line 5 cm below the first line and a third line 10 cm above the first line. Then, the patient bends forward, and the clinician measures the distance between the top and bottom lines. Patients who show a <5 cm increase in length with forward flexion have a decreased lumbar spine range of motion.\n\nThe occiput-wall distance is used to assess the severity of the axial disease. To perform this assessment, the patient stands with their back against the wall and posture as straight as possible, ensuring the heels, calf, buttocks, and shoulders touch the wall. Then, they attempt to have their occiput touch the wall, ensuring that the orbit's lower margin and the acoustic meatus's upper margin are aligned horizontally. The occiput touches the wall in most normal patients, and the measurement is 0. If the occiput does not touch the wall, the distance is measured. A distance >2 cm is considered abnormal.\n\nA focused abdominal examination is crucial for identifying tenderness, and a perianal examination is essential for detecting the perirectal disease. Clinicians should assess the skin for pyoderma gangrenosum, most often noted with ulcerative colitis, and erythema nodosum, frequently associated with Crohn disease. An ophthalmologic examination is necessary to evaluate for evidence of uveitis or conjunctivitis.\n\nDiagnostic Studies\n\nLaboratory studies:\nLaboratory tests are nonspecific. Indicated labs are a complete blood count, rheumatoid factor (RF), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and anti-endomysial and anti-transglutaminase antibodies. A complete blood count may reveal various abnormalities, including anemia, thrombocytosis, and leukocytosis. Both the CRP and ESR are likely to be elevated. The RF should be negative. CRP levels are higher in patients with enteropathic arthritis with axial involvement.\n[39]\nIn patients with one or only a few involved joints, arthrocentesis and synovial fluid analysis should be performed to exclude septic arthritis. Septic arthritis can present in an atypical manner in patients with IBD who are receiving immunosuppressant medications. Synovial fluid should reveal mild to moderate inflammatory fluids with predominately mononuclear cells. The cultures should be negative, and no crystals should be present.\n\nFecal calprotectin elevations occur in inflammatory colorectal disease, but this test lacks the necessary sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing IBD in patients with enteropathic arthritis. Endoscopy with biopsy is the preferred diagnostic modality for patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of IBD.\n[17]\n\nImaging studies:\nWhen the clinical signs of inflammatory arthritis are present, there is no need for imaging studies of joints to establish the diagnosis. However, they are crucial in evaluating joint damage and disease progression.\n\nThe preferred initial imaging modality for patients presenting with inflammatory back pain is plain radiographs of the spine and sacroiliac joints.\n[40]\n[41]\nLumbar spine and sacroiliac joint radiography can reveal signs of enthesitis at the annulus fibrosis, appearing as squaring of vertebral bodies, erosions and sclerosis of superior and inferior margins, and formation of marginal ossification of the annulus fibrosis called syndesmophytes. Sacroiliac joint radiographs may reveal erosions, sclerosis, and ankylosis with symmetric involvement.\n\nMusculoskeletal ultrasound can assist in evaluating peripheral joint involvement. Pertinent findings are joint effusions, and color-power Doppler signals consistent with active inflammation. Ultrasound is also a sensitive method to detect tendinopathy, bursal involvement, and inflammatory abnormalities at the entheses during the early phase of the disease. A study reveals that 87.8% of patients with IBD exhibit signs of enthesitis when assessed using ultrasound.\n[42]\n\nSacroiliac and lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with short tau inversion recovery is considered the gold standard for assessing axial spondyloarthritis and sacroiliitis. This method identifies active inflammation when plain radiography appears normal. MRI findings of active sacroiliitis include osteitis, bone marrow edema, and enthesitis. Bone marrow edema located in the subchondral bone adjacent to the articular surface of the sacroiliac joint is the most crucial criterion for the diagnosis of active sacroiliitis.\n\nSigns of structural damage from prior inflammation, such as subchondral sclerosis, subchondral or periarticular erosions, periarticular fat deposition, or ankylosis, can also be helpful in disease monitoring. MRI may reveal evidence of sacroiliitis in 15% to 20% of patients with IBD but no axial symptoms.\n[43]\n[44]\nThe 2015 European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology guidelines recommend sacroiliac MRI imaging if a clinician is unable to establish the diagnosis of spondyloarthritis based on clinical history and conventional radiography.\n[40]\nMagnetic resonance enterography, a diagnostic imaging technique used to assess bowel inflammation, may detect inflammatory lesions at the sacroiliac joints in asymptomatic patients who are asymptomatic.\n[45]\n\nComputed tomography (CT) scans of the abdomen and pelvis are often used to assess the activity of bowel disease in patients with IBD.\n[46]\nVisualizing the sacroiliac joints and spine allows for noting sacroiliitis and spondylitis. While MRI is useful for showing inflammation related to active disease, CT scanning is highly sensitive to bone changes, including erosions, syndesmophytes, and fusion.\n\nAdditional testing:\nEnteropathic arthritis and other inflammatory diseases substantially impact functional status and quality of life. Depression is a frequent comorbidity of enteropathic arthritis; screening using tools such as the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) and PHQ-9 is helpful.\n\nClinicians can extrapolate arthritic disease activity from existing disease activity scores for axial spondyloarthritis, including the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index and the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score.\n[47]\n[48]\nBowel assessment measurements to assess severity include the Crohn's Disease Activity Index.\n[49]",
    "administration": "Separate guidelines exist for treating IBD, axial spondyloarthritis, and peripheral spondyloarthritis. The therapeutic strategy must be individualized to encompass the combination of IBD and spondyloarthritis clinical manifestations, while also considering skin and eye manifestations. The main objective is to enhance the long-term quality of life and prevent damage by managing inflammation in all affected organ systems.\n\nThe use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\n(NSAIDs) as first-line agents for both axial and peripheral enteropathic arthritis is controversial. Research investigating the connection between NSAIDs and the recurrence or exacerbation of IBD yields contradictory findings. Evidence supports the safety of brief NSAID courses, particularly during periods of inactive IBD. Several studies suggest that COX-2 inhibitors are safe for short-term usage, typically up to 3 months.\n[50]\n[51]\nGiven the limitations in evidence, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 2019 spondyloarthritis management guidelines do not recommend selective COX-2 inhibitors over other NSAIDs in patients with IBD.\n[52]\n\nManagement of Peripheral Arthritis\n\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs:\nPatients with peripheral disease begin treatment with NSAIDs and local glucocorticoid injections or low-dose oral glucocorticoids. Experts recommended the use of nonselective NSAIDs such as naproxen at doses of 375 to 500 mg twice daily or the COX-2-selective NSAID celecoxib at a dose of 100 mg twice daily. A proton pump inhibitor should accompany the administration of nonselective NSAIDs.\n\nDisease-modifying antirheumatic drugs:\nIf NSAIDs and local glucocorticoid injections prove insufficient, clinicians may add conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs such as methotrexate and sulfasalazine. If one NSAID proves ineffective, conduct a second NSAID trial unless the first NSAID exacerbated IBD symptoms. Sulfasalazine is the preferred choice, with an initial dose of 500 mg twice daily, followed by an increase in the daily dose to 1000 mg every 2 weeks until arthritis symptoms improve or until the patient reaches a maximum dose of 1000 mg 3 times daily. Patients should undergo a trial of at least 12 weeks before determining efficacy. The dosing for methotrexate is 10 mg once weekly, with gradual dose increments of 2.5 to 5 mg weekly until the patient achieves control of their joint inflammation or reaches a dose of 25 mg per week. No robust data support the use of azathioprine, an immunosuppressant used to treat IBD, for enteropathic arthritis.\n\nTumor necrosis factor inhibitors:\nClinicians should aim to achieve concurrent control of underlying IBD symptoms as well. Patients with new-onset enteropathic arthritis and quiescent IBD should undergo evaluation by their gastroenterologist for possible asymptomatic gastrointestinal inflammation. For those who continue to have inadequate control of their symptoms, clinicians should try TNF inhibitors. TNF inhibitors\neffectively treat enteropathic-related peripheral and axial arthritis, dactylitis, enthesitis, and uveitis.\n[53]\nThe monoclonal antibody TNF inhibitors, including infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol, are all effective for joint and bowel disease.\n[54]\n[55]\n\nEtanercept, a receptor fusion protein, should be avoided in enteropathic arthritis as it provides beneficial results on joints but not on bowel disease.\n[56]\n[57]\n[58]\n[59]\nEtanercept is associated with worsening inflammatory bowel disease.\n[60]\nTNF inhibitors are also a good choice for patients with axial disease unresponsive to NSAIDs or severe or resistant gastrointestinal disease activity. Before initiating TNF inhibitor therapy, healthcare professionals must screen patients for latent tuberculosis and perform baseline chest radiography to assess the risk of reactivating latent tuberculosis. Patients with evidence of latent, previously untreated tuberculosis should begin antituberculous therapy before beginning TNF inhibitor therapy. Clinicians should assess the efficacy of the TNF inhibitor after 3 months, and if it is found to be ineffective, a second TNF inhibitor should be attempted.\n\nInterleukin inhibitors:\nFailure of a TNF inhibitor to control symptoms prompts a therapeutic trial of ustekinumab, which inhibits IL-12 and IL-23 and has demonstrated effectiveness in treating Crohn's disease and psoriatic arthritis. While its efficacy for IBD-related peripheral arthritis is unclear, evidence suggests that it may be effective for axial symptoms. Although IL-17 inhibitors such as secukinumab and ixekizumab are commonly used to treat spondyloarthritis, they are not used in enteropathic arthritis because IL-17 inhibition is ineffective in treating and may induce flares of IBD.\n[61]\n[62]\n\nJanus kinase inhibitors:\nJanus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, including tofacitinib and upadacitinib, have a role in managing both peripheral and axial symptoms related to enteropathic arthritis.\n[63]\n[64]\nThis drug class also effectively controls aspects of IBD at higher doses. However, in 2021, the United States Food and Drug Administration issued a black box warning regarding the increased risk of heart disease, thromboembolism, cancer, and death with JAK inhibitors, potentially limiting their use.\n\nIntegrin inhibitors:\nMonoclonal antibodies against integrin α4β7 specifically target gastrointestinal tract disease. A post-hoc analysis of the GEMINI trial demonstrates a significant reduction of arthralgia and arthritis in patients with IBD treated with vedolizumab compared to placebo.\n[65]\n[66]\nPotential adverse effects associated with vedolizumab are new and worsening arthralgia, de novo severe spondyloarthritis, and enthesopathy.\n[67]\nHealthcare professionals do not commonly use vedolizumab monotherapy in the treatment of enteropathic arthritis. Combination therapy with TNF inhibitors is a potential option for patients with TNF inhibitor-responsive spondyloarthritis who have poorly controlled IBD. Several case reports and series have reported successful combination therapy of TNF and integrin inhibitors without increasing adverse events.\n[68]\n[69]\n\nSystemic glucocorticoids:\nSystemic glucocorticoids can be appropriate for acute flares of peripheral joint involvement and IBD. Glucocorticoids should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible due to adverse events. Recommended dosing regimens include methylprednisolone 80 to 120 mg administered through an intramuscular injection or a short course of oral glucocorticoids such as prednisone, initially starting at 20 mg per day and then tapered over 2 weeks. Intraarticular joint injections, including sacroiliac injections, are also utilized for more limited joint involvement.\n\nManagement of Axial Arthritis\n\nNSAIDs and an exercise program are first-line agents for axial arthritis. Back strengthening and stretching are imperative for long-term management, and patients with axial involvement should seek assistance from a physical therapist for assessment and proper instruction. Failure of NSAIDs to treat the patient adequately prompts the addition of a TNF inhibitor. There is no evidence to support the use of sulfasalazine or methotrexate. Conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs are ineffective in controlling axial inflammation. The treatment approach for patients who have not received adequate results with 2 TNF inhibitors follows the same algorithm as that for peripheral arthritis.",
    "adverse_effects": "Enteropathic arthritis significantly impacts health-related quality of life, and inflammatory bowel diseases can lead to multiple intestinal, articular, and extra-articular complications.\n\nGastrointestinal Complications\n\nGastrointestinal complications include Obstruction, strictures, fistulas, abscesses, primary sclerosing cholangitis, colorectal cancer, small bowel malignancies, osteoporosis, and fragility fractures.\n[78]\nPatients with ileal Crohn disease are at the highest risk of developing intestinal strictures and fistulas. In contrast, ulcerative colitis is commonly associated with colorectal cancer and primary sclerosing cholangitis.\n\nArticular Complications\n\nArticular complications include chronic pain and disability, loss of lumbar lordosis and spinal mobility, spinal deformities, vertebral fractures and subluxation, and spinal cord injury due to vertebral fractures.\n\nExtra-Articular Complications\n\nExtra-articular complications include uveitis, aortic insufficiency, cardiac conduction abnormalities, and pyoderma gangrenosum.\n[78]\nUveitis, aortic insufficiency, and cardiac conduction abnormalities are most common in patients who are HLA-B27 positive, with axial involvement and increased disease duration. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease associated with peripheral polyarticular joint involvement show an increased prevalence of autoimmune thyroiditis.\n[2]\nSeveral studies reveal an increased arterial and venous thrombosis and cardiovascular risk in patients with IBD and spondyloarthritis. However, data regarding thrombotic and cardiovascular risk in enteropathic arthritis are lacking.\n[79]\n[80]"
