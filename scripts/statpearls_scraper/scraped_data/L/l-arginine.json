    "clinical_significance": "Fall in Urine Output\n\nEvaluation of UO bears significant clinical relevance. Decreased UO is one of the criteria defining AKI and can be one of the earliest signs of the condition.\n[4]\nOliguria—defined as less than 0.5 mL/kg/h—has also been associated with an increased mortality rate.\n[5]\n[6]\n[5]\nThus, prompt detection of a decrease in UO can lead to early intervention and prevent disease progression. However, clinical history, physical examination, and other laboratory biomarkers such as urea and electrolytes are required alongside UO assessment to narrow the differential diagnosis and direct medical treatment.\n\nRise in Urine Output\n\nAn elevated UO is also clinically significant and can indicate other disease processes. Increased UO is often caused by excess IV fluid administration, often unwittingly, if multiple providers are involved in patient care. Arginine vasopressin is an endocrine hormone produced by the posterior part of the pituitary gland and acts on the kidney's tubules to increase water absorption. Most physiological causes of increased UO revolve around suppressed production or resistance to arginine vasopressin. An increased UO may indicate conditions such as central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus or primary polydipsia.\n[7]\n\nMeasurement of UO is therefore highly beneficial in clinical settings, as a fall or rise in UO may indicate specific disease processes and, thus, influence medical management."
