      "text": "Patients with Endovascular Aortic Repair (EVAR) can have unique complications that are not discussed in most emergency medicine literature.\nEVAR has largely replaced open aortic repair as the gold standard for the treatment of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA).\nCommon complications including aortoenteric fistula, endoleaks, and graft thrombosis can present in a similar fashion to other common ED diagnoses.",
