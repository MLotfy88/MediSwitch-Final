Ibuprofen has been specifically implicated, and there is evidence that others including indomethacin, naproxen, and tiaprofenic acid may also interact. The mechanism is competitive inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase by certain NSAIDs, which, unlike aspirin, bind reversibly at the active site of the enzyme and cause a temporary rather than persistent depression of thromboxane formation and thromboxane-dependent platelet function. The combined use of aspirin with NSAIDs in general may increase the potential for serious gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity, including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation.",
      "management_text": "Patients receiving low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection should avoid the regular use of ibuprofen and possibly other NSAIDs. Occasional use of ibuprofen is acceptable, as the risk from any attenuation of the antiplatelet effect of low-dose aspirin is likely to be minimal given the long-lasting effect of aspirin on platelets. In patients receiving immediate-release (not enteric-coated) aspirin, single doses of ibuprofen 400 mg may be used but should not be administered within 8 hours before or 30 minutes after the aspirin dose. There are currently no specific recommendations regarding the dosing and timing of single-dose ibuprofen in patients receiving enteric-coated low-dose aspirin. For patients requiring routine NSAID therapy with concomitant low-dose aspirin, diclofenac may be a viable alternative. In the retrospective study implicating ibuprofen, 75 mg twice daily of delayed-release diclofenac did not interfere with the antiplatelet activity of aspirin. Other noninterfering alternatives for pain include acetaminophen, celecoxib, or narcotic analgesics. In any case, caution is advised whenever aspirin is combined with a NSAID due to the potential for additive GI toxicity. Patients should be advised to take the medications with food and to immediately report signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding such as abdominal pain, bloating, sudden dizziness or lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, anorexia, and melena.",

Theoretical concerns exist regarding the potential for increased risk and severity of renal impairment during coadministration of bisphosphonates with high dosages or chronic use of NSAIDs due to additive or synergistic nephrotoxic effects on the kidney. The use of bisphosphonates has been associated with nephrotoxicity manifested as deterioration of renal function and renal failure. Cases have primarily involved intravenous formulations of the drugs such as pamidronic acid and zoledronic acid, especially when they are administered too rapidly. The risk of hypocalcemia may also be increased, as drug-induced renal tubular damage can lead to renal loss of calcium and other electrolytes such as magnesium. Bisphosphonates alone often cause mild, asymptomatic hypocalcemia via inhibitive effects on bone resorption and possibly chelation of blood calcium. Chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be associated with renal toxicities including elevations in serum creatinine and BUN, tubular necrosis, glomerulitis, renal papillary necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and renal failure.",

Theoretical concerns exist regarding the potential for increased risk and severity of renal impairment during coadministration of bisphosphonates with high dosages or chronic use of NSAIDs due to additive or synergistic nephrotoxic effects on the kidney. The use of bisphosphonates has been associated with nephrotoxicity manifested as deterioration of renal function and renal failure. Cases have primarily involved intravenous formulations of the drugs such as pamidronic acid and zoledronic acid, especially when they are administered too rapidly. The risk of hypocalcemia may also be increased, as drug-induced renal tubular damage can lead to renal loss of calcium and other electrolytes such as magnesium. Bisphosphonates alone often cause mild, asymptomatic hypocalcemia via inhibitive effects on bone resorption and possibly chelation of blood calcium.

The combined use of aspirin with NSAIDs in general may increase the potential for serious gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity, including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation.
