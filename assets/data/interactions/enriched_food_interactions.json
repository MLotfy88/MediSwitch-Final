Asparaginase-associated hepatotoxicity has been reported more commonly in adults than in children and has been strongly associated with obesity.  Hepatomegaly, acute severe hepatotoxicity, and fatal liver failure have been reported with asparaginase treatment in adults.  Also, asparaginase may increase the toxicity of drugs bound to plasma proteins or metabolized by the liver.\n\nManagement: The risk of additive hepatotoxicity should be considered when asparaginase is used with other hepatotoxic agents (e.g., alcohol, androgens, antituberculosis agents, azole antifungal agents, ACE inhibitors, macrolide antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, sulfonamides, thiazolidinediones, and statins).  Liver function tests should be monitored at regular intervals during asparaginase treatment with or without other hepatotoxic drugs.  Patients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience potential symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as right upper quadrant pain, increasing abdominal size, fever, rash, itching, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, malaise, dark urine, pale stools, and jaundice.",

Pharmacokinetic interactions involving grapefruit juice are also subject to a high degree of interpatient variability, thus the extent to which a given patient may be affected is difficult to predict.\n\nManagement: Patients who regularly consume grapefruit or grapefruit juice should be monitored for adverse effects and altered plasma concentrations of drugs that undergo significant presystemic metabolism by CYP450 3A4.  Grapefruit and grapefruit juice should be avoided if an interaction is suspected.  Orange juice is not expected to interact with these drugs.",

Although grapefruit juice is an inhibitor of CYP450 3A4 and quinine is metabolized by this pathway to its major metabolite, 3-hydroxyquinine, a study of ten healthy volunteers found no significant differences in quinine peak plasma concentration (Cmax), time to reach Cmax (Tmax), terminal elimination half-life, systemic exposure (AUC), or apparent oral clearance (Cl/F) when a single 600 mg oral dose of quinine sulfate was administered in combination with 200 mL of orange juice (control), half-strength grapefruit juice, and full-strength grapefruit juice twice daily for 6 days each, separated by a 2-week washout period.  Relative to the control period, the apparent renal clearance of quinine was markedly increased by 81% during treatment with half-strength grapefruit juice.  However, since renal clearance accounts for approximately 6% of the total clearance of quinine, this change would likely have minimal clinical impact.  The lack of a significant interaction is probably due to the fact that grapefruit juice primarily inhibits intestinal rather than hepatic CYP450 3A4, and quinine is not known to undergo significant presystemic metabolism as evidenced by its relatively high oral bioavailability (76% to 88%).  Nevertheless, excessive consumption of grapefruit juice and tonic water (which contains quinine) was suspected as the cause of torsade de pointes arrhythmia in a patient with a history of asymptomatic long QT syndrome.  Treatment with magnesium sulfate and metoprolol had no effect, but the arrhythmia resolved spontaneously 48 hours after discontinuation of the drinks.\n\nManagement: Based on current data, moderate grapefruit juice consumption is probably safe for the majority of patients taking quinine.",

However, certain foods like some of the aged cheeses (e.g., Boursault, Liederkrantz, Mycella, Stilton) may contain very high amounts of tyramine and could potentially cause a hypertensive reaction in patients taking rasagiline even at recommended dosages due to increased sensitivity to tyramine.  Patients should be advised to avoid ingesting very high levels of tyramine (e.g., greater than 150 mg), and to promptly seek medical attention if they experience potential signs and symptoms of a hypertensive crisis such as severe headache, visual disturbances, confusion, stupor or coma, seizures, chest pain, unexplained nausea or vomiting, and stroke-like symptoms.  Rasagiline should not be used at dosages exceeding 1 mg/day (0.5 mg/day for patients with mild hepatic impairment or concomitant use of ciprofloxacin or other CYP450 1A2 inhibitors), as it can increase the risk of hypertensive crisis and other adverse reactions associated with nonselective inhibition of MAO.

Similar decreases in Cmax and AUC were reported when the tablet was administered with a moderate-fat meal.  In contrast, the extent of absorption of ritonavir from the soft gelatin capsule formulation was 13% higher when administered with a meal (615 KCal; 14.5% fat, 9% protein, and 76% carbohydrate) relative to fasting.\n\nManagement: Ritonavir should be taken with meals to enhance gastrointestinal tolerability.",

Elevated liver transaminases, hepatitis, jaundice/cholestasis, hepatic failure, and acute hepatic necrosis have been reported with the use of leflunomide.  Liver enzyme elevations were generally mild (2 times the upper limit of normal or less) and resolved while continuing treatment.  Marked elevations (greater than 3-fold ULN) occurred infrequently and reversed with dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment in most cases.\n\nManagement: Caution is advised if leflunomide or teriflunomide must be used in patients who are currently receiving or have recently received treatment with other hepatotoxic agents (e.g., acetaminophen; alcohol; androgens and anabolic steroids; antituberculous agents; azole antifungal agents; ACE inhibitors; cyclosporine (high dosages); disulfiram; endothelin receptor antagonists; interferons; ketolide and macrolide antibiotics; kinase inhibitors; minocycline; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents; nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors; proteasome inhibitors; retinoids; thiazolidinediones; tolvaptan; vincristine; zileuton; anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine, hydantoins, felbamate, and valproic acid; lipid-lowering medications such as fenofibrate, lomitapide, mipomersen, niacin, and statins; herbals and nutritional supplements such as black cohosh, chaparral, comfrey, DHEA, kava, pennyroyal oil, and red yeast rice), and vice versa.

    "interaction": "Alcohol may cause hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes.  Hypoglycemia most frequently occurs during acute consumption of alcohol.  Even modest amounts can lower blood sugar significantly, especially when the alcohol is ingested on an empty stomach or following exercise.  The mechanism involves inhibition of both gluconeogenesis as well as the counter-regulatory response to hypoglycemia.  Episodes of hypoglycemia may last for 8 to 12 hours after ethanol ingestion.  By contrast, chronic alcohol abuse can cause impaired glucose tolerance and hyperglycemia.  Moderate alcohol consumption generally does not affect blood glucose levels in patients with well controlled diabetes.  A disulfiram-like reaction (e.g., flushing, headache, and nausea) to alcohol has been reported frequently with the use of chlorpropamide and very rarely with other sulfonylureas.\n\nManagement: Patients with diabetes should avoid consuming alcohol if their blood glucose is not well controlled, or if they have hypertriglyceridemia, neuropathy, or pancreatitis.  Patients with well controlled diabetes should limit their alcohol intake to one drink daily for women and two drinks daily for men (1 drink = 5 oz wine, 12 oz beer, or 1.5 oz distilled spirits) in conjunction with their normal meal plan.

Once absorbed, tyramine is metabolized to octopamine, a substance that is believed to displace norepinephrine from storage granules.\n\nManagement: In general, patients treated with MAOIs or other agents that possess MAOI activity (e.g., furazolidone, linezolid, procarbazine) should avoid consumption of products that contain large amounts of amines and protein foods in which aging or breakdown of protein is used to increase flavor.  These foods include cheese (particularly strong, aged or processed cheeses), sour cream, wine (particularly red wine), champagne, beer, pickled herring, anchovies, caviar, shrimp paste, liver (particularly chicken liver), dry sausage, salamis, figs, raisins, bananas, avocados, chocolate, soy sauce, bean curd, sauerkraut, yogurt, papaya products, meat tenderizers, fava bean pods, protein extracts, yeast extracts, and dietary supplements.  Caffeine may also precipitate hypertensive crisis so its intake should be minimized as well.  At least 14 days should elapse following discontinuation of MAOI therapy before these foods may be consumed.

Vitamin K is a cofactor in the synthesis of blood clotting factors that are inhibited by oral anticoagulants, thus intake of vitamin K through supplements or diet can reverse the action of oral anticoagulants.  Resistance to oral anticoagulants has been associated with consumption of foods or enteral feedings high in vitamin K content.  Likewise, a reduction of vitamin K intake following stabilization of anticoagulant therapy may result in elevation of the INR and bleeding complications.  Foods rich in vitamin K include beef liver, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, collard greens, endive, kale, lettuce, mustard greens, parsley, soy beans, spinach, Swiss chard, turnip greens, watercress, and other green leafy vegetables.  Moderate to high levels of vitamin K are also found in other foods such as asparagus, avocados, dill pickles, green peas, green tea, canola oil, margarine, mayonnaise, olive oil, and soybean oil.  Snack foods containing the fat substitute, olestra, are fortified with 80 mcg of vitamin K per each one ounce serving so as to offset any depletion of vitamin K that may occur due to olestra interference with its absorption.  Whether these foods can alter the effect of oral anticoagulants has not been extensively studied.  One small study found that moderate consumption (1.5 servings/day) does not significantly affect the INR after one week in patients receiving long-term anticoagulation.\n\nManagement: Intake of vitamin K through supplements or diet should not vary significantly during oral anticoagulant therapy.  The diet in general should remain consistent, as other foods containing little or no vitamin K such as mangos and soy milk have been reported to interact with warfarin.  Some experts recommend that continuous enteral nutrition should be interrupted for one hour before and one hour after administration of the anticoagulant dose and that enteral formulas containing soy protein should be avoided.

Reported cases have primarily occurred in the setting of buprenorphine maintenance treatment for opiate addiction, and many, but not all, involved abuse or misuse of buprenorphine including intravenous self-injection.  The mechanism of interaction probably involves some degree of additive pharmacologic effects.  Preclinical studies also suggest that benzodiazepines can alter the usual ceiling effect on buprenorphine-induced respiratory depression and render the respiratory effects of buprenorphine appear similar to those of full opioid agonists.  Coadministration of buprenorphine with some CNS depressants such as alcohol, benzodiazepines, and phenothiazines may also increase the risk of hypotension.\n\nManagement: The use of opioids in conjunction with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants should generally be avoided unless alternative treatment options are inadequate.  If coadministration is necessary, the dosage and duration of each drug should be limited to the minimum required to achieve desired clinical effect.  Patients should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation, and advised to avoid driving or operating hazardous machinery until they know how these medications affect them.  Extreme caution is advised when prescribing buprenorphine to patients who are addicted to opioids and also abusing benzodiazepines or alcohol.  Due to potential risk of overdose and death, dependence on sedative-hypnotics such as benzodiazepines or alcohol is considered a relative contraindication for office-based buprenorphine treatment of opioid addiction.  For patients who have been receiving extended therapy with both an opioid and a benzodiazepine and require discontinuation of either medication, a gradual tapering of dose is advised, since abrupt withdrawal may lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Severe cases of benzodiazepine withdrawal, primarily in patients who have received excessive doses over a prolonged period, may result in numbness and tingling of extremities, hypersensitivity to light and noise, hallucinations, and epileptic seizures.",

Dosing at bedtime may improve the tolerability of nervous system symptoms such as dizziness, insomnia, impaired concentration, somnolence, abnormal dreams and hallucinations, although they often resolve on their own after the first 2 to 4 weeks of therapy .  Patients should be advised of the potential for additive central nervous system effects when efavirenz is used concomitantly with alcohol or psychoactive drugs, and to avoid driving or operating hazardous machinery until they know how the medication affects them.",

    "interaction": "Alcohol may cause hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes.  Hypoglycemia most frequently occurs during acute consumption of alcohol.  Even modest amounts can lower blood sugar significantly, especially when the alcohol is ingested on an empty stomach or following exercise.  The mechanism involves inhibition of both gluconeogenesis as well as the counter-regulatory response to hypoglycemia.  Episodes of hypoglycemia may last for 8 to 12 hours after ethanol ingestion.  By contrast, chronic alcohol abuse can cause impaired glucose tolerance and hyperglycemia.  Moderate alcohol consumption generally does not affect blood glucose levels in patients with well controlled diabetes.  A disulfiram-like reaction (e.g., flushing, headache, and nausea) to alcohol has been reported frequently with the use of chlorpropamide and very rarely with other sulfonylureas.\n\nManagement: Patients with diabetes should avoid consuming alcohol if their blood glucose is not well controlled, or if they have hypertriglyceridemia, neuropathy, or pancreatitis.  Patients with well controlled diabetes should limit their alcohol intake to one drink daily for women and two drinks daily for men (1 drink = 5 oz wine, 12 oz beer, or 1.5 oz distilled spirits) in conjunction with their normal meal plan.

The mechanism is inhibition of MAO-A, the enzyme responsible for metabolizing exogenous amines such as tyramine in the gut and preventing them from being absorbed intact.  Once absorbed, tyramine is metabolized to octopamine, a substance that is believed to displace norepinephrine from storage granules.\n\nManagement: In general, patients treated with MAOIs or other agents that possess MAOI activity (e.g., furazolidone, linezolid, procarbazine) should avoid consumption of products that contain large amounts of amines and protein foods in which aging or breakdown of protein is used to increase flavor.  These foods include cheese (particularly strong, aged or processed cheeses), sour cream, wine (particularly red wine), champagne, beer, pickled herring, anchovies, caviar, shrimp paste, liver (particularly chicken liver), dry sausage, salamis, figs, raisins, bananas, avocados, chocolate, soy sauce, bean curd, sauerkraut, yogurt, papaya products, meat tenderizers, fava bean pods, protein extracts, yeast extracts, and dietary supplements.  Caffeine may also precipitate hypertensive crisis so its intake should be minimized as well.  At least 14 days should elapse following discontinuation of MAOI therapy before these foods may be consumed.  Specially designed reference materials and dietary consultation are recommended so that an appropriate and safe diet can be planned.  Patients should be advised to promptly seek medical attention if they experience potential signs and symptoms of a hypertensive crisis such as severe headache, visual disturbances, difficulty thinking, stupor or coma, seizures, chest pain, unexplained nausea or vomiting, and stroke-like symptoms.
