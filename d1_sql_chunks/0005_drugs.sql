More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Rosuvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [simvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] This is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than [atorvastatin]''s effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial[A181427] concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.

Rosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]','["C10BX10", "C10BX05", "C10BX07", "C10AA07", "A10BH52", "G01AE10", "C10BX13", "C10BX09", "C10BA09", "C10BX16", "C10BX17", "C10BX14", "C10BA06"]','[]'),(3566,'Zswev joint 30 tabs','زسف جوينت 30 قرص','390','','Multivitamin','Glucosamine sulfate+chondroitin sulfate+msm+ginkgo biloba+protein nlt+copper+manganese+vitamin d3+vitamin c','Advent pharma','Tab','أقراص','','3','','','','',1354,'2025-04-17',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(3567,'Diabenor 2 mg 30 tabs.','ديابينور 2مجم 30 قرص','36','20.25','Anti-diabetic.secretagogues.sulfonylurea','Glimepiride','Egpi','Tab','أقراص','2 mg','3','','indications : this medication is a sulfonylurea antidiabetic agent prescribed for type 2 diabetes. it works by causing the pancreas to produce insulin dosage : the recommended starting dose is 1-2 mg once daily with food.maximum: 2mg/day contraindications','6223003932350','',2217,'2024-02-18',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'First introduced in 1995, glimepiride is a member of the second-generation sulfonylurea (SU) drug class used for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to improve glycemic control.

It is commonly marketed under the brand name Amaryl as oral tablets and is typically administered once daily.','["A10BD04", "A10BB12", "A10BD06"]','[]'),(3583,'Diabyl 80mg 20 tab.','ديابيل 80مجم 20 قرص','9','','Anti-diabetic.secretagogues.sulfonylurea','Gliclazide','Memphis','Tab','أقراص','80mg','2','','about gliclazide first generation sulfonylurea oral antidiabetic agent. mechanism of action of gliclazide it is an antidiabetic drug which exerts it`s action by increasing insulin release from the pancreas and by improving glucose tolerance. it acts on th','6221050030524','',896,'2023-04-11',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'A10BB09',NULL),(3584,'Diacerein 50mg 30 cap.','دياسيرين 30 كبسولة','156','115.5','Anti-inflammatory','Diacerin','Eva pharma','Cap','كبسولة','50mg','3','1- آلام الركبتين ومفصل القدم.','(indications) : this medication is an anti-inflammatory agent prescribed for osteoarthritis and chronic inflammatory arthritis. it works by inhibiting interleukin-1. dosage & when it is to be taken : osteoarthritis- adult-po- the recommended dose is 50 mg','6223002453634','',14432,'2024-08-10',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(3586,'Hemascore 30 caps','هيماسكور 30 كبسولة','89','','Iron supplement','Iron+vitamin c+vitamin b12+folic acid','B2r / private therapy','Cap','كبسولة','','3','','','6225000564138','',1195,'2025-04-23',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(3588,'Dia-furyl 220mg/5ml oral susp. 60 ml','دايا-فيوريل 60 مل معلق','9','','Antidiarrheal','Nifuroxazide','Borg','Susp','معلق','220mg','1','','indications infectious diarrhea in children and adults chronic colitis enterocolitis as an adjunctive treatment in combined therapy of intestinal dysbiosis. contraindication hypersensitivity to 5-nitrofurane derivatives and/or other components of the drug','6223002570225','',1197,'2022-12-04',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'A07AX03',NULL),(3589,'Flip fun face serum 15 ml','فليب فن سيرم للوجه 15 مل','65','59','Viscous liquid','Melaleuca alternifolia+tocopherol+thymus vulgaris+chamomilla recutita+chlorhexidine digluconate','2m whites pharma','Serum','سيروم','15 ml','1','','','6774444300104','',1390,'2025-09-24',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(3590,'Diaglu 20 capsules','دياجلو 20كبسولة','18','','','Gymnema sylvestre','Mepaco','Capsule','كبسولة','','2','','during blood sugar control','6223002211739','',1495,'2022-12-04',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(3591,'Egy zinc cream 75 gm','ايجي زنك كريم 75 جرام','100','','Skin smothing and moisturising cream','Zinc oxide + cod liver oil + panthenol + honey + glycerin','Egy minds','Cream','كريم','75 gm','1','','','','',922,'2022-09-24',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL);

Aaron B. Lerner of Yale University is credited for naming the hormone and for defining its chemical structure in 1958.  In mammals, melatonin is produced by the pineal gland. The pineal gland is small endocrine gland, about the size of a rice grain and shaped like a pine cone (hence the name), that is located in the center of the brain (rostro-dorsal to the superior colliculus) but outside the blood-brain barrier. The secretion of melatonin increases in darkness and decreases during exposure to light, thereby regulating the circadian rhythms of several biological functions, including the sleep-wake cycle. In particular, melatonin regulates the sleep-wake cycle by chemically causing drowsiness and lowering the body temperature.  Melatonin is also implicated in the regulation of mood, learning and memory, immune activity, dreaming, fertility and reproduction. Melatonin is also an effective antioxidant.  Most of the actions of melatonin are mediated through the binding and activation of melatonin receptors. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may have lower than normal levels of melatonin. A 2008 study found that unaffected parents of individuals with ASD also have lower melatonin levels, and that the deficits were associated with low activity of the ASMT gene, which encodes the last enzyme of melatonin synthesis. Reduced melatonin production has also been proposed as a likely factor in the significantly higher cancer rates in night workers.','["N05CH01"]','[]'),(3595,'Dialy-cal 500mg 30 f.c.tab.','ديالي كال 500مجم 30 قرص','10','','Calcium supplement','Calcium acetate','Pharopharma','Tab','أقراص','500mg','3','','about calcium acetate anti hyperphosphatemic. mechanism of action of calcium acetatescalcium acetate is used to treat hyperphosphatemia (high blood phosphate levels) in patients with kidney disease. by lowering blood phosphate levels calcium acetate can h','6221094085627','',966,'2023-01-12',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'The chemical compound calcium acetate is the calcium salt of acetic acid.

It is primarily used for the treatment of respiratory, enteric and genitourinary infections and may be used instead of other macrolides for some sexually transmitted and enteric infections. It is structurally related to erythromycin [A174169].

Azithromycin [9-deoxo-9a-aza-9a-methyl-9a-homoerythromycin] is a part of the _azalide_ subclass of macrolides, and contains a 15-membered ring, with a methyl-substituted nitrogen instead of a carbonyl group at the 9a position on the aglycone ring, which allows for the prevention of its metabolism. This differentiates azithromycin from other types of macrolides [A174175].

In March 2020, a small study was funded by the French government to investigate the treatment of COVID-19 with a combination of azithromycin and the anti-malaria drug [hydroxychloroquine]. The results were positive, all patients taking the combination were virologically cured within 6 days of treatment, however, larger studies are required.[A192546]','["J01RA07", "S01AA26", "J01FA10"]','[]'),(3700,'Limitless alpha l-citrulline 192 g','ليميتلس الفا ال سيترولين 192 جم','680','800','','Creatine','Eva pharma','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','6223012481542','',1188,'2025-02-08',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'An amino acid derivative that occurs in vertebrate tissues and in urine.

Recently a new indication was added to treat symptomatic heart failure from dilated cardiomyopathy for patients 6 months or more in age[Label]. Ivabradine acts by selectively inhibiting the "funny" channel pacemaker current (If) in the sinoatrial node in a dose-dependent fashion, resulting in a lower heart rate and thus more blood to flow to the myocardium. Although non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and beta blockers also effectively lower heart rate, they exhibit adverse events due to their negative ionotropic effects.

It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infections along with other antibiotics including [DB01060], [DB01211], and [DB00916], for example.[A177271, F4498] Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [DB00338], [DB00213], [DB00448], [DB05351], and [DB01129]. Esomeprazole is the s-isomer of [DB00338], which is a racemate of the S- and R-enantiomer. Esomeprazole has been shown to inhibit acid secretion to a similar extent as [DB00338], without any significant differences between the two compounds _in vitro_. 

Esomeprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of esomeprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, esomeprazole''s duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]

PPIs such as esomeprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as esomeprazole has been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients such as iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]

Rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as esomeprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion.[A177574] Esomeprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing to prevent this rebound effect.','["A02BD06", "A02BC05", "M01AE52"]','[]'),(3713,'Bloximin 30 capsules','بلوكسيمين 30 كبسولة','310','185','Vascular-protecting agent','Diosmin+hesperidin','Drug pharma egypt','Capsule','كبسولة','','3','','','','',2008,'2025-12-14',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(3714,'Diosed-c 20 tabs.','ديوسيد-سي 20 قرص','76','48','Vascular-protecting agent','Diosmin+hesperidin+vitamin c','Sedico','Tab','أقراص','','2','مقوي للشعيرات الدموية -- لعلاج نزيف اللثة -- نزيف البواسير -- آلام ما قبل الدورة الشهرية','about diosmins bioflavonoid a semisynthetic phlebotropic drug treating hemorrhoids a vascular-protecting agent. mechanism of action of diosmins these are agents used for bleeding disorders involving increased capillary fragility. it normalizes impaired ph','6221042056020','',10696,'2024-11-26',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL);

Overall, valsartan''s physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium. 

Valsartan also affects the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays an important role in hemostasis and regulation of kidney, vascular, and cardiac functions. Pharmacological blockade of RAAS via  AT1 receptor blockade inhibits negative regulatory feedback within RAAS, which is a contributing factor to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal disease. In particular, heart failure is associated with chronic activation of RAAS, leading to inappropriate fluid retention, vasoconstriction, and ultimately a further decline in left ventricular function. ARBs have been shown to have a protective effect on the heart by improving cardiac function, reducing afterload, increasing cardiac output and preventing ventricular hypertrophy and remodelling.[A174154] 

By comparison, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) class of medications (which includes drugs such as [ramipril], [lisinopril], and [perindopril]) inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II through inhibition of the ACE enzyme.

Structurally, ergocalciferol differs from cholecalciferol in that it possesses a double bond between C22 and C23 and has an additional methyl group at C24 [L5689]. Finally, ergocalciferol is pharmacologically less potent than cholecalciferol, which makes vitamin D3 the preferred agent for medical use [L5689].

Appropriate levels of vitamin D must be upheld in the body in order to maintain calcium and phosphorus levels in a healthy physiologic range to sustain a variety of metabolic functions, transcription regulation, and bone metabolism [A223, L5689, L1782, L5771, F4027, F4042, F4048].

ARBs selectively bind to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) and prevent the protein angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects, which include vasoconstriction, stimulation and synthesis of aldosterone and ADH, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, among others. Overall, valsartan''s physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium. 

Valsartan also affects the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays an important role in hemostasis and regulation of kidney, vascular, and cardiac functions. Pharmacological blockade of RAAS via  AT1 receptor blockade inhibits negative regulatory feedback within RAAS, which is a contributing factor to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal disease. In particular, heart failure is associated with chronic activation of RAAS, leading to inappropriate fluid retention, vasoconstriction, and ultimately a further decline in left ventricular function. ARBs have been shown to have a protective effect on the heart by improving cardiac function, reducing afterload, increasing cardiac output and preventing ventricular hypertrophy and remodelling.[A174154] 

By comparison, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) class of medications (which includes drugs such as [ramipril], [lisinopril], and [perindopril]) inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II through inhibition of the ACE enzyme. However, this does not prevent the formation of all angiotensin II within the body. The angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs unique in that it blocks all angiotensin II activity, regardless of where or how it was synthesized. 

Valsartan is commonly used for the management of hypertension, heart failure, and Type 2 Diabetes-associated nephropathy, particularly in patients who are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors. ARBs such as valsartan have been shown in a number of large-scale clinical outcomes trials to improve cardiovascular outcomes including reducing risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, the progression of heart failure, and hospitalization.[A174124,A178153,A173869,A185324,A185327,A185333,A185342,A185345] Valsartan also slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy due to its renoprotective effects.[A174157,A174160,A174163] Improvements in chronic kidney disease with valsartan include both clinically and statistically significant decreases in urinary albumin and protein excretion in patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and in nondiabetic patients diagnosed with chronic kidney disease.[A174124,A173869]

The pineal gland is small endocrine gland, about the size of a rice grain and shaped like a pine cone (hence the name), that is located in the center of the brain (rostro-dorsal to the superior colliculus) but outside the blood-brain barrier. The secretion of melatonin increases in darkness and decreases during exposure to light, thereby regulating the circadian rhythms of several biological functions, including the sleep-wake cycle. In particular, melatonin regulates the sleep-wake cycle by chemically causing drowsiness and lowering the body temperature.  Melatonin is also implicated in the regulation of mood, learning and memory, immune activity, dreaming, fertility and reproduction. Melatonin is also an effective antioxidant.  Most of the actions of melatonin are mediated through the binding and activation of melatonin receptors. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may have lower than normal levels of melatonin. A 2008 study found that unaffected parents of individuals with ASD also have lower melatonin levels, and that the deficits were associated with low activity of the ASMT gene, which encodes the last enzyme of melatonin synthesis.

The main effect of SUs is thought to be effective when residual pancreatic β-cells are present,[A177715] as they work by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreatic beta cells and they are also thought to exert extra-pancreatic effects, such as increasing the insulin-mediated peripheral glucose uptake.[A177709] 

Glimepiride works by stimulating the secretion of insulin granules from pancreatic islet beta cells by blocking ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATPchannels) and causing depolarization of the beta cells. Compared to [glipizide], another second SU drug, glimepiride has a longer duration of action. It is sometimes classified as a third-generation SU because it has larger substitutions than other second-generation SUs.[A177703] Compared to other SUs, glimepiride was associated with a lower risk of developing hypoglycemia and weight gain in clinical trials [A177709] as well as fewer cardiovascular effects than other SUs due to minimal effects on ischemic preconditioning of cardiac myocytes.[A177703] It is effective in reducing fasting plasma glucose, postprandial glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin levels and is considered to be a useful, cost-effective treatment option for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus.[A177703] Glimepiride was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States in 1995 for the treatment of T2DM. It is commonly marketed under the brand name Amaryl as oral tablets and is typically administered once daily.','["A10BD04", "A10BB12", "A10BD06"]','[]');

Dexlansoprazole is the R-enantiomer of [DB00448], which is composed of a racemic mixture of the R- and S-enantiomers. Compared to the older generation of PPIs (which includes [DB00213], [DB00338], and [DB00448]) [A178084], dexlansoprazole MR has a unique pharmacokinetic profile due to its delayed-release and dual-delivery release system. The active ingredient is released in two phases at different pH values and at different time points, resulting in two peak concentrations in the blood; 25% of the dose is released at pH 5.5 in the proximal duodenum, while the remaining 75% is released at pH 6.75 in the distal small intestine [A19567]. As a result, dexlansoprazole has a peak concentration within 1-2 hours after dosing and another within 4-5 hours [FDA Label]. Dexlansoprazole''s unique pharmacokinetics addresses limitations of the older generation PPIs including short plasma half-life, break-through symptoms, and need for meal-associated dosing [A19568]. These characteristics make dexlansoprazole a good option for people who struggle with adherence and strict dosage timing before meals[A178087, A19566]. 

Dexlansoprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects in the same way as other drugs in the PPI family by inhibiting the final step in gastric acid production. Dexlansoprazole targets the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme, which is involved in the secretion of hydrochloric acid through the exchange of H+ ions from the cytoplasm for K+ ions. Normally functioning (H+, K+)-ATPase stimulates hydrochloric acid secretion into the gastric lumen thereby increasing stomach acidity and lowering pH. Once absorbed into circulation, dexlansoprazole covalently binds to the sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells, which leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion. Despite dexlansoprazole''s unique pharmacokinetic profile, efficacy in management of GERD symptoms is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [DB00338], [DB00736], [DB00448], [DB00213], and [DB01129].

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as dexlansoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life [A177571]. PPIs such as dexlansoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes [A177577, A177580].

Dimenhydrinate, also known as B-dimethylaminoethyl benzohydrol ether 8-chlorotheophyllinate, is indicated to prevent nausea, vomiting, and dizziness caused by motion sickness.[L32980,L32985,L32995] Dimenhydrinate is a combination of [Diphenhydramine] and [8-chlorotheophylline] in a salt form, with 53%-55.5% dried diphenhydramine, and 44%-47% died 8-chlorotheophylline.[L32985]

The antiemetic properties of dimenhydrinate are primarily thought to be produced by diphenhydramine''s antagonism of H1 histamine receptors in the vestibular system[A1540] while the excitatory effects are thought to be produced by 8-chlorotheophylline''s adenosine receptor blockade.[A33889]

It is a potent and selective inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2,[A229698] which are tyrosine kinases involved in cytokine signalling and hematopoiesis.[A7450] Myeloproliferative neoplasms, such as myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera, are often characterized by aberrant activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, leading to abnormal blood cell counts and thrombotic complications. By inhibiting JAK1 and JAK2, ruxolitinib works to block the dysregulated cell signalling pathways and prevents abnormal blood cell proliferation.[A229708] Due to a large number of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms who have JAK2 mutations, ruxolitinib was the first ATP-competitive inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2 ever developed.[A229938]

Ruxolitinib was first approved for the treatment of adult patients with myelofibrosis by the FDA in 2011, followed by EMA''s approval in 2012.[A229708] In 2014, it was approved for the treatment of polycythemia vera in adults who have an inadequate response to or are intolerant of [hydroxyurea] and in 2019, ruxolitinib was approved for use in steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease in adults and children.[L31958] The topical formulation of ruxolitinib is used to treat atopic dermatitis and vitiligo.[L39125] It is being investigated for other inflammatory skin conditions.[A229883]

Ruxolitinib has been investigated to treat patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) accompanied by severe systemic hyperinflammation. In phase II clinical trials, ruxolitinib improved chest computed tomography and improved recovery in patients with lymphopenia.[A229713, A229718] However, phase III clinical trials later determined that ruxolitinib was inadequate in meeting its primary endpoint of reducing the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients who experienced severe complications [L31968] thus the drug was not approved as a treatment for COVID-19.','["L01EJ01"]','[]'),(3928,'Duxil oral drops 48 ml','دوكسيل نقط فم 48 مل','36','','Respiratory stimulant.copd.chemoreceptor agonist','Almitrine+ranbexine','Servier','Drops','نقط','48 ml','1','','','6223003960117','',716,'2023-01-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'R07AB07',NULL),(3929,'Cobalamoun 1000 mcg 30 sublingual tabs.','كوبالامون 1000مكجم 30 قرص تحت اللسان','85','75','Vitamin b12','Methylcobalamin','Amoun','Tab','أقراص','1000 mcg','3','','','6221025047960','',2457,'2025-09-01',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(3931,'Meralgo 20 caps','ميرالجو 20 كبسولة','425','','Dietary supplement','Undenaturated collagen type 2+turmeric rhizome powder+boswellia extract+hyaluronic acid+msm','Copad egypt','Cap','كبسولة','','2','','','6223011340369','https://copadegypt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/meralgo.jpg',9066,'2022-08-17',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(3932,'Troya folic acid 30 capsules','ترويا فوليك اسيد 30 كبسولة','120','','Dietary supplement','Folate+vitamin b12+vitamin b6','Pharma zad > troya pharma','Capsule','كبسولة','','1','','','','',1213,'2025-05-28',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(3933,'Dysport 500unit vial','ديسبورت 500 وحدة فيال','1,960','','','Botulinum toxin','Ipsen limited-england > haya pharm-egypt','Vial','فيال','500unit','1','','','','',2812,'2022-06-15',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'M03AX01',NULL),(3934,'Np plus cream','ان بي بلس كريم','50','','Nipple fissures','','Pixel','Cream','كريم','','1','','','6224001661181','',817,'2025-05-28',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(3935,'Rotamag bisglycinate 30 h.g. caps.','روتاماج بيس جليسينات 30 كبسولة','210','','Magnesium','Magnesium','Rotabiogen','Cap','كبسولة','','1','','','6224011378604','',722,'2022-08-27',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'A small colorless crystal used as an anticonvulsant, a cathartic, and an electrolyte replenisher in the treatment of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.

Structurally, ergocalciferol differs from cholecalciferol in that it possesses a double bond between C22 and C23 and has an additional methyl group at C24 [L5689]. Finally, ergocalciferol is pharmacologically less potent than cholecalciferol, which makes vitamin D3 the preferred agent for medical use [L5689].

Appropriate levels of vitamin D must be upheld in the body in order to maintain calcium and phosphorus levels in a healthy physiologic range to sustain a variety of metabolic functions, transcription regulation, and bone metabolism [A223, L5689, L1782, L5771, F4027, F4042, F4048].

When non-specific references are made about ''vitamin d'', the references are usually about the use of vitamin D3 and/or D2.

Vitamin D3 and D2 require hydroxylation in order to become biologically active in the human body. Since vitamin D can be endogenously synthesized in adequate amounts by most mammals exposed to sufficient quantities of sunlight, vitamin D functions like a hormone on vitamin D receptors to regulate calcium in opposition to parathyroid hormone.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease affecting the peripheral joints. It is characterized by synovial inflammation and hyperplasia, autoantibody production, cartilage damage and bone destruction, leading to co-morbidities.[A189165] Despite a variety of therapeutic agents available for treatment, up to 40% of the patients do not respond to current therapies, including biological therapies.[A189171] The etiology of the disease is mostly unknown; however, the role of JAK as a driver of immune-mediated conditions was discovered, leading to the use of JAK as therapeutic targets for rheumatoid arthritis.[A189168] To reduce dose-related toxicity (as seen with some pan-JAK inhibitors) without significantly affecting efficacy, more selective JAK1 inhibitors, upadacitinib and [filgotinib], were developed.[A189165]

It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infections along with other antibiotics including [DB01060], [DB01211], and [DB00916], for example.[A177271, F4498] Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [DB00338], [DB00213], [DB00448], [DB05351], and [DB01129]. Esomeprazole is the s-isomer of [DB00338], which is a racemate of the S- and R-enantiomer. Esomeprazole has been shown to inhibit acid secretion to a similar extent as [DB00338], without any significant differences between the two compounds _in vitro_. 

Esomeprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of esomeprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, esomeprazole''s duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]

PPIs such as esomeprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as esomeprazole has been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients such as iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]

Rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as esomeprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion.[A177574] Esomeprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing to prevent this rebound effect.','["A02BD06", "A02BC05", "M01AE52"]','[]'),(4167,'Enalapril maleate 20mg 10 tab','اينالابريل ماليات 20مجم 10 اقراص','9','','Antihypertensive.ace','Enalapril','October pharma','Tab','أقراص','20mg','1','علاج لمرض ارتفاع ضغط الدم','','6221088010161','',2269,'2023-05-19',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Enalapril is a prodrug belonging to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor drug class that works on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which is responsible for the regulation of blood pressure and fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. Enalapril is an orally-active and long-acting nonsulphydryl antihypertensive agent that suppresses the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to lower blood pressure. It was developed from a targeted research programmed using molecular modelling.[A18459] Being a prodrug, enalapril is rapidly biotransformed into its active metabolite, [enalaprilat], which is responsible for the pharmacological actions of enalapril. The active metabolite of enalapril competitively inhibits the ACE to hinder the production of angiotensin II, a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system that promotes vasoconstriction and renal reabsorption of sodium ions in the kidneys. Ultimately, enalaprilat works to reduce blood pressure and blood fluid volume.

Commonly marketed under the trade name Vasotec, enalapril was first approved by the FDA in 1985 for the management of hypertension, heart failure, and asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. It is also found in a combination product containing [hydrochlorothiazide] that is used for the management of hypertension.

Methyldopa works by binding to alpha(α)-2 adrenergic receptors as an agonist, leading to the inhibition of adrenergic neuronal outflow and reduction of vasoconstrictor adrenergic signals.[A1499] Methyldopa exists in two isomers D-α-methyldopa and L-α-methyldopa, which is the active form.[A232224]

ARBs selectively bind to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) and prevent the protein angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects, which include vasoconstriction, stimulation and synthesis of aldosterone and ADH, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, among others. Overall, olmesartan''s physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium. 

Olmesartan also affects the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays an important role in hemostasis and regulation of kidney, vascular, and cardiac functions. Pharmacological blockade of RAAS via  AT1 receptor blockade inhibits negative regulatory feedback within RAAS, which is a contributing factor to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal disease. In particular, heart failure is associated with chronic activation of RAAS, leading to inappropriate fluid retention, vasoconstriction, and ultimately a further decline in left ventricular function. ARBs have been shown to have a protective effect on the heart by improving cardiac function, reducing afterload, increasing cardiac output and preventing ventricular hypertrophy and remodelling.[A174154] 

By comparison, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) class of medications (which includes drugs such as [ramipril], [lisinopril], and [perindopril]) inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II through inhibition of the ACE enzyme. However, this does not prevent the formation of all angiotensin II within the body. The angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs unique in that it blocks all angiotensin II activity, regardless of where or how it was synthesized. 

Olmesartan is commonly used for the management of hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes-associated nephropathy, particularly in patients who are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors. ARBs such as olmesartan have been shown in a number of large-scale clinical outcomes trials to improve cardiovascular outcomes including reducing risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, the progression of heart failure, and hospitalization.[A174124,A178153,A173869,A185324,A185327,A185333,A185342,A185345] Like other ARBs, olmesartan blockade of RAAS slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy due to its renoprotective effects.[A185906,A185909,A185912] 

Orally available olmesartan is produced as the prodrug olmesartan medoxomil which is rapidly converted _in vivo_ to the pharmacologically active olmesartan.[A175330] It was developed by Daiichi Sankyo Pharmaceuticals and approved in 2002.[A175345, L12882]','["C09DA08", "C09DX03", "C09CA08", "C09DB02"]','[]'),(4332,'Erastapex co 5/40mg 30 f.c. tabs.','ايراستابكس كو 5/40 مجم 30 قرص','144','108','Antihypertensive','Olmesartan+amlodipine','Multi-apex','Tab','أقراص','40mg','3','علاج ضغط الدم المرتفع','','6223003205638','',8473,'2024-08-22',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(4333,'Erastapex trio 10/40/25mg 30 f.c. tabs.','ايراستابكس تريو 10/40/25مجم 30 قرص','162','123','Antihypertensive.combined angiotensin blocker & ca++ channel blocker & diuretic','Amlodipine+olmesartan+hydrochlorothiazide','Multi-apex','Tab','أقراص','25mg','3','علاج ضغط الدم المرتفع','pharmacology olmesartan: blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin ii. amlodipine: directly acts on vascular smooth muscle to produce peripheral arterial vasodilation reducing peripheral vascular resistance and blood pres','6223003205577','',21969,'2024-10-10',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(4334,'Erastapex plus 20mg/12.5mg 30 tab','ايراستابكس بلس 20/12.5مجم 30 قرص','78','55.5','Antihypertensive','Olmesratan+hydrochlorothiazide','Multi-apex','Tab','أقراص','20mg','3','علاج ضغط الدم المرتفع','','6223003202781','',13048,'2024-07-02',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(4335,'Erastapex trio 5/20/12.5mg 30 f.c. tab','ايراستابكس تريو 5/20/12.5مجم 30 قرص','114','87','Antihypertensive','Olmesratan+amlodipine+hydrochlorothiazide','Multi-apex','Tab','أقراص','12.5mg','3','علاج ضغط الدم المرتفع','','6223003205546','',16368,'2024-10-13',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(4336,'Erastapex plus 40mg/12.5mg 30 tab','ايراستابكس بلس 40/12.5مجم 30 قرص','96','69','Antihypertensive','Olmesartan+hydrochlorothiazide','Multi-apex','Tab','أقراص','40mg','3','علاج ضغط الدم المرتفع','','6223003202811','',5024,'2024-06-06',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(4337,'Normelan body whitening lotion 100 ml','نورميلان لوشن 100 مل','440','','Skin care.whitening','','Green pharmaceutical','Lotion','لوشن','100 ml','1','','','','',771,'2025-06-17',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(4339,'Normelan lightening face cream 30 ml','نورميلان كريم 30 مل','350','','Skin care.whitening','','Green pharmaceutical','Cream','كريم','30 ml','1','','','','',923,'2025-06-17',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(4340,'Solitract compound 6/0.4mg 20 f.c. tabs','سوليتراكت كومبوند 6/0.4مجم 20 قرص','144','','','Solifenacin+tamsulosin','Eva pharma','Tab','أقراص','0.4mg','2','','','6224010273535','',1225,'2025-06-17',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(4341,'Erectalis 20 mg 2 f.c. tab','اريكتاليس 20مجم 2 قرص','74','50','Tonic for men','Tadalafil','Penta pharma-egypt','Tab','أقراص','20 mg','2','مقوي للرجال','','6224007738191','',11359,'2025-02-18',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Tadalafil is a selective phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor that is used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and benign prostatic hypertrophy.[L39100, L39105] It was first approved in 2003 by the FDA for use in ED and later in 2009 for PAH.

The result of doing so allows cGMP present in both the penis and pulmonary vasculature to elicit smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation that subsequently facilitates relief in pulmonary arterial hypertension and the increased flow of blood into the spongy erectile tissue of the penis that consequently allows it to grow in size and become erect and rigid [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

Interestingly enough, it is precisely via this mechanism why sildenafil was at first researched as a potential treatment for angina - or chest pain associated with inadequate blood flow to the heart - before being serendipitously indicated for treating erectile dysfunction in the late 1980s [A175732]. Nevertheless, it is because of this mechanism that sildenafil is also indicated for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension but is also additionally notorious for interacting with various anti-anginal or anti-hypertensive agents to develop potentially rapid, excessive, and/or fatal hypotensive crises [A175579, A175582, A175654].

Regardless, sildenafil, among a variety of other similar or related PDE5 inhibitors, has become a common and effective treatment for erectile dysfunction and since its formal approval for medical use in the public in 1998 [A175732], continues to see millions of prescriptions written for it internationally. Although the medication has historically been most popularly recognized as Pfizer''s brand name Viagra, sildenafil is currently available generically and even as a non-prescription over the counter medication in some countries [L5656].','["G01AE10", "G04BE03"]','[]'),(4347,'Eros cream 15 gm','ايروس كريم 15 جرام','68','','Delay for men','','England','Cream','كريم','15 gm','1','','','','',3625,'2022-08-17',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(4348,'Norvasc val 10/160mg 30 f.c.tabs','نورفاسك فال 10/160 مجم 30 قرص','174','','Anti-hypertensive. combined angiotensin blocker with calcium channel blocker','Amlodipine+valsartan','Viatris egypt','Tab','أقراص','160mg','3','','','','',822,'2025-06-17',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(4349,'Norvasc val 5/160mg 30 f.c.tabs.','نورفاسك فال 5/160 مجم 30 قرص','168','','Anti-hypertensive. combined angiotensin blocker with calcium channel blocker','Amlodipine+valsartan','Viatris egypt','Tab','أقراص','160mg','3','','','','',769,'2025-06-17',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(4350,'Norvasc val 5/80mg 30 f.c.tabs.','نورفاسك فال 5/80 مجم 30 قرص','132','','Anti-hypertensive. combined angiotensin blocker with calcium channel blocker','Amlodipine+valsartan','Viatris egypt','Tab','أقراص','80mg','3','','','6223005920072','',928,'2025-06-17',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(4351,'Novapantolix 20 mg 14 del. rel. tabs.','نوفابانتوليكس 20مجم 14 قرص','70','','Peptic ulcer.proton pump inhibitor','Pantoprazole','Zeta pharma','Tab','أقراص','20 mg','2','','','','',787,'2025-06-17',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Pantoprazole is a first-generation proton pump inhibitor (PPI) used for the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), for gastric protection to prevent recurrence of stomach ulcers or gastric damage from chronic use of NSAIDs, and for the treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions including Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) Syndrome. It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infections along with other antibiotics including [amoxicillin], [clarithromycin], and [metronidazole], for example.[A177271][F4498] Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [omeprazole], [esomeprazole], [lansoprazole], [dexlansoprazole], and [rabeprazole].

Pantoprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cell. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of pantoprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, pantoprazole''s duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as pantoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]

PPIs such as pantoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]

Pantoprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing as rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as pantoprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion.[A177574]','["A02BD04", "A02BD11", "A02BC02"]','[]'),(4352,'Nubeqa 300 mg 112 f.c. tabs.','نوبيكا 300 مجم 112 قرص','56,939','','Androgen receptor inhibitor','Darolutamide','Bayer','Tab','أقراص','300 mg','1','','','','',939,'2025-06-17',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Darolutamide is a nonsteroidal androgen receptor antagonist for the treatment of castrate-resistant, non-metastatic prostate cancer (nmCRPC).
