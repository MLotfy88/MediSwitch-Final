      "text": "Rather than typical \"ABC\" approach to trauma assessment, TCCC prioritizes massive hemorrhage\nMARCH acronym is used to prioritize treatment:\nM\n- Massive hemorrhage\nEmphasize early recognition of significant bleeding. Apply limb\ntourniquets\nhigh, tight, and early. For junctional injuries, utilize direct pressure or hemostatic agents while waiting for OR.\nA\n- Airway\nConsider triage given limited management resources. May require surgical airway if significant facial or oropharyngeal injuries are present.\nR\n- Respiration\nRecognize and manage pneumothoraces with needle or chest tube thoracostomy. Consider chest seals for chest cavity wounds.\nC\n- Circulation\nReevaluate for peripheral pulses,\ntourniquets\nthat need to be replaced, and hemorrhage management deferred during \"M.\" Consider eFAST exam.\nH\n- Head/Hypothermia\nEvaluate for head injury, including mental status and GCS. Treat hypothermia.",
