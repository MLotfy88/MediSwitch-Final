Modafinil and armodafinil are modest inducers of CYP450 3A4, and pharmacokinetic studies suggest that their effects may be primarily intestinal rather than hepatic. Thus, clinically significant interactions would most likely be expected with drugs that have low oral bioavailability due to significant intestinal CYP450 3A4-mediated first-pass metabolism (e.g., buspirone, cyclosporine, lovastatin, midazolam, saquinavir, simvastatin, sirolimus, tacrolimus, triazolam, calcium channel blockers). However, the potential for interaction should be considered with any drug metabolized by CYP450 3A4, especially given the high degree of interpatient variability with respect to CYP450-mediated metabolism.

Toxicity has been reported. The proposed mechanism is inhibition of CYP450 3A4 metabolism. In addition, phenytoin may significantly decrease calcium channel blocker (CCB) serum levels by inducing first-pass metabolism and the systemic clearance. Other hydantoins may participate in these interactions as well.', 'DDInter', 'Close clinical and laboratory observation for evidence of altered effect of both drugs is recommended if a CCB and a hydantoin must be used together. Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they experience symptoms of phenytoin toxicity (e.g., drowsiness, visual disturbances, change in mental status, seizures, nausea, or ataxia) or loss of effect of their CCB.', 'Metabolism', 'Close clinical and laboratory observation for evidence of altered effect of both drugs is recommended if a CCB and a hydantoin must be used together.', 'Moderate', 'pharmacodynamic', NULL, 'https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/94949/', '[1] Bahls FH, Ozuna J, Ritchie DE "Interactions between calcium channel blockers and the anticonvulsants carbamazepine and phenytoin."
