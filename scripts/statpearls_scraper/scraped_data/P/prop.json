    "clinical_significance": "The instruments reviewed are fundamental to many oral surgical procedures. As such, it is necessary to be aware of their existence, appreciate the clinical situations they are used in, and understand how they can be applied. This knowledge facilitates their safe use, as improper instrumentation in combination with uncontrolled excessive force can have detrimental effects such as iatrogenic fracture of the mandible.\n[35]\n\nThis reading should be supplemented with practical experience as one method for a particular procedure does not always work in another clinician's hands. Several different instruments can often be used in the same clinical scenario, and clinicians develop a preference.",
    "monitoring": "Four-handed dentistry can be utilized to maximize efficiency during oral surgical procedures. The dental nurse recognizes the instrument required next or is instructed by the dental practitioner and then provides this to them.\n[39]\nA sound understanding of oral surgical instruments is imperative as there are usually many instruments on the tray, and delays in treatment can result if the assistant cannot identify each instrument and pass it to the operator in good time. Additionally, the wider team must know various instruments to identify faulty pieces and report and replace them."
