Alternative or additional methods of birth control should be used during and for at least two weeks after short-term and 4 weeks after long-term (greater than 4 weeks) St. John's wort therapy.  If a combination oral contraceptive pill is used, a regimen containing at least 50 mcg of ethinyl estradiol per day or equivalent should be selected.  Although breakthrough bleeding is not necessarily indicative of low ethinyl estradiol serum levels or increased risk of ovulation, some clinicians suggest that women who experience breakthrough bleeding during enzyme-inducing therapy may be prescribed an increased dose of ethinyl estradiol above 50 mcg daily by combining more than one formulation of contraceptive pill if necessary.  For emergency contraception in patients who have used an hepatic enzyme inducer in the past 4 weeks, a non-hormonal emergency contraceptive (e.g., copper intrauterine device) is considered preferable.  If this is not possible, some authorities recommend that the usual dose of levonorgestrel (1.5 mg) should be doubled to 3 mg and taken as a single dose as soon as possible (within 72 hours of unprotected sexual intercourse).  However, there are no data on efficacy, compliance, or side effects of this regimen.  For women with the etonogestrel subdermal implant, the addition of a barrier method is recommended during concomitant use and for 28 days after discontinuation of hepatic enzyme inducing drugs.  It is recommended to remove the implant and to prescribe a nonhormonal method in women who require long-term treatment with hepatic enzyme inducing drugs.  No precautions or recommendations are available for women using hormone-releasing intrauterine systems, but a significant interaction with these systems is thought to be unlikely due to their local action.

The potential risk for serotonin syndrome should be considered even when administering serotonergic agents sequentially, as some agents may demonstrate a prolonged elimination half-life.  For example, some experts suggest a 5-week washout period following use of fluoxetine and 3 weeks following the use of vortioxetine before administering another serotonergic agent.  Individual product labeling for washout periods should be consulted for current recommendations.  If serotonin syndrome develops or is suspected during the course of therapy, all serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately and supportive care rendered as necessary.  Moderately ill patients may also benefit from the administration of a serotonin antagonist (e.g., cyproheptadine, chlorpromazine).

For rabies vaccine, some authorities suggest that immunosuppressive agents should generally be avoided during postexposure therapy except when absolutely necessary for the treatment of other conditions.  For SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) vaccines, vaccination should preferably be completed at least two weeks before initiation or resumption of immunosuppressive therapies; however, decisions to delay or temporarily withhold immunosuppressive therapy to complete COVID-19 vaccination should consider the individual's risks relative to their underlying condition.  Additional shots and/or boosters may be appropriate depending on age, prior COVID-19 vaccine formulation(s) received, and other factors in individuals with moderate to severe immune compromise due to medical conditions or immunosuppressive medications or treatments (e.g., solid organ transplant recipients on immunosuppressive therapy; patients on active treatment for solid tumor and hematologic malignancies).
