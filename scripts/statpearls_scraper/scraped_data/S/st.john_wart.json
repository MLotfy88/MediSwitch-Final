    "indications": "The few contraindications to the use of antipsychotic drugs include tardive dyskinesia, parkinsonism, and previous neuroleptic malignant syndrome. In older patients diagnosed with dementia, there is an FDA-boxed warning describing a severe reaction to antipsychotics leading to death. Caution is necessary when using antipsychotics in the presence of a prolactinoma, as there is a significant concern that a dopamine antagonist can cause a pituitary prolactinoma to enlarge. In patients with Tay Sachs disease (hexosaminidase-A deficiency), findings suggest that antipsychotic drugs deplete hexosaminidase-A and worsen the course of the disease. Some other contraindications to the use of antipsychotics are glaucoma, liver disease, severe neutropenia, or bone marrow depression.\n[32]\n[33]\n[34]\n\nPimavanserin is exclusively indicated for addressing hallucinations and delusions linked to Parkinson's disease psychosis. Pimavanserin is not approved for addressing psychosis in patients with dementia unless it is associated with Parkinson's disease.\n[35]\nThe Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) recommends against the routine utilization of haloperidol or atypical antipsychotics to prevent or reduce the duration of delirium in critically ill pediatric patients, as per a conditional low recommendation. However, in cases of refractory delirium, the SCCM suggests considering haloperidol or atypical antipsychotics for managing severe delirium manifestations, with caution regarding potential adverse drug effects, according to a conditional moderate recommendation. Furthermore, the SCCM recommends performing a baseline electrocardiogram followed by routine electrolyte and QTc interval monitoring for patients receiving haloperidol or atypical antipsychotics.\n[36]",
    "mechanism": "Second-generation antipsychotics such as risperidone, ziprasidone, paliperidone, and aripiprazole are all strong antagonists of dopamine D2 receptors, while clozapine and quetiapine are weak D2 antagonists. These antipsychotics also have additional properties, such as 5-HT2A antagonism and 5-HT1A agonism. Atypical antipsychotics also have antidepressant properties in combination with other antidepressants and when administered alone. Mechanisms linked to antidepressant actions include serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition. Quetiapine and ziprasidone have weak binding at these sites. The antagonism of alpha-2 (α2) receptors is the mechanism of drugs such as quetiapine, clozapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole; each has variable degrees of potency.\n\nAtypical antipsychotics with D2 antagonism and partial agonism combined with 5-HT2A antagonism are more effective for treating mania, and these include aripiprazole, quetiapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and asenapine. Antipsychotics also have histamine, muscarinic (cholinergic), and α-adrenergic antagonism. Almost all atypical antipsychotics bind to α-adrenergic receptors, but the most potent are clozapine, risperidone, iloperidone, and clozapine. Quetiapine, clozapine, and olanzapine have high anticholinergic properties, whereas other atypical antipsychotics very weakly bind to muscarinic cholinergic receptors.\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\nSamidorphan, an opioid receptor antagonist, has been co-formulated with olanzapine into a single-dose oral tablet to alleviate the risk of weight gain while maintaining olanzapine's therapeutic efficacy.\n[24]\nThe mechanism by which pimavanserin is effective in delusion and hallucinations associated with Parkinson's disease psychosis remains uncertain; its efficacy may result from its dual action as an inverse agonist and antagonist at serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, alongside a lesser impact on serotonin 5-HT2C receptors.\n\nPharmacokinetics\n\nMetabolism:\nAripiprazole undergoes primary metabolism through CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes, forming active dehydro-aripiprazole. Iloperidone undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism involving carbonyl reduction, hydroxylation via CYP2D6, and O-demethylation mediated by CYP3A4, forming active metabolites. Lurasidone is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4, producing 2 active metabolites. Olanzapine is highly metabolized through direct glucuronidation via UGT1A4 and oxidation mediated by CYP1A2, yielding inactive metabolites. Paliperidone undergoes hepatic metabolism mainly via CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, with additional minor pathways involved. Quetiapine is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, with metabolism decreasing by approximately 30% with age progression. Risperidone undergoes extensive metabolism via CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Ziprasidone undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism, with less than one-third mediated by CYP3A4 and CYP1A2.\n[25]",
    "administration": "Atypical antipsychotics are available in a variety of formulations, including immediate-release injectable (IM), long-acting injectable (IM), and orally disintegrating tablets in addition to the customary oral tablets. None of the atypical antipsychotics are administrated intravenously. Immediate-release injectables are used in emergencies when a patient is highly agitated or acutely psychotic, including olanzapine and ziprasidone. The long-acting injectables include aripiprazole, olanzapine, paliperidone, and risperidone, administered at 2 to 4-week intervals. Oral dosing is the preferred course of administration in most patients. The orally disintegrating tablets include aripiprazole, asenapine, clozapine, olanzapine, and risperidone, identical to the standard tablets regarding absorption and bioavailability.",
    "adverse_effects": "Atypical antipsychotics can cause adverse effects of weight gain, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, QTc prolongation, extrapyramidal side effects, myocarditis, agranulocytosis, cataracts, and sexual adverse effects, which this activity will discuss here. Treatment with second-generation antipsychotics can contribute to weight gain and metabolic syndrome with high blood sugar, hypertension, abnormal cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations, placing a patient at risk for stroke, myocardial disease, and diabetes mellitus. The mean increase in weight over a 10-week period for patients treated with standard doses of atypical antipsychotics was 4.45 kg with clozapine and 4.15 kg with olanzapine. Weight gain was not as significant with other antipsychotics; data on quetiapine has been variable.\n\nData from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) study suggest an association between olanzapine and an increased and substantial adverse effect on triglycerides and lipids. Ziprasidone was the only second-generation antipsychotic not associated with metabolic syndrome. Numerous studies suggest that certain atypical antipsychotics, especially clozapine and olanzapine, are associated with diabetes mellitus. Patients can also demonstrate increased serum triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations with clozapine, olanzapine, and quetiapine.\n\nIn the CATIE study, ziprasidone was the only antipsychotic associated with improved triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations. In contrast, olanzapine was associated with greater and adverse effects of these metabolic variables. QTc prolongation is another adverse effect of antipsychotics. The CATIE study showed no difference in the effects of olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, and ziprasidone. However, a recent focus is on ziprasidone and its impact on QTc prolongation, especially when the medication administration takes place with a drug that inhibits its metabolism.\n[26]\n\nMyocarditis is another adverse effect, especially associated with the use of clozapine. Evidence suggests that clozapine is associated with a low risk of fatal myocarditis. The medication would require discontinuation, and the patient should be monitored closely for any signs and symptoms of cardiomyopathy or myocarditis. Sexual side effects are also common because of the drug's effect on dopaminergic, alpha1 and alpha2 adrenergic, and H1 histamine receptors. Antipsychotic-induced sexual dysfunction is mainly related to the D2 receptor blockade in the pituitary gland, leading to an excess of prolactin. Hyperprolactinemia is associated with menstrual and sexual dysfunction, and therefore, consideration should be given to switching to a medication that is prolactin-sparing, such as aripiprazole. Atypical antipsychotics are typically associated with fewer extrapyramidal side effects when compared to typical antipsychotics. Antipsychotics have an FDA-boxed warning of increased death in older patients with psychoses related to dementia.\n[27]\n[21]\n[28]\n\nPimavanserin carries a risk of QT interval prolongation and, therefore, should not be administered to individuals with a history of cardiac dysrhythmias. Adverse reactions observed with pimavanserin include rash, urticaria, and angioedema.\n[29]\n[30]\n\nDrug-Drug Interactions\n\nAripiprazole: CYP3A4 inducers lower aripiprazole levels, while CYP3A4 inhibitors increase levels. Ketoconazole and quinidine decrease aripiprazole metabolism. Carbamazepine reduces aripiprazole and metabolite levels.\n\nAsenapine: Fluvoxamine increases plasma concentration of asenapine. Asenapine, a CYP2D6 inhibitor, increases paroxetine levels.\n\nClozapine: Fluoxetine may increase clozapine and norclozapine levels through CYP2D6 inhibition. Fluvoxamine inhibits CYP1A2, leading to increased levels of clozapine. Paroxetine significantly increases plasma clozapine and norclozapine levels. Sertraline may also increase plasma clozapine levels. Phenytoin may reduce serum clozapine concentrations. Dose adjustments may be necessary for highly protein-bound drugs like digoxin and warfarin.\n\nIloperidone: Concurrent administration of strong CYP2D6 inhibitors like quinidine, fluoxetine, and paroxetine necessitates a dosage reduction. Similarly, the presence of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors requires a dosage decrease. Additionally, individuals identified as poor CYP2D6 metabolizers should undergo a dose reduction.\n\nLurasidone: Lurasidone should be avoided with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, clarithromycin, and voriconazole and strong CYP3A4 inducers like rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St John's wart. Dose reduction is recommended with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice should be avoided.\n\nOlanzapine: Diazepam and alcohol have the potential to potentiate orthostatic hypotension. Carbamazepine can increase the clearance of olanzapine, and smoking increases olanzapine clearance. Caution should be exercised when combining olanzapine with other centrally-acting drugs and alcohol, emphasizing the need for careful consideration and monitoring.\n\nPaliperidone: Carbamazepine, a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and P-gp, decreases the AUC of paliperidone. Paroxetine, a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, may increase paliperidone levels. Divalproex sodium ER formulation increases Cmax and AUC.\n\nQuetiapine: Inducers such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, and St. John's wort increase quetiapine clearance. Dose adjustments are advised upon discontinuation of strong CYP3A4 inducers.\n\nRisperidone: Carbamazepine and other inducers necessitate an increased dosage. Concurrent administration of risperidone with CYP2D6 inhibitors like fluoxetine and paroxetine requires a dosage reduction of risperidone.\n\nPimavanserin: Pimavanserin may require dose adjustment when used concurrently with potent CYP3A inhibitors. This drug's efficacy might be diminished when administered alongside strong CYP3A inducers.\n\nLumateperone: Co-administration of lumateperone with moderate or strong CYP3A4 and UGT inhibitors should be avoided, as it heightens the risk of toxicity. Similarly, combining lumateperone with inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A4 is contraindicated due to the potential for increased lumateperone concentrations.\n[25]\n[31]",
    "monitoring": "The patient should be closely monitored for adverse effects mentioned above when starting atypical antipsychotics. The baseline body mass index should be recorded before treatment with atypical antipsychotics and at every visit for at least 6 months. The patient’s weight circumference also needs monitoring, and intervention may be necessary if there is an increase in 1 body mass index unit. The patient should receive counseling in nutrition, possible initiation of a weight loss program, use of medication to help with weight loss, and/or consider switching to another antipsychotic with less weight gain. Monitoring weight gain alone may not be sufficient for assessing diabetes mellitus risk. The tests used to evaluate the risk of diabetes mellitus include random glucose, fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and oral glucose tolerance tests. A baseline lipid panel and EKG are also necessary before the initiation of atypical antipsychotics. Clozapine can cause severe neutropenia; thus, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) needs to be monitored.\n[37]\n[38]\n[39]",
    "toxicity": "Atypical antipsychotics block a variety of neurotransmitter receptors, which vary from one drug to another and are responsible for any toxic effects from an overdose. By blocking dopamine receptors, second-generation antipsychotics can cause extrapyramidal symptoms and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, although to a lesser extent, compared to a typical antipsychotic, eg, haloperidol. Alpha-adrenergic blockade causes orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia via vasodilation. Olanzapine, clozapine, aripiprazole, and quetiapine cause significant anti-alpha-adrenergic effects. Almost all atypical agents block serotonin receptors, and several inhibit muscarinic receptors. Quetiapine, clozapine, and olanzapine are powerful anti-muscarinic agents, and toxicity can cause urinary retention, tachycardia, hyperthermia, and delirium. Many second-generation antipsychotics also cause significant sedation by antihistamine activity; these agents are aripiprazole, quetiapine, clozapine, and olanzapine. Olanzapine causes central nervous system depression, hypotension, sedation, and sometimes agitation and is rarely lethal in monotherapy overdose.\n\nOn the other hand, clozapine can sometimes be lethal in overdose by causing respiratory depression, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, changes in heart rhythm, and altered mental status. In overdose, quetiapine is rarely fatal; however, it correlates with the highest mortality rate of all antipsychotics as it successfully blocks muscarinic, alpha-adrenergic, and histamine receptors. Toxicity with quetiapine presents with tachycardia, delirium, central nervous system depression, and rarely fatal ventricular arrhythmia. There are no reported fatalities with aripiprazole, and symptoms of overdose with ziprasidone include tachycardia, QTc prolongation, and central nervous system depression, and toxicity is seldom lethal.\n[40]\n[41]"
