Clinically significant blood pressure increases have been reported during estrogen therapy, particularly in patients receiving high dosages or treated with oral contraceptive combinations having high progestational activity.  These effects also increase with duration of therapy and patient age.  Therapy with estrogens should be administered cautiously in patients with preexisting hypertension.  Patients should be monitored for changes in cardiovascular status, and their antihypertensive regimen adjusted or estrogen therapy withdrawn as necessary.

The use of estrogen-containing oral contraceptives is additionally deemed contraindicated in patients with a history of such disorders and/or current cerebrovascular or coronary artery disease.  Females with a history of migraines with aura are at an increased risk for stroke and this stroke risk may be further increased in females who have migraines with aura with use of combination oral contraceptives.  Hypercoagulability and changes in various clotting factors and blood components have been observed in women receiving estrogen therapy.  Although the clinical significance of these effects is unknown, epidemiological data suggest it may be dose-dependent.  The risk is probably slight with the use of newer, low-dose oral contraceptives in the absence of known risk factors (e.g., smoker, particularly over the age of 35; hypertension; hyperlipidemia; obesity; diabetes; age over 40).  However, a much more significant risk has been reported with higher dosages, such as those used to treat prostate or metastatic breast cancer or those used in older formulations of birth control pills.  Therapy with estrogens should be administered cautiously in the lowest effective dosage and only after careful consideration of risks and benefits.

The use of estrogen-containing oral contraceptives is additionally deemed contraindicated in patients with a history of such disorders and/or current cerebrovascular or coronary artery disease.  Females with a history of migraines with aura are at an increased risk for stroke and this stroke risk may be further increased in females who have migraines with aura with use of combination oral contraceptives.  Hypercoagulability and changes in various clotting factors and blood components have been observed in women receiving estrogen therapy.  Although the clinical significance of these effects is unknown, epidemiological data suggest it may be dose-dependent.  The risk is probably slight with the use of newer, low-dose oral contraceptives in the absence of known risk factors (e.g., smoker, particularly over the age of 35; hypertension; hyperlipidemia; obesity; diabetes; age over 40).  However, a much more significant risk has been reported with higher dosages, such as those used to treat prostate or metastatic breast cancer or those used in older formulations of birth control pills.  Therapy with estrogens should be administered cautiously in the lowest effective dosage and only after careful consideration of risks and benefits.

The use of estrogen-containing oral contraceptives is additionally deemed contraindicated in patients with a history of such disorders and/or current cerebrovascular or coronary artery disease.  Females with a history of migraines with aura are at an increased risk for stroke and this stroke risk may be further increased in females who have migraines with aura with use of combination oral contraceptives.  Hypercoagulability and changes in various clotting factors and blood components have been observed in women receiving estrogen therapy.  Although the clinical significance of these effects is unknown, epidemiological data suggest it may be dose-dependent.  The risk is probably slight with the use of newer, low-dose oral contraceptives in the absence of known risk factors (e.g., smoker, particularly over the age of 35; hypertension; hyperlipidemia; obesity; diabetes; age over 40).  However, a much more significant risk has been reported with higher dosages, such as those used to treat prostate or metastatic breast cancer or those used in older formulations of birth control pills.  Therapy with estrogens should be administered cautiously in the lowest effective dosage and only after careful consideration of risks and benefits.

Potassium and magnesium depletion may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.  Other electrolyte-related complications include metabolic alkalosis and hyponatremia, which are rarely life-threatening.  Excessive diuresis, as indicated by rapid weight loss, may induce dehydration and hypovolemia, which can result in acute hypotension, orthostasis, circulatory collapse, vascular thrombosis and embolism, and abrupt reduction in glomerular filtration and renal blood flow.  Severe dehydration is most likely to occur in the elderly and patients under prolonged sodium restriction.  Therapy with loop diuretics should be administered cautiously in patients with or predisposed to fluid and electrolyte depletion, including patients with primary or secondary aldosteronism (may have low potassium levels); those with severe or prolonged diarrhea or vomiting; and those with poor nutritional status.  Fluid and electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected before initiating therapy, and blood pressure as well as serum electrolyte concentrations monitored periodically and maintained at normal ranges during therapy.  Patients should be advised to immediately report signs and symptoms of fluid or electrolyte imbalance, including dry mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, arrhythmia, or gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting.  Digitalized patients and patients with a history of ventricular arrhythmias should be monitored carefully, since the development of hypokalemia may be particularly dangerous in these patients.  The risk of hypokalemia may be minimized by slow diuresis, a lower diuretic dosage, potassium supplementation, or combined use with a potassium-sparing diuretic.

Caution is also advised if NSAIDs are prescribed to patients with other factors that increase risk of GI bleeding, such as:  prolonged NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), anticoagulants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; alcohol use; smoking; history of gastrointestinal surgery or anastomosis, older age; poor general health status; and advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy.

This risk may occur early in treatment and may increase with duration of use.  Clinical trials of several cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to 3 years duration have supported this increased risk.  It is unclear from available data if the risk for cardiovascular thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs.  Therapy with NSAIDs should be administered cautiously in patients with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease.  Patients should be treated with the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration necessary.  Appropriate antiplatelet therapy should be administered to patients requiring cardioprotection; however, there is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events associated with NSAID use, while the risk of serious gastrointestinal events is increased.  Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of adverse cardiovascular events throughout the entire duration of therapy, even without prior cardiovascular symptoms.  Patients should be advised to promptly seek medical attention if they experience symptoms of cardiovascular thrombotic events (including chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, or slurring of speech).NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
