      "text": "Localize FB on XR or Fluoro, if available\nGive sedation as needed (ketamine is ideal in kids)\nPlace patient in Trendelenberg, supine, lat decub, or prone\nCheck balloon for symmetric inflation\nFor a child, advance a 12-16F foley orally with balloon deflated\nAdvance tip distal to object (if fluoro is used, inject with contrast to view tip)\nInflate balloon with 3-5 cc saline\nStop inflation if patient complains of pain\nApply gentle traction to bring coin proximally\nTerminate attempt if there is excessive friction\nIf the balloon slips past the object, try again with an additional 1-2cc saline in balloon\nOnce coin is in mouth grab with forceps or ask patient to expectorate it\nIf no FB is removed, obtain another XR to see if the object passed to the stomach or moved.",
