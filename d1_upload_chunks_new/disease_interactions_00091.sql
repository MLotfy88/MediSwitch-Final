Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia may augment the prolongation effect of these agents on the QT interval and should be corrected prior to institution of therapy.  In addition, patients who experience frequent, severe, or prolonged diarrhea may be subject to electrolyte losses and should be followed closely and managed accordingly during therapy with these agents.  Atypical antipsychotic agents should be avoided in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias or other conditions that may increase the risk of torsade de pointes and/or sudden death, including bradycardia; hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia; and congenital long QT syndrome.', '3', '', 'DDInter', 0);
