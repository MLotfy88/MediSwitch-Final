More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Simvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] Increasing use of the statin class of drugs is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, [rosuvastatin] is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg [rosuvastatin] per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels, while simvastatin has been found to have an average decrease in LDL-C of ~35%.[A181409,A181535,A181538,A1793] Potency is thought to correlate to tissue permeability as the more lipophilic statins such as simvastatin are thought to enter endothelial cells by passive diffusion, as opposed to hydrophilic statins such as [pravastatin] and [rosuvastatin] which are taken up into hepatocytes through OATP1B1 (organic anion transporter protein 1B1)-mediated transport.[A181424,A181460] Despite these differences in potency, several trials have demonstrated only minimal differences in terms of clinical outcomes between statins.[A181427]','["A10BH51", "C10AA01", "C10BX04", "C10BA02", "C10BX01", "C10BA04"]','[]'),(27012,'Simvacor 80mg 7 f.c.tab.','سيمفاكور 80مجم 7 اقراص','42','','Antihyperlipidemic.statins','Simvastatin','Sigma','Tab','أقراص','80mg','1','','about simvastatin statins hmg-coa reductase inhibitor a hypolipidemic agent. mechanism of action of simvastatin it is a precursor lactone converted in to active form in the body which competitively inhibits the conversion of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl co','6221051011096','',631,'2022-12-08',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Simvastatin, also known as the brand name product Zocor, is a lipid-lowering drug derived synthetically from a fermentation product of _Aspergillus terreus_.

Apart from its main FDA-approved indications, diltiazem has also been used for numerous off-label indications, such as anal fissures (in topical formulations), migraine prophylaxis, pulmonary hypertension, and rest-related cramps in the lower extremities.[L6289] Typically available in extended-release oral and intravenous formulations, diltiazem is marketed under various brand names with Cardizem and Tiazac being the most common ones.','["C08DB01", "C05AE03"]','[]'),(27098,'Smecta 20% suspension 120 ml','سميكتا 20% معلق 120 مل','11','','Antidiarrheal','Dioctahedral smectite','Amriya > ipsen','Suspension','معلق','20%','1','','mode of action dioctahedral has adsorbent properties and is used in the management of diarrhoea. dioctahedral has unique properties that allow for the adsorption of different toxins (such as rotavirus e. coli and staphylococcus). dioctahedral interacts wi','6221075200636','',968,'2023-04-23',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(27099,'Smecta 20% suspension 60 ml','سميكتا 20% معلق 60 مل','7','','Antidiarrheal','Dioctahedral smectite','Amriya > ipsen','Suspension','معلق','20%','1','','mode of action dioctahedral has adsorbent properties and is used in the management of diarrhoea. dioctahedral has unique properties that allow for the adsorption of different toxins (such as rotavirus e. coli and staphylococcus). dioctahedral interacts wi','6221075200063','',956,'2023-04-23',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(27100,'Smecta 20% suspension 90 ml','سميكتا 20% معلق 90 مل','9','','Antidiarrheal','Dioctahedral smectite','Amriya > ipsen','Suspension','معلق','20%','1','','mode of action dioctahedral has adsorbent properties and is used in the management of diarrhoea. dioctahedral has unique properties that allow for the adsorption of different toxins (such as rotavirus e. coli and staphylococcus). dioctahedral interacts wi','6221075200070','',938,'2023-04-23',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(27101,'Smecta 3gm 10 sachet','سميكتا 3جم 10 اكياس','11','','Antidiarrheal','Dioctahedral smectite','Amriya > ipsen','Sachet','أكياس','3gm','1','','mode of action dioctahedral has adsorbent properties and is used in the management of diarrhoea. dioctahedral has unique properties that allow for the adsorption of different toxins (such as rotavirus e. coli and staphylococcus). dioctahedral interacts wi','6221075180013','',1062,'2023-04-23',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(27102,'Smile baby cream 60 gm','سمايل بيبي كريم 60جم','10','','Diaper rash','Zinc oxide+chamomile+cod liver oil+castor oil','Hi-care > phoenix-egypt','Cream','كريم','60 gm','1','','protection of delicate skin of children and adults (fragrance free steroid free)','','',663,'2022-07-26',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(27103,'Smile lotion 120 ml','سمايل لوشن 120 ملي','10','','Soothing topical','Zinc oxide+menthol+camphor+red iron oxide','H.c.p co. > phoenix-egypt','Lotion','لوشن','120 ml','1','','soothing lotion','6225000027411','',662,'2022-12-08',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(27104,'Smofkabiven peripheral 1904ml=1300kcal emulsion for inf.','سموفكابيفن بريفرال 1300كيلو كالوري مستحلب للتنقيط الوريدي','1,008','593','Sterile solution','Glucose+amino acids+lipids','Fresenius kabi','Unknown','غير محدد','1904ml','1','محلول معقم','','','',9667,'2024-11-23',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(27105,'Smofkabiven peripheral 1206ml=800kcal emulsion for inf.','سموفكابيفين بيرفرال 800 كيلو كالوري مستحلب للتسريب الوريدي','3,320','833','Sterile solution','Glucose+amino acids+lipids','Fresenius kabi','Unknown','غير محدد','1206ml','1','يستخدم كمحلول معقم -- علاج إنخفاض سكر الدم','','','',2827,'2025-03-22',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(27106,'Smoflipid 20% emulsion 100ml i.v. inf.','سموفليبيد 20% مستحلب 100 مل للحقن الوريدي','110','','Sterile solution','Fish oil+olive oil+soya bean oil+triglyceride','Fresenius kabi','Unknown','غير محدد','20%','1','محلول لدعم الصحة -- مصدر للسعرات الحرارية والاحماض الدهنية','','','',1044,'2022-05-28',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(27107,'Smoflipid 20% emulsion 250ml i.v. inf.','سموفيليبيد 20% مستحلب 250 مل محلول وريدي','169','','','Fish oil+olive oil+soya bean oil+triglyceride','Fresenius kabi','Unknown','غير محدد','20%','1','محلول لدعم الصحة -- مصدر للسعرات الحرارية والاحماض الدهنية','','','',2622,'2022-05-28',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(27108,'Smoflipid 20% emulsion 500ml i.v. inf.','سموفليبيد 20% مستحلب 500 مل للحقن الوريدي','362','','Sterile solution','Fish oil+olive oil+soya bean oil+triglyceride','Fresenius kabi','Unknown','غير محدد','20%','1','محلول لدعم الصحة -- مصدر للسعرات الحرارية والاحماض الدهنية','','','',2762,'2022-08-13',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL);

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as sofosbuvir. As a prodrug nucleotide analog, Sofosbuvir is metabolized into its active form as the antiviral agent 2''-deoxy-2''-α-fluoro-β-C-methyluridine-5''-triphosphate (also known as GS-461203), which acts as a defective substrate for NS5B (non-structural protein 5B) [synthesis]. NS5B, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is essential for the transcription of Hepatitis C viral RNA and for its high replicative rate and genetic diversity [A19594]. Sofosbuvir and other direct acting antivirals are therefore very potent options for the treatment of Hepatitis C, as they exhibit a high barrier to the development of resistance [A19593]. This is an important advantage relative to HCV drugs that target other viral enzymes such as the protease, for which rapid development of resistance has proven to be an important cause of therapeutic failure.  

In a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend Sofosbuvir as first line therapy in combination with other antivirals for all six genotypes of Hepatitis C [L852]. Depending on the genotype, sofosbuvir is often used in combination with other antivirals such as [DB09027], [DB11613], [DB09102], [DB06290], [DB11574], [DB11575], [DB00811], [DB00008], or [DB00022] with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626]. Treatment with direct acting antivirals such as sofosbuvir is associated with very minimal side effects, with the most common being headache and fatigue [FDA Label]. Lack of significant side effects and short duration of therapy is a considerable advantage over older interferon- and ribavirin-based regimens, which were limited by infusion site reactions, reduced blood count, and neuropsychiatric effects [A19635]. 

Since 2014, sofosbuvir has been available as a fixed dose combination product with [DB09027] (tradename Harvoni) used for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C. Approved in October 2014 by the FDA, Harvoni is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1, 4, 5, and 6 with or without [DB00811] depending on the level of liver damage or cirrhosis [FDA Label].  When combined together, ledipasvir and sofosbuvir as the combination product Harvoni has been shown to achieve a SVR between 93 and 99% after 12 weeks of treatment [A7535]. Its use has also proven successful in the treatment of HCV in patients co-infected with HIV [A19627].

Sofosbuvir is also available as a fixed dose combination product with [DB11613] as the commercially available product Epclusa. First approved in June 2016, Epclusa is the first combination HCV product indicated for the treatment of all genotypes of Hepatitis C with or without cirrhosis. Epclusa is also currently the most potent HCV antiviral medication on the market with a sustained virologic response (SVR) after 12 weeks of therapy of 93-99% depending on genotype and level of cirrhosis [L852]. Both Canadian and American guidelines list Epclusa as a first line recommendation for all genotypes of HCV [L852, A19626].

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as sofosbuvir. As a prodrug nucleotide analog, Sofosbuvir is metabolized into its active form as the antiviral agent 2''-deoxy-2''-α-fluoro-β-C-methyluridine-5''-triphosphate (also known as GS-461203), which acts as a defective substrate for NS5B (non-structural protein 5B) [synthesis]. NS5B, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is essential for the transcription of Hepatitis C viral RNA and for its high replicative rate and genetic diversity [A19594]. Sofosbuvir and other direct acting antivirals are therefore very potent options for the treatment of Hepatitis C, as they exhibit a high barrier to the development of resistance [A19593]. This is an important advantage relative to HCV drugs that target other viral enzymes such as the protease, for which rapid development of resistance has proven to be an important cause of therapeutic failure.  

In a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend Sofosbuvir as first line therapy in combination with other antivirals for all six genotypes of Hepatitis C [L852]. Depending on the genotype, sofosbuvir is often used in combination with other antivirals such as [DB09027], [DB11613], [DB09102], [DB06290], [DB11574], [DB11575], [DB00811], [DB00008], or [DB00022] with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626]. Treatment with direct acting antivirals such as sofosbuvir is associated with very minimal side effects, with the most common being headache and fatigue [FDA Label]. Lack of significant side effects and short duration of therapy is a considerable advantage over older interferon- and ribavirin-based regimens, which were limited by infusion site reactions, reduced blood count, and neuropsychiatric effects [A19635]. 

Since 2014, sofosbuvir has been available as a fixed dose combination product with [DB09027] (tradename Harvoni) used for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C. Approved in October 2014 by the FDA, Harvoni is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1, 4, 5, and 6 with or without [DB00811] depending on the level of liver damage or cirrhosis [FDA Label].  When combined together, ledipasvir and sofosbuvir as the combination product Harvoni has been shown to achieve a SVR between 93 and 99% after 12 weeks of treatment [A7535]. Its use has also proven successful in the treatment of HCV in patients co-infected with HIV [A19627].

Sofosbuvir is also available as a fixed dose combination product with [DB11613] as the commercially available product Epclusa. First approved in June 2016, Epclusa is the first combination HCV product indicated for the treatment of all genotypes of Hepatitis C with or without cirrhosis. Epclusa is also currently the most potent HCV antiviral medication on the market with a sustained virologic response (SVR) after 12 weeks of therapy of 93-99% depending on genotype and level of cirrhosis [L852].

ARBs selectively bind to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) and prevent the protein angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects, which include vasoconstriction, stimulation and synthesis of aldosterone and ADH, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, among others. Overall, valsartan''s physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium. 

Valsartan also affects the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays an important role in hemostasis and regulation of kidney, vascular, and cardiac functions. Pharmacological blockade of RAAS via  AT1 receptor blockade inhibits negative regulatory feedback within RAAS, which is a contributing factor to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal disease. In particular, heart failure is associated with chronic activation of RAAS, leading to inappropriate fluid retention, vasoconstriction, and ultimately a further decline in left ventricular function. ARBs have been shown to have a protective effect on the heart by improving cardiac function, reducing afterload, increasing cardiac output and preventing ventricular hypertrophy and remodelling.[A174154] 

By comparison, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) class of medications (which includes drugs such as [ramipril], [lisinopril], and [perindopril]) inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II through inhibition of the ACE enzyme. However, this does not prevent the formation of all angiotensin II within the body. The angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs unique in that it blocks all angiotensin II activity, regardless of where or how it was synthesized. 

Valsartan is commonly used for the management of hypertension, heart failure, and Type 2 Diabetes-associated nephropathy, particularly in patients who are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors. ARBs such as valsartan have been shown in a number of large-scale clinical outcomes trials to improve cardiovascular outcomes including reducing risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, the progression of heart failure, and hospitalization.[A174124,A178153,A173869,A185324,A185327,A185333,A185342,A185345] Valsartan also slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy due to its renoprotective effects.[A174157,A174160,A174163] Improvements in chronic kidney disease with valsartan include both clinically and statistically significant decreases in urinary albumin and protein excretion in patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and in nondiabetic patients diagnosed with chronic kidney disease.[A174124,A173869]

Valsartan was initially approved in 1996 in Europe for the treatment of hypertension in adults.

Shortly after, in 1997, this drug was approved in the United States.[A174124] Valsartan is generally well-tolerated with a side-effect profile superior to that of other antihypertensive drugs.[A174130,A174133]','["C09DX05", "C10BX10", "C09DA03", "C09CA03", "C09DX02", "C09DX01", "C09DB08", "C09DB01", "C09DX04"]','[]'),(27311,'Sorti 20 tabs.','سورتي 20 قرص','59','49','Multiviamins','Iron+folic acid+vitamin b12+zinc+copper+vitamin c','Nutrixia > linkopharm','Tab','أقراص','','2','حديد وحمض فوليك وفيتامين ب12','dose: once daily.','6224008585664','',3546,'2024-03-17',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(27312,'Sotaloc 160mg tabs.','سوتالوك 160مجم أقراص','10','','Antiarrhythmias.class iii','Sotalol','Alfacure pharmaceuticals','Tab','أقراص','160mg','1','','about sotalol beta (nonselective) adneregic blocking agent a potassium channel blocker anti-hypertensive class iii anti-arrhythmic. mechanism of action of sotalol sotalol is a non selective beta receptor antagonist. it has negative chronotropic effect on','','',1393,'2022-07-09',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Sotalol is a methanesulfonanilide developed in 1960.[A178579] It was the first of the class III anti arrhythmic drugs.[A178579] Sotalol was first approved as an oral tablet on 30 October 1992.[L6334] A racemic mixture of sotalol is currently formulated as a tablet, oral solution, and intravenous injection indicated for life threatening ventricular arrhythmias and maintaining normal sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation or flutter.[Label,L6373,L6376]','["C07AA07", "C07BA07", "C07FX02"]','[]'),(27313,'Souvana topical lotion 120 ml','سوفانا لوشن 120 مل','60','50','Soothing topical','Zinc oxide+menthol crystals+thymol+chamomile+dimethicone+glycerol','Hi-care > api pharma','Lotion','لوشن','120 ml','1','مرطب للجلد.','skin soothing lotion','','',1974,'2024-08-13',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(27314,'Aaa','ششش','4,840','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',717,'2022-07-18',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(27315,'Sovelpak 400/100mg 28 tablets','سوفيلباك 400/100مجم 28 قرص','1,270','','Antiviral','Sofosbuvir+velpatasvir','Marcyrl','Tablet','أقراص','100mg','4','مضاد فيروسات','','','',5515,'2022-04-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(27316,'Soy lecithin 1200 mg 100 softgels (illegal import)','سوي ليسيثين 1200مجم 100 سوفت جل','0','','','Soy lecithin','Puritans pride','Gel','جل','1200 mg','1','','lecithin is an important natural source of choline and inositol two nutrients important for the proper functioning of the body.** since levels of phospholipids in the brain can decline as you get older it may be especially important to supplement with a h','','',562,'2022-07-29',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(27317,'Spaniela mr 35mg 30 f.c. tab.','سبانيلا ام ار 35مجم 30 قرص','54','39','Anti-ischemic','Trimetazidine','Marcyrl co.','Tab','أقراص','35mg','3','علاج قصور الدورة الدموية — تنشيط الدورة الدموية للمخ — علاج مساعد في حالات الذبحة الصدرية','about trimetazidine cytoprotective vasodilator anti-ischemic (anti-anginal) agent. mechanism of action of trimetazidine it is a cytoprotective drug which reduces anginal attacks and improves exercise tolerance by nonhaemodynamic mechanisms. it improves ce','6223003579418','',10537,'2025-05-27',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'C01EB15',NULL),(27318,'Spanomep syrup 120 ml','سبانوميب شراب 120 مل','25','16.5','Anti-cough.antitussive and expectorant','Ivy leaves','Mepaco','Syrup','شراب','120 ml','1','مكمل غذائى مضاد للسعال ومذيب للبلغم يدعم الجهاز التنفسي ويخفف من اعراض البرد','due to their broncholytic and secretolic properties ivy leaf dried extract has long provided its worth in practice. their efficacy has been demonstrated in numerous scientific studies. according to a pharmacological investigation its constituent appears t','','',2211,'2023-09-09',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(27319,'Aaa','ششش','35','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',592,'2023-01-12',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(27320,'Sparatec 200mg 12 tab.','سباراتيك 200مجم 12قرص','36','','Antibiotic.quinolone','Sparfloxacin','Unipharma co.','Tab','أقراص','200mg','2','','about sparfloxacin a third generation fluoroquinolone a synthetic broad-spectrum antibiotic. mechanism of action of sparfloxacin sparfloxacin is a bacteriostatic at low concentration and bactericidal at high concentration. it acts by inhibiting the enzyme','','',588,'2023-01-14',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Sparfloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic indicated for bacterial infections.

More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Rosuvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [simvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] This is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than [atorvastatin]''s effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial[A181427] concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.

Rosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]','["C10BX10", "C10BX05", "C10BX07", "C10AA07", "A10BH52", "G01AE10", "C10BX13", "C10BX09", "C10BA09", "C10BX16", "C10BX17", "C10BX14", "C10BA06"]','[]');

The result of doing so allows cGMP present in both the penis and pulmonary vasculature to elicit smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation that subsequently facilitates relief in pulmonary arterial hypertension and the increased flow of blood into the spongy erectile tissue of the penis that consequently allows it to grow in size and become erect and rigid [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

Interestingly enough, it is precisely via this mechanism why sildenafil was at first researched as a potential treatment for angina - or chest pain associated with inadequate blood flow to the heart - before being serendipitously indicated for treating erectile dysfunction in the late 1980s [A175732]. Nevertheless, it is because of this mechanism that sildenafil is also indicated for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension but is also additionally notorious for interacting with various anti-anginal or anti-hypertensive agents to develop potentially rapid, excessive, and/or fatal hypotensive crises [A175579, A175582, A175654].

Regardless, sildenafil, among a variety of other similar or related PDE5 inhibitors, has become a common and effective treatment for erectile dysfunction and since its formal approval for medical use in the public in 1998 [A175732], continues to see millions of prescriptions written for it internationally. Although the medication has historically been most popularly recognized as Pfizer''s brand name Viagra, sildenafil is currently available generically and even as a non-prescription over the counter medication in some countries [L5656].','["G01AE10", "G04BE03"]','[]'),(27526,'Stivarga 40mg 3*28 f.c. tabs.','ستيفارجا 40مجم 3*28 اقراص','26,645','17697','Anti-angiogenic','Regorafenib','Bayer healthcare','Tab','أقراص','40mg','3','','regorafenib is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor developed by bayer which targets angiogenic stromal and oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase (rtk). regorafenib shows anti-angiogenic activity due to its dual targeted vegfr2-tie2 tyrosine kinase inhibition. ind','','',3377,'2025-06-21',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Regorafenib is an orally-administered inhibitor of multiple kinases.

It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infections along with other antibiotics including [DB01060], [DB01211], and [DB00916], for example.[A177271, F4498] Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [DB00338], [DB00213], [DB00448], [DB05351], and [DB01129]. Esomeprazole is the s-isomer of [DB00338], which is a racemate of the S- and R-enantiomer. Esomeprazole has been shown to inhibit acid secretion to a similar extent as [DB00338], without any significant differences between the two compounds _in vitro_. 

Esomeprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of esomeprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, esomeprazole''s duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]

PPIs such as esomeprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as esomeprazole has been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients such as iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]

Although the underlying pathophysiology that causes ADHD remains unclear, evidence suggests that dysregulation in noradrenergic and dopaminergic pathways plays a critical role in suboptimal executive functioning within prefrontal regions of the brain, which are involved in attention and memory.[A178090] Atomoxetine has been shown to specifically increase NA and DA within the prefrontal cortex, but not in the nucleus accumbens (NA) or striatum.[A18262] This is beneficial in the treatment of ADHD as DA activation in the subcortical NA and striatum is associated with many stimulant-associated side effects and an increase in abuse potential, which is a limiting factor associated with the use of stimulant medications such as [DB00422], [DB01576], and [DB01255].[A18262] Use of non-stimulant medications such as atomoxetine is therefore thought to offer a clinical advantage over the use of traditional medications for the management of ADHD.

Many contain a blackbox warning stating that CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate-containing products and amphetamines, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. In particular, increased dopamine in key areas caused by these stimulant medications is associated with their reinforcing and addictive properties, and even amplifies the potency and reinforcing effects of other drugs of abuse such as amphetamines, making ADHD sufferers more susceptible to their addictive effects.[A177556] Concerns about abuse potential have spurred research into medications with fewer effects on DA and the use of non-stimulant ADHD medications including atomoxetine, [DB00745] and [DB01018].

disease (GERD), for gastric protection to prevent recurrence of stomach ulcers or gastric damage from chronic use of NSAIDs, and for the treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions including Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) Syndrome. It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infections along with other antibiotics including [amoxicillin], [clarithromycin], and [metronidazole], for example.[A177271][F4498] Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [omeprazole], [esomeprazole], [lansoprazole], [dexlansoprazole], and [rabeprazole].

Pantoprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cell. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of pantoprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, pantoprazole''s duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as pantoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]

PPIs such as pantoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]

Pantoprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing as rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as pantoprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion.[A177574]','["A02BD04", "A02BD11", "A02BC02"]','[]'),(27578,'Stripsore 24 lozenges','ستربسور 24 قطعة','40','','Sore throat','Dichlorophenylcarbinol+amylmetacresol','Luna for perfumes and cosmetics > andalous pharma','Lozenges','استحلاب','','3','علاج وتخفيف التهاب واحتقان الحلق والحنجرة','soothing effective relief for sore throats available in many tastes','6224000396114','',2000,'2022-12-09',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'P02DX02',NULL),(27580,'Stroka 75mg 30 f.c. tab','ستروكا 75مجم 30 قرص','145','','Antiplatelet.adp receptor blocker','Clopidogrel','Multi-apex','Tab','أقراص','75mg','3','مضاد للتجلط -- الحفاظ علي صحة القلب -- علاج الجلطات التي تتكون في الجسم -- الحفاظ علي سيولة الدورة الدموية','','6223003200398','',2117,'2022-12-09',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Clopidogrel is a prodrug of a platelet inhibitor used to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke.[A180508,L7213] Clopidogrel is indicated to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction for patients with non-ST elevated acute coronary syndrome (ACS), patients with ST-elevated myocardial infarction, and in recent MI, stroke, or established peripheral arterial disease,[L7213]
