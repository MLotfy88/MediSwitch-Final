Postganglionic adrenergic blocking agents such as guanadrel, guanethidine, and rauwolfia alkaloids work by depleting catecholamine stores from adrenergic nerve endings.  Therefore, they may sensitize adrenergic receptors to direct-acting sympathomimetics, but blunt the effects of indirect-acting agents whose activity is mediated through the release of catecholamines.  Guanethidine and reserpine have been reported to attenuate the pharmacologic effects (mydriasis, pressor response) induced by ephedrine and dopamine, both of which exhibit direct and indirect sympathomimetic activities (i.e., mixed-acting).  However, guanethidine intensified the mydriasis produced by phenylephrine, which is also thought to be mixed-acting.
