Somatic ACE has two functionally active domains, N and C, which arise from tandem gene duplication. Although the two domains have high sequence similarity, they play distinct physiological roles. The C-domain is predominantly involved in blood pressure regulation while the N-domain plays a role in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and proliferation. ACE inhibitors bind to and inhibit the activity of both domains, but have much greater affinity for and inhibitory activity against the C-domain. Perindoprilat, the active metabolite of perindopril, competes with ATI for binding to ACE and inhibits and enzymatic proteolysis of ATI to ATII. Decreasing ATII levels in the body decreases blood pressure by inhibiting the pressor effects of ATII as described in the Pharmacology section above. Perindopril also causes an increase in plasma renin activity likely due to a loss of feedback inhibition mediated by ATII on the release of renin and/or stimulation of reflex mechanisms via baroreceptors. ', 'Perindopril is a nonsulfhydryl prodrug that is metabolized via first pass effect (62%) and systemic hydrolysis (38%) to perindoprilat, its active metabolite, following oral administration. Perindoprilat lowers blood pressure by antagonizing the effect of the RAAS. The RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from the granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. In the blood stream, renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to ATI, which is subsequently cleaved to ATII by ACE. ATII increases blood pressure using a number of mechanisms. First, it stimulates the secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone travels to the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and collecting tubule of nephrons where it increases sodium and water reabsorption by increasing the number of sodium channels and sodium-potassium ATPases on cell membranes. Second, ATII stimulates the secretion of vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone or ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland. ADH stimulates further water reabsorption from the kidneys via insertion of aquaporin-2 channels on the apical surface of cells of the DCT and collecting tubules. Third, ATII increases blood pressure through direct arterial vasoconstriction. Stimulation of the Type 1 ATII receptor on vascular smooth muscle cells leads to a cascade of events resulting in myocyte contraction and vasoconstriction. In addition to these major effects, ATII induces the thirst response via stimulation of hypothalamic neurons. ACE inhibitors inhibit the rapid conversion of ATI to ATII and antagonize RAAS-induced increases in blood pressure. ACE (also known as kininase II) is also involved in the enzymatic deactivation of bradykinin, a vasodilator. Inhibiting the deactivation of bradykinin increases bradykinin levels and may sustain the effects of perindoprilat by causing increased vasodilation and decreased blood pressure.', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

**Metformin extended-release tablet (XR)**



The extended-release formulation of metformin is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Safety in children has not been determined to this date.[L12207]



**Metformin combination products**



Metformin is a component of a variety of combination products with other anti-diabetic agents. It is indicated, along with diet and exercise, to improve glycemic control in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in combination with DPP-4 inhibitors ([sitagliptin], [linagliptin], [alogliptin], or [saxagliptin]),[L11479,L40248,L40253,L40258,L40263] in combination with SGLT2 inhibitors ([canagliflozin], [empagliflozin], [ertugliflozin], or [dapagliflozin]),[L11479,L30503,L1134,L13679,L38729] or in combination with [pioglitazone].[L11419]', 'Metformin''s mechanisms of action are unique from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic drugs. Metformin decreases blood glucose levels by decreasing hepatic glucose production (also called gluconeogenesis), decreasing the intestinal absorption of glucose, and increasing insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.[L12207] It is well established that metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I activity, and it has since been generally postulated that its potent antidiabetic effects occur through this mechanism.[A36534, A36557]   The above processes lead to a decrease in blood glucose, managing type II diabetes and exerting positive effects on glycemic control.



After ingestion, the organic cation transporter-1 (OCT1) is responsible for the uptake of metformin into hepatocytes (liver cells). As this drug is positively charged, it accumulates in cells and in the mitochondria because of the membrane potentials across the plasma membrane as well as the mitochondrial inner membrane. Metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I, preventing the production of mitochondrial ATP leading to increased cytoplasmic ADP:ATP and AMP:ATP ratios.[A36534] These changes activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an enzyme that plays an important role in the regulation of glucose metabolism.[A176348] Aside from this mechanism, AMPK can be activated by a lysosomal mechanism involving other activators.  Following this process, increases in AMP:ATP ratio also inhibit _fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase_ enzyme, resulting in the inhibition of gluconeogenesis, while also inhibiting _adenylate cyclase_ and decreasing the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP),[A36534] a derivative of ATP used for cell signaling [A176351]. Activated AMPK phosphorylates two isoforms of acetyl-CoA carboxylase enzyme, thereby inhibiting fat synthesis and leading to fat oxidation, reducing hepatic lipid stores and increasing liver sensitivity to insulin.[A36534] 



In the intestines, metformin increases anaerobic glucose metabolism in enterocytes (intestinal cells), leading to reduced net glucose uptake and increased delivery of lactate to the liver. Recent studies have also implicated the gut as a primary site of action of metformin and suggest that the liver may not be as important for metformin action in patients with type 2 diabetes. Some of the ways metformin may play a role on the intestines is by promoting the metabolism of glucose by increasing glucagon-like peptide I (GLP-1) as well as increasing gut utilization of glucose.[A36534] 



In addition to the above pathway, the mechanism of action of metformin may be explained by other ways, and its exact mechanism of action has been under extensive study in recent years.[A36535, A36554, A36555, A36557]', '**General effects**



Insulin is an important hormone that regulates blood glucose levels.[T514] Type II diabetes is characterized by a decrease in sensitivity to insulin, resulting in elevations in blood glucose when the pancreas can no longer compensate. In patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, insulin is unable to exert adequate effects on tissues and cells (i.e. insulin resistance)[T514] and insulin deficiency may also be present.[L5753]



Metformin reduces hepatic production of glucose, decreases the intestinal absorption of glucose, and enhances insulin sensitivity by increasing both peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. In contrast with drugs of the sulfonylurea class, which lead to hyperinsulinemia, the secretion of insulin is unchanged with metformin use.[L12207]



**Effect on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c)**



HbA1c is an important periodic measure of glycemic control used to monitor diabetic patients. Fasting plasma glucose is also a useful and important measure of glycemic control. In a 29-week clinical trial of subjects diagnosed with type II diabetes, metformin decreased the fasting plasma glucose levels by an average of 59 mg/dL from baseline, compared to an average increase of 6.3 mg/dL from baseline in subjects taking a placebo.[L12207]  Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was decreased by about 1.4% in subjects receiving metformin, and increased by 0.4% in subjects receiving placebo only.[L12207]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Concurrently, as one of the most commonly utilized forms of vitamin D, cholecalciferol is also very frequently used as a supplement in individuals to maintain sufficient vitamin d levels in the body or to treat vitamin D deficiency, as well as various medical conditions that can be associated directly or indirectly with vitamin d insufficiency like osteoporosis and chronic kidney disease, among others [A176041, A176044, F4051].', 'Most individuals naturally generate adequate amounts of vitamin D through ordinary dietary intake of vitamin D (in some foods like eggs, fish, and cheese) and natural photochemical conversion of the vitamin D3 precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin via exposure to sunlight [L5689, F4027, F4042, F4048].



Conversely, vitamin D deficiency can often occur from a combination of insufficient exposure to sunlight, inadequate dietary intake of vitamin D, genetic defects with endogenous vitamin D receptor, or even severe liver or kidney disease [A243]. Such deficiency is known for resulting in conditions like rickets or osteomalacia, all of which reflect inadequate mineralization of bone, enhanced compensatory skeletal demineralization, resultant decreased calcium ion blood concentrations, and increases in the production and secretion of parathyroid hormone [A223]. Increases in parathyroid hormone stimulate the mobilization of skeletal calcium and the renal excretion of phosphorus [A223]. This enhanced mobilization of skeletal calcium leads towards porotic bone conditions [A223].



Ordinarily, while vitamin D3 is made naturally via photochemical processes in the skin, both itself and vitamin D2 can be found in various food and pharmaceutical sources as dietary supplements. The principal biological function of vitamin D is the maintenance of normal levels of serum calcium and phosphorus in the bloodstream by enhancing the efficacy of the small intestine to absorb these minerals from the diet [A223]. At the liver, vitamin D3 or D2 is hydroxylated to 25-hydroxyvitamin D and then finally to the primary active metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in the kidney via further hydroxylation [A223, A243]. This final metabolite binds to endogenous vitamin d receptors, which results in a variety of regulatory roles - including maintaining  calcium balance, the regulation of parathyroid hormone, the promotion of the renal reabsorption of calcium, increased intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus, and increased calcium and phosphorus mobilization of calcium and phosphorus from bone to plasma to maintain balanced levels of each in bone and the plasma [A223, A243].



In particular, calcitriol interacts with vitamin D receptors in the small intestine to enhance the efficiency of intestinal calcium and phosphorous absorption from about 10-15% to 30-40% and 60% increased to 80%, respectively [L5689]. Furthermore, calcitriol binds with vitamin D receptors in osteoblasts to stimulate a receptor activator of nuclear factor kB ligand (or RANKL) which subsequently interacts with receptor activator of nuclear factor kB (NFkB) on immature preosteoclasts, causing them to become mature bone-resorbing osteoclasts [L5689]. Such mature osteoclasts ultimately function in removing calcium and phosphorus from bone to maintain blood calcium and phosphorus levels [L5689]. Moreover, calcitriol also stimulates calcium reabsorption from the glomerular filtrate in the kidneys [L5689].



Additionally, it is believed that when calcitriol binds with nuclear vitamin D receptors, that this bound complex itself binds to retinoic acid X receptor (RXR) to generate a heterodimeric complex that consequently binds to specific nucleotide sequences in the DNA called vitamin D response elements [L5689]. When bound, various transcription factors attach to this complex, resulting in either up or down-regulation of the associated gene''s activity. It is thought that there may be as much as 200 to 2000 genes that possess vitamin D response elements or that are influenced indirectly to control a multitude of genes across the genome [L5689].  It is in this way that cholecalciferol is believed to function in regulating gene transcription associated with cancer risk, autoimmune disorders, and cardiovascular disease linked to vitamin D deficiency [L5689]. In fact, there has been some research to suggest calcitriol may also be able to prevent malignancies by inducing cellular maturation and inducing apoptosis and inhibiting angiogenesis, exhibit anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting foam cell formation and promoting angiogenesis in endothelial colony-forming cells in vitro, inhibit immune reactions by enhancing the transcription of endogenous antibiotics like cathelicidin and regulate the activity and differentiation of CD4+ T cells, amongst a variety of other proposed actions [L5689].   ', 'The in vivo synthesis of the predominant two biologically active metabolites of vitamin D occurs in two steps. The first hydroxylation of vitamin D3 cholecalciferol (or D2) occurs in the liver to yield 25-hydroxyvitamin D while the second hydroxylation happens in the kidneys to give 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D [F4027, F4042, F4048]. These vitamin D metabolites subsequently facilitate the active absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the small intestine, serving to increase serum calcium and phosphate levels sufficiently to allow bone mineralization [F4027, F4042, F4048]. Conversely, these vitamin D metabolites also assist in mobilizing calcium and phosphate from bone and likely increase the reabsorption of calcium and perhaps also of phosphate via the renal tubules [F4027, F4042, F4048]. There exists a period of 10 to 24 hours between the administration of cholecalciferol and the initiation of its action in the body due to the necessity of synthesis of the active vitamin D metabolites in the liver and kidneys [F4027, F4042, F4048]. It is parathyroid hormone that is responsible for the regulation of such metabolism at the level of the kidneys [F4027, F4042, F4048].', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

By doing so, it inhibits acid secretion into the gsatric lumen. This effect is dose-related and leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus.



Esomeprazole is the s-isomer of [DB00338], which is a racemate of the S- and R-enantiomer. Esomeprazole has been shown to inhibit acid secretion to a similar extent as [DB00338], without any significant differences between the two compounds _in vitro_. 



PPIs such as esomeprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]



Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as esomeprazole has been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Taking iron in supplement form, such as ferrous sulfate, allows for more rapid increases in iron levels when dietary supply and stores are not sufficient.[L2175] Iron is transported by the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) across the endolysosomal membrane to enter the macrophage. It can then can be incorporated into ferritin and be stored in the macrophage or carried of the macrophage by ferroportin.

Due to atomoxetine''s noradrenergic activity, it also has effects on the cardiovascular system such as increased blood pressure and tachycardia.[T244] Sudden deaths, stroke, and myocardial infarction have been reported in patients taking atomoxetine at usual doses for ADHD. Atomoxetine should be used with caution in patients whose underlying medical conditions could be worsened by increases in blood pressure or heart rate such as certain patients with hypertension, tachycardia, or cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. It should not be used in patients with severe cardiac or vascular disorders whose condition would be expected to deteriorate if they experienced clinically important increases in blood pressure or heart rate. Although the role of atomoxetine in these cases is unknown, consideration should be given to not treating patients with clinically significant cardiac abnormalities. Patients who develop symptoms such as exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or other symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease during atomoxetine treatment should undergo a prompt cardiac evaluation.[F4639]



In general, particular care should be taken in treating ADHD in patients with comorbid bipolar disorder because of concern for possible induction of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder.

Hyaluronic acid works by two basic mechanisms: serving as a passive structural molecule or serving as signaling molecule, depending on the molecule size. The physicochemical properties of high molecular weight HA contribute to passive structural effects, demonstrating hygroscopicity and viscoelasticity and improving hydration, water balance, and structural integrity. As a signalling  molecule interacting with proteins, HA causes several opposing effects based on molecular weight: pro- or anti-inflammatory effects, promotion or inhibition of cell migration, and activating or inhibiting cell division.[A230133] 



Hyaluronic acid exerts its therapeutic effects through binding to three primary types of cell surface receptors: CD44 (a membrane glycoprotein), the receptor for hyaluronate-mediated motility (RHAMM), and the Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1). CD44 is considered the most widely distributed receptor for hyaluronic acid, demonstrating cellular interactions with osteopontin, collagen, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).  High and low molecular weight hyaluronic acids demonstrate differing molecular and cellular mechanisms in their interaction with CD44 receptors. Some examples of these effects include modification of chondrocyte survival pathways in addition to alteration of apoptosis pathways.  Lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor (LYVE-1), and hyaluronic acid receptor for endocytosis (HARE), (also known as Stabilin-2) also bind to hyaluronic acid.[A230128] 



Hyaluronic acid for skin conditions and cosmetics



Hyaluronic acid''s anionic proprieties cause it to attract water and induce swelling, increasing tissue volume and skin structural integrity. The aging process is associated with reduced production of skin hyaluronic acid and collagen, causing the appearance of wrinkles and the loss of facial volume. Dermal fillers of hyaluronic acid replace lost tissue volume, imparting a full and youthful appearance to skin that has lost its elasticity. Hyaluronic acid fillers contain cross-linked hyaluronic acid particles, rendering a concentrated substance with resistance to various forms of physical and chemical breakdown. The cosmetic benefits of hyaluronic acid filler may last up to 6 months, depending on the brand and technique used for injection.[L32193] Additionally, dermal hyaluronic acid fillers are known to increase the production of fibroblasts[L32193], supporting wound healing and offering relief from irritating and inflammatory skin conditions.[A230118]





Hyaluronic acid for joint pain



Most cells in the human body are capable of synthesizing HA. It is a primary component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and can be found in bone marrow, cartilage, and synovial fluid in joints.[A230128] In osteoarthritis, the concentration of naturally occurring hyaluronic acid gradually decreases, lowering the viscosity of synovial fluid that protects joints from excess friction.

Hyaluronic acid for ophthalmic conditions and ophthalmological procedures



Solutions of hyaluronic acid with a concentration greater than 0.1% moisturize the surface of the eyes to treat symptoms of dry eye while improving the stabilization of tear film, replenishing deficiencies of HA, reducing friction, and preventing binding of foreign substances to the ocular tissue.[A230128,L32193] Hyaluronic acid is frequently used during and after ophthalmological surgeries and plays important roles by virtue of its moisturizing, viscoelastic, and protective properties. It promotes tissue healing of the corneal epithelium and other parts of the eye following ophthalmological surgery, minimizing the risk of adhesions and free radical formation.[A230128]

', 'HA has long-acting lubricant, shock absorbing, joint stabilizing, and water balancing properties.[A230128,L32193] It is similar to the naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan (GAG) in joints. Hyaluronic acid works by acting as a lubricant and shock absorber, facilitating joint mobility and thereby reducing osteoarthritic pain.  Hyaluronic acid has antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic effects.[A230128] The water-balancing properties and viscoelasticity of hyaluronic acid are beneficial in cosmetic injections, imparting volume and reducing the appearance of imperfections and wrinkles.[L32193] Due to the abovementioned properties, HA has a protective effect on the eyes and cornea.[A230133]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Therapeutic efforts directed toward the control of hyperphosphatemia include reduction in the dietary intake of phosphate, inhibition of absorption of phosphate in the intestine with phosphate binders, and removal of phosphate from the body by more efficient methods of dialysis. The rate of removal of phosphate by dietary manipulation or by dialysis is insufficient. Dialysis patients absorb 40% to 80% of dietary phosphorus. Therefore, the fraction of dietary phosphate absorbed from the diet needs to be reduced by using phosphate binders in most renal failure patients on maintenance dialysis.

ARBs selectively bind to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) and prevent the protein angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects. As the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, Angiotensin II causes vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis.[F4709] Overall, olmesartan''s physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium. 



Olmesartan also effects on the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an important role in hemostasis and regulation of kidney, vascular, and cardiac functions. Pharmacological blockade of RAAS via  AT1 receptor blockade inhibits negative regulatory feedback within RAAS, which is a contributing factor to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal disease. In particular, heart failure is associated with chronic activation of RAAS, leading to inappropriate fluid retention, vasoconstriction, and ultimately a further decline in left ventricular function. ARBs have been shown to have a protective effect on the heart by improving cardiac function, reducing afterload, increasing cardiac output and preventing ventricular hypertrophy and remodelling.[A174154] ', 'Overall, olmesartan''s physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium. 





**Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients**



In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, such as volume-and/or salt-depleted patients (e.g., those being treated with high doses of diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may be anticipated after initiation of treatment with olmesartan. Initiate treatment under close medical supervision. If hypotension does occur, place the patient in the supine position and, if necessary, give an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized.[F4709,F4712]



Valvular Stenosis: there is concern on theoretical grounds that patients with aortic stenosis might be at a particular risk of decreased coronary perfusion, because they do not develop as much afterload reduction.[F4712]





**Impaired Renal Function**



As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with olmesartan. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and rarely with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with olmesartan.



In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) have been reported. There has been no long-term use of olmesartan medoxomil in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but similar results may be expected.[F4709,F4712]





**Sprue-like Enteropathy**



Severe, chronic diarrhea with substantial weight loss has been reported in patients taking olmesartan months to years after drug initiation. Intestinal biopsies of patients often demonstrated villous atrophy. If a patient develops these symptoms during treatment with olmesartan, exclude other etiologies. Consider discontinuation of olmesartan medoxomil in cases where no other etiology is identified.[F4709,F4712]

', 'Nicorandil mediates its therapeutic efficacy via two main mechanisms. Nicorandil is an activator and opener of ATP-sensitive (ATP-dependent) potassium channels (KATP channels) that are composed of Kir6.x-type subunits and sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) subunits. Nicorandil binding sites are located in the sulfonylurea receptor 2 (SUR2) in the ATP-sensitive potassium channel [A20322], which are regulatory subunits of the channel that exhibit an ATPase activitiy [A12436]. There are 2 types of SUR2 subunits (2A/2B) that have identical nucleotide binding domains (NBD), where SUR2A is more predominantly expressed in skeletal and cardiac myocytes and SUR2B in smooth muscle cells [A12436]. Nicorandil more potently activates SUR2B/Kir6.2 than SUR2A/Kir6.2 channels to cause hyperpolarization. ATP-NBD1 interaction influences the channel signalling by nicorandil, and the response of the channel to nicorandil is also facilitated and heightened by the interaction of ATP or ADP with NBD2 [A20321]. Potentiated activity of ATP-sensitive channels have cardioprotective role by limiting the duration of action potentials and preventing intraceullar calcium overload [A20326]. This attenuates cellular injury by preserving cellular energetics and ultimately cell survival [A20324]. KATP channel-dependent membrane hyperpolarization can also lead to vasodilation via reduction in Ca2+ influx through the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and regulation of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in smooth muscle cells [A20324]. 

Nicorandil contain a nitrate moiety in its structure, making it a good dilator of vascular smooth muscle like other nitroglycerin esters [A20323]. Direct relaxation of venous vascular system arises from NO-donor mediated stimulation of guanylyl cyclase and increased levels of intracellular cyclic GMP (cGMP). Elevated levels of cGMP contributes to the total relaxing effect of nicorandil at higher concentrations of the drug [A7839]. ', 'Nicorandil is a potassium channel opener with nitrovasodilator (NO donor) actions, making it both an arterial and a venous dilator [T28]. It causes sustained dilation of both the arterial resistance and conductive vessels that increases coronary blood flow, however the effect of the drug on coronary arteries does not involve the coronary steal phenomenon [L887]. Activation of potassium channels lead to hyperpolarization of the smooth muscle cells, followed by arterial dilation and afterload reduction. Nicorandil is shown to increase pooling in the capacitance vessels with a decrease in preload through relaxing the venous vascular system. Overall, improved blood flow and reduced infarct size are achieved through reduction of end-diastolix pressure and decreased extravascular component of vascular resistance [L887].

**Pathological hypersecretory conditions including Zollinger-Ellison syndrome**



Indicated for the long-term treatment of the above conditions.[F3202]', 'Hydrochloric acid (HCl) secretion into the gastric lumen is a process regulated mainly by the H(+)/K(+)-ATPase of the proton pump, expressed in high quantities by the parietal cells of the stomach.[A174295] ATPase is an enzyme on the parietal cell membrane that facilitates hydrogen and potassium exchange through the cell, which normally results in the extrusion of potassium and formation of HCl (gastric acid). 



Proton pump inhibitors such as pantoprazole are substituted _benzimidazole_ derivatives, weak bases, which accumulate in the acidic space of the parietal cell before being converted in the _canaliculi_  (small canal) of the gastric parietal cell, an acidic environment, to active _sulfenamide_ derivatives. This active form then makes disulfide bonds with important cysteines on the gastric acid pump, inhibiting its function.[A174247] Specifically, pantoprazole binds to the _sulfhydryl group_ of H+, K+-ATPase, which is an enzyme implicated in accelerating the final step in the acid secretion pathway. The enzyme is inactivated, inhibiting gastric acid secretion.[A174253] The inhibition of gastric acid secretion is stronger with proton pump inhibitors such as pantoprazole and lasts longer than with the H(2) antagonists.[A174295] ', 'This drug acts to decrease gastric acid secretion, which reduces stomach acidity. Pantoprazole administration leads to long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion.[F3193]



**General Effects**



Pantoprazole has been shown to reduce acid reflux-related symptoms, heal inflammation of the esophagus, and improve patient quality of life more effectively than histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2 blockers). This drug has an excellent safety profile and a low incidence of drug interactions. It can be used safely in various high-risk patient populations, including the elderly and those with renal failure or moderate hepatic dysfunction.[A174226]



Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as pantoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]



PPIs such as pantoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes [A177577, A177580]. 



**A note on laboratory testing abnormalities**



During treatment with antisecretory medicinal products such as pantoprazole, serum gastrin (a peptide hormone that stimulates secretion of gastric acid) increases in response to the decreased acid secretion caused by proton pump inhibition. The increased gastrin level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Published evidence suggests that proton pump inhibitors should be stopped 14 days before chromogranin A (CgA) measurements. This permits chromogranin A levels, that might be falsely elevated after proton pump inhibitor treatment, to return to the normal reference range.[F3217] 



Reports have been made of false-positive results in urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving the majority of proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole. A confirmatory method should be used.[F3217]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Unique among the azoles, miconazole is thought to act through three main mechanisms.[A203636] The primary mechanism of action is through inhibition of the CYP450 14α-lanosterol demethylase enzyme, which results in altered ergosterol production and impaired cell membrane composition and permeability, which in turn leads to cation, phosphate, and low molecular weight protein leakage.[A203636, A203639]



In addition, miconazole inhibits fungal peroxidase and catalase while not affecting NADH oxidase activity, leading to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).[A203636, A203639, A203642] Increased intracellular ROS leads to downstream pleiotropic effects and eventual apoptosis.[A203636]



Lastly, likely as a result of lanosterol demethylation inhibition, miconazole causes a rise in intracellular levels of farnesol. This molecule participates in quorum sensing in _Candida_, preventing the transition from yeast to mycelial forms and thereby the formation of biofilms, which are more resistant to antibiotics.[A203645, A203648] In addition, farnesol is an inhibitor of drug efflux ABC transporters, namely _Candida_ CaCdr1p and CaCdr2p, which may additionally contribute to increased effectiveness of azole drugs.[A203648]', 'Miconazole is an azole antifungal that functions primarily through inhibition of a specific demethylase within the CYP450 complex.[A203636] As miconazole is typically applied topically and is minimally absorbed into the systemic circulation following application, the majority of patient reactions are limited to hypersensitivity and cases of anaphylaxis.[L14021] Patients using intravaginal miconazole products are advised not to rely on contraceptives to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, as well as not to use tampons concurrently.[L14027]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Two types of alpha receptors, alpha 1 and alpha 2, both play a role in regulating blood pressure.  Alpha-1 receptors are postsynaptic (located after the nerve junction, or space between a nerve fiber and target tissue). In this case, the target tissue is the vascular smooth muscle [L5837].  These receptors, when activated, increase blood pressure [A176648]. 



Prazosin inhibits the postsynaptic alpha-1 adrenoceptors. This inhibition blocks the vasoconstricting (narrowing) effect of catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) on the vessels, leading to peripheral blood vessel dilation.  Through blood vessel constriction by adrenergic receptor activation, epinephrine and norepinephrine normally act to increase blood pressure [A176654].

Normally, calcium ions serve as intracellular messengers or activators in exictable cells including vascular smooth muscles. The influx of calcium ultimately causes the excitation and depolarization of the tissues. Lacidipine inhibits the contractile function in the vascular smooth muscle and reduce blood pressure. Due to its high membrane partition coefficient, some studies suggest that lacidipine may reach the receptor via a two-step process; it first binds and accumulates in the membrane lipid bilayer and then diffuses within the membrane to the calcium channel receptor [A31543]. It is proposed that lacidipine preferentially blocks the inactivated state of the calcium channel [A31543].



Through its antioxidant properties shared amongst other dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, lacidipine demonstrates an additional clinical benefit. Its antiatherosclerotic effects are mediated by suppressing the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent inflammatory actions by chemokines, cytokines and adhesion molecules, thus reducing atherosclerotic lesion formation [A31540].

Action on the external urinary sphincter is mediated via duloxetine''s CNS effects. Increased serotonin and norepinephrine concentrations in Onuf''s nucleus leads to increased activation of 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, and α<sub>1</sub> adrenergic receptors.[A178663,A178666] 5-HT<sub>2</sub> and α<sub>1</sub> are both G<sub>q</sub> coupled and their activation increases the activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C (IP<sub>3</sub>/PLC) pathway.[T116] This pathway leads to release of intracellular calcium stores, increasing intracellular calcium concentrations, and facilitating neuronal excitability. 5-HT<sub>3</sub> functions as a ligand-gated sodium channel which allows sodium to flow into the neuron when activated. Increased flow of sodium into the neuron contributes to depolarization and activation of voltage gated channels involved in action potential generation. The combined action of these three receptors contributes to increased excitability of the pudendal motor nerve in response to glutamate.



Also related to duloxetine''s action at the spinal cord is its modulation of pain. Increasing the concentration of serotonin and norepinephrine in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord increases descending inhibition of pain through activation of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic, and α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors.[A178705] 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, and α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic mediate neuronal activation as described above. The activated neuron in this case is the GABAergic inhibitory interneuron which synapses onto the nociceptive projection neuron to inhibit the transmission of painful stimuli to the brain. The 5-HT<sub>1</sub> and α<sub>2</sub> receptors are G<sub>i</sub>/G<sub>o</sub> coupled and their activation leads to increased potassium current through inward rectifier channels and decreased adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A signaling which contributes to neuronal inhibition.[A178705,T116] These inhibitory receptors are present on the projection neuron itself as well as the dorsal root ganglion which precedes it and serves to directly suppress the transmission of painful stimuli.



The mechanisms involved in duloxetine''s benefits in depression and anxiety have not been fully elucidated. Dysfunctional serotonin and norepinephrine signaling are thought to be involved and increases in the availability of these neurotransmitters at the synaptic cleft thought to mediate a therapeutic effect.[A178666] It is postulated that the involvement of serotonin and norepinephrine in area responsible for emotional modulation such as the limbic system contributes to the effects in mood disorders specifically but this has yet to be confirmed.



Duloxetine''s hypertensive effect is related to its intended pharmacological effect. Increased availability of norepinephrine leads to activation of adrenergic receptors on the vascular endothelium. Since the action of α<sub>1</sub> receptors predominates, vasoconstriction results as the G<sub>q</sub> coupled receptor mediates calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum to facilitate smooth muscle contraction.[T116]', 'Duloxetine, through increasing serotonin and norepinephrine concentrations in Onuf''s nucleus, enhances glutamatergic activation of the pudendal motor nerve which innervates the external urethral sphinter.[A178663,A178666] This enhanced signaling allows for stronger contraction. Increased contraction of this sphincter increases the pressure needed to produce an incontinence episode in stress urinary incontinence. Duloxetine has been shown to improve Patient Global Impression of Improvement and Incontinence Quality of Life scores.[A178669] It has also been shown to reduce the median incontinence episode frequency at doses of 40 and 80 mg.



Action at the dorsal horn of the spinal cord allows duloxetine to strengthen the the serotonergic and adrenergic pathways involved in descending inhibition of pain.[A178666,A178705] This results in an increased threshold of activation necessary to transmit painful stimuli to the brain and effective relief of pain, particularly in neuropathic pain. Pain relief has been noted in a variety of painful conditions including diabetic peripheral neuropathy, fibromyalgia, and osteoarthritis using a range of pain assessment surveys.[A178711]



While duloxetine has been shown to be effective in both animal models of mood disorders and in clinical trials for the treatment of these disorders in humans, the broad scope of its pharmacodynamic effects on mood regulation in the brain has yet to be explained.[A178714]

Vestibular forms of vertigo are often accompanied by auditory dysfunctions such as hyperacusis, hearing loss, and tinnitus.[A220328] In most cases, adaptive mechanisms of the CNS lead to functional recovery after episodes of vertigo, however, syndromes such as Ménière''s disease tend to cause the recurrence of vertigo symptoms. This significantly impacts the quality of life and the ability to carry out daily activities.[A220318] 



**H1-receptor activity**



The mechanism of action of betahistine is multifactorial. Ménière''s disease is thought to result from a disruption of endolymphatic fluid homeostasis in the ear.[A220438] Betahistine mainly acts as a histamine H1-receptor agonist. The stimulation of H1-receptors in the inner ear causes a vasodilatory effect leading to increased permeability of blood vessels and a reduction in endolymphatic pressure; this action prevents the rupture of the labyrinth, which can contribute to the hearing loss associated with  Ménière''s disease. Betahistine is also purported to act by reducing the asymmetrical functioning of sensory vestibular organs and increasing vestibulocochlear blood flow, relieving symptoms of vertigo.[A220433]



**H3-receptor activity**



In addition to the above mechanisms, betahistine also acts as a histamine H3-receptor antagonist, increasing the turnover of histamine from postsynaptic histaminergic nerve receptors, subsequently leading to an increase in H1-agonist activity. H3-receptor antagonism elevates levels of neurotransmitters including serotonin in the brainstem, inhibiting the activity of vestibular nuclei, thus restoring proper balance and decreasing vertigo symptoms.[A220328]', 'Through its actions on the histamine receptors, betahistine provides relief from vertigo associated with Ménière''s disease.[A220328,A220433,L16388] ', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Animal research studies have demonstrated that carbamazepine exerts its effects by lowering polysynaptic nerve response and inhibiting post-tetanic potentiation. In both cats and rats, carbamazepine was shown to decrease pain caused by infraorbital nerve stimulation. A decrease in the action potential in the nucleus ventralis of the thalamus in the brain and inhibition of the lingual mandibular reflex were observed in other studies after carbamazepine use. Carbamazepine causes the above effects by binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels and preventing action potentials, which normally lead to stimulatory effects on nerves.[A180403,T634] In bipolar disorder, carbamazepine is thought to increase dopamine turnover and increase GABA transmission, treating manic and depressive symptoms.[L7216]



A common issue that has arisen is resistance to this drug in up to 30% of epileptic patients, which may occur to altered metabolism in patients with variant genotypes.[A180436] A potential therapeutic target to combat carbamazepine resistance has recently been identified as the EPHX1 gene promoter, potentially conferring resistance to carbamazepine through methylation.[A180439]', '**General effects**



Carbamazepine treats seizures and the symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia by inhibiting sodium channels.

The retention of phosphate plays a pivotal role in causing secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with osteodystrophy, and soft-tissue calcification. The mechanism by which phosphate retention leads to hyperparathyroidism is not clearly delineated. Therapeutic efforts directed toward the control of hyperphosphatemia include reduction in the dietary intake of phosphate, inhibition of absorption of phosphate in the intestine with phosphate binders, and removal of phosphate from the body by more efficient methods of dialysis. The rate of removal of phosphate by dietary manipulation or by dialysis is insufficient. Dialysis patients absorb 40% to 80% of dietary phosphorus. Therefore, the fraction of dietary phosphate absorbed from the diet needs to be reduced by using phosphate binders in most renal failure patients on maintenance dialysis. Calcium acetate when taken with meals combines with dietary phosphate to form insoluble calcium phosphate which is excreted in the feces. Maintenance of serum phosphorus below 6.0 mg/dl is generally considered as a clinically acceptable outcome of treatment with phosphate binders.

Resistance: viral genetic determinants resulting in variable response to ribavirin therapy has not been yet determined. ', 'Ribavirin is reported to have several mechanism of actions that lead to inhibition of viral RNA and protein synthesis. 

After activation by adenosine kinase to ribavirin mono-, di-, and triphosphate metabolites. Ribavirin triphosphate (RTP) is the predominant metabolite which directly inhibits viral mRNA polymerase by binding to the nucleotide binding site of the enzyme. This prevents the binding of the correct nucleotides, leading to a reduction in viral replication or to the production of defective virions [A19645]. RTP also demonstrates an inhibitory action on viral mRNA guanylyltransferase and mRNA 2′-O-methyltransferase of dengue virus. Inhibition of these enzymes disrupts the posttranslational capping of the 5′ end of viral mRNA through ribavirin being incorporated at the 5′ end in place of guanosine and preventing the cap methylation step. 



Inhibition of host inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and subsequent depletion of GTP pool is proposed to be another mechanism of action of ribavirin. IMPDH catalyzes the rate-limiting step where inosine 5′-monophosphate is converted to xanthine monophosphate during guanosine monophosphate (GMP) synthesis. GMP is later converted to guanosine triphoshpate (GTP). Ribavirin monophosphate mimics inosine 5′-monophosphate and acts as a competitive inhibitor of IMPDH. Inhibited de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides and decreased intracellular GTP pools leads to a decline in viral protein synthesis and limit replication of viral genomes [A19645].



Ribavirin acts as a mutagen in the target virus to cause an ''error catastrophe'' due to increased viral mutations. RTP pairs with cytidine triphosphate or uridine triphosphate with equal efficiency and to block HCV RNA elongation. It causes premature termination of nascent HCV RNA and increases mutagenesis by producing defective virions [A19645].



Ribavirin also exerts an immunomodulatory action of the host to the virus by shifting a Th2 response in favor of a Th1 phenotype. Th2 response and production of type 2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 stimulates the humoral response which enhances immunity toward the virus [A19645]. Ribavirin enhanced induction of interferon-related genes, including the interferon-α receptor, and down-regulation of genes involved in interferon inhibition, apoptosis, and hepatic stellate cell activation in vitro [A19644]. ', 'Ribavirin mediates direct antiviral activity against a number of DNA and RNA viruses by increasing the mutation frequency in the genomes of several RNA viruses. It is a member of the nucleoside antimetabolite drugs that interfere with duplication of the viral genetic material.

Pentoxyverine acts as an agonist at sigma receptors with the Ki of 75±28 nM, as demonstrated in a competitive binding assay [A32715]. The function of sigma receptors on cough suppressant activities is unclear, however these receptors are highly expressed in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) of the brainstem where the afferent fibres first synapse [A32715]. NTS is located very close to the cough centre in the brainstem thus may function as a ‘gate'' for the cough reflex and allow sigma-1 receptor agonists to modulate afferent activity prior to reaching the cough center [A32715]. It is suggested that highly lipophilic sigma-1 agonists may penetrate the CNS following systemic administration. When administered as aerosols, sigma-1 receptor agonists may temporarily act in the periphery to modulate cough by acting activate sigma receptors expressed in the lungs [A32715]. However there is limited evidence of peripheral localization of the sigma agonists following aerosol administration and the ruling out of systemic exposure [A32715].

The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism and catabolism. In humans, insulin is stored in the form of hexamers; however, only insulin monomers are able to interact with IR. Reversal of the proline and lysine residues at positions B28 and B29 of native insulin eliminates hydrophobic interactions and weakens some of the hydrogen bonds that contribute to the stability of the insulin dimers that comprise insulin hexamers. Hexamers of insulin lispro are produced in the presence of zinc and <i>m</i>-cresol. These weakly associated hexamers quickly dissociate upon subcutaneous injection and are absorbed as monomers through vascular endothelial cells. These properties give insulin lispro its fast-acting properties. ', 'Insulin is a natural hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas. In non-diabetic individuals, a basal level of insulin is supplemented with insulin spikes following meals. Increased insulin secretion following meals is responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to absorptive state. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. Insulin also promotes growth and is required for the actions of growth hormone (e.g. protein synthesis, cell division, DNA synthesis). Insulin lispro is a rapid-acting insulin analogue used to mimic postprandial insulin spikes in diabetic individuals. The onset of action of insulin lispro is 10-15 minutes. Its activity peaks 60 minutes following subcutaneous injection and its duration of action is 4-5 hours. Compared to regular human insulin, insulin lispro  has a more rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of action. Insulin lispro is also shown to be equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis.  



Insulin lispro has been shown to be equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis. One unit of insulin lispro has the same glucose-lowering effect as one unit of regular human insulin.

As abovementioned, olanzapine presents a wide profile of targets, however, its antagonistic effect towards the dopamine D2 receptor in the mesolimbic pathway is key as it blocks dopamine from having a potential action at the post-synaptic receptor. The binding of olanzapine to the dopamine D2 receptors is easily dissociable and hence, it allows for a certain degree of dopamine neurotransmission.[A177014]



On the other hand, olanzapine acts in the serotonin 5HT2A receptors in the frontal cortex in a similar manner than the reported on dopamine D2 receptors.

This response is mediated by the release of nitric oxide (NO) from nerve terminals and endothelial cells, which stimulates the synthesis of cyclic GMP in smooth muscle cells. Cyclic GMP causes smooth muscle relaxation and increased blood flow into the corpus cavernosum. The tissue concentration of cyclic GMP is regulated by both the rates of synthesis and degradation via phosphodiesterases (PDEs), and the most abundant PDE in the human corpus cavernosum is PDE5.

', '**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].



Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].



In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].



There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].



Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].



The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. 



In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].



In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].



The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].', 'Zinc is involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of human proteins may bind zinc, in addition to hundreds of proteins that transport and traffic zinc. It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is an essential element for a proper sense of taste and smell and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations [L2211].



Studies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions [L2095]:



**Colds:** Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently [L2095].



**Wound healing:** Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements [L2095]. 



**Diahrrea**: Oral zinc supplements can reduce the symptoms of diarrhea in children with low levels of zinc, especially in cases of malnutrition [L2095].

PGE<sub>2</sub> is the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.[A179023] It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.[T116,A179023] PGE<sub>2</sub> activates the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled EP<sub>1</sub> receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE<sub>2</sub> also activates the EP<sub>4</sub> receptor, coupled to G<sub>s</sub>, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE<sub>2</sub> act via EP<sub>3</sub> to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP<sub>2</sub> to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI<sub>2</sub> is known to play a role via its G<sub>s</sub>-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.



PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP<sub>2</sub> receptors.[T116,A179044] Similarly to β adrenergic receptors these are G<sub>s</sub>-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE<sub>2</sub> also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.[T116] PGD<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP<sub>1</sub> receptor.[A179044] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.



PGE<sub>2</sub> can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory G<sub>q</sub> EP<sub>3</sub> receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.[T116] This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever.

(1) the treatment of erectile dysfunction [A175582, L5611, F3853, F3856, F3886]; and



(2) treatment of pulmonary hypertension, where:

a) the US FDA specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO Group I) in adults to improve exercise ability and delay clinical worsening [F3850]. The delay in clinical worsening was demonstrated when sildenafil was added to background epoprostenol therapy [F3850]. Studies establishing effectiveness were short-term (12 to 16 weeks), and included predominately patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class II-III symptoms and idiopathic etiology (71%) or associated with connective tissue disease (CTD) (25%) [F3850];



b) the Canadian product monograph specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of primary pulmonary arterial hypertension (PPH) or pulmonary hypertension secondary to connective tissue disease (CTD) in adult patients with WHO functional class II or III who have not responded to conventional therapy [F3859]. In addition, improvement in exercise ability and delay in clinical worsening was demonstrated in adult patients who were already stabilized on background epoprostenol therapy [F3859]; and



c) the EMA product information specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension classified as WHO functional class II and III, to improve exercise capacity [F3883]. Efficacy has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with connective tissue disease [F3883]. The EMA label also indicates sildenafil for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years old with pulmonary arterial hypertension [F3883]. Efficacy in terms of improvement of exercise capacity or pulmonary hemodynamics has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital heart disease [F3883].', 'Sildenafil is an oral therapy for erectile dysfunction [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. In the natural setting, i.e. with sexual stimulation, it restores impaired erectile function by increasing blood flow to the penis [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].



The physiological mechanism responsible for the erection of the penis involves the release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Nitric oxide then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].



Sildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in the corpus cavernosum, where PDE5 is responsible for degradation of cGMP [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Sildenafil has a peripheral site of action on erections [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum but potently enhances the relaxant effect of NO on this tissue [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. When the NO/cGMP pathway is activated, as occurs with sexual stimulation, inhibition of PDE5 by sildenafil results in increased corpus cavernosum levels of cGMP [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Therefore sexual stimulation is required in order for sildenafil to produce its intended beneficial pharmacological effects [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].



Moreover, apart from the presence of PDE5 in the corpus cavernosum of the penis, PDE5 is also present in the pulmonary vasculature [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614]. Sildenafil, therefore, increases cGMP within pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells resulting in relaxation [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614]. In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, this can lead to vasodilation of the pulmonary vascular bed and, to a lesser degree, vasodilatation in the systemic circulation [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614].', 'In vitro studies have shown that sildenafil is selective for phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Its effect is more potent on PDE5 than on other known phosphodiesterases [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. In particular, there is a 10-times selectivity over PDE6 which is involved in the phototransduction pathway in the retina [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. There is an 80-times selectivity over PDE1, and over 700-times over PDE 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. And finally, sildenafil has greater than 4,000-times selectivity for PDE5 over PDE3, the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase isoform involved in the control of cardiac contractility [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



In eight double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies of patients with either organic or psychogenic erectile dysfunction, sexual stimulation resulted in improved erections, as assessed by an objective measurement of hardness and duration of erections (via the use of RigiScan®), after sildenafil administration compared with placebo [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Most studies assessed the efficacy of sildenafil approximately 60 minutes post-dose [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The erectile response, as assessed by RigiScan®, generally increased with increasing sildenafil dose and plasma concentration [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The time course of effect was examined in one study, showing an effect for up to 4 hours but the response was diminished compared to 2 hours [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



Sildenafil causes mild and transient decreases in systemic blood pressure which, in the majority of cases, do not translate into clinical effects [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg, three times a day to patients with systemic hypertension the mean change from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was a decrease of 9.4 mmHg and 9.1 mmHg respectively [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg, three times a day to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension lesser effects in blood pressure reduction were observed (a reduction in both systolic and diastolic pressure of 2 mmHg)[F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614] . At the recommended dose of 20 mg three times a day no reductions in systolic or diastolic pressure were seen [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



Single oral doses of sildenafil up to 100 mg in healthy volunteers produced no clinically relevant effects on ECG [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg three times a day to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension no clinically relevant effects on the ECG were reported either [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



In a study of the hemodynamic effects of a single oral 100 mg dose of sildenafil in 14 patients with severe coronary artery disease (CAD) (> 70 % stenosis of at least one coronary artery), the mean resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased by 7 % and 6 % respectively compared to baseline [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Mean pulmonary systolic blood pressure decreased by 9% [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Sildenafil showed no effect on cardiac output and did not impair blood flow through the stenosed coronary arteries [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



Mild and transient differences in color discrimination (blue/green) were detected in some subjects using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test at 1 hour following a 100 mg dose, with no effects evident after 2 hours post-dose [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The postulated mechanism for this change in color discrimination is related to inhibition of PDE6, which is involved in the phototransduction cascade of the retina [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Sildenafil has no effect on visual acuity or contrast sensitivity. In a small size placebo-controlled study of patients with documented early age-related macular degeneration (n = 9), sildenafil (single dose, 100 mg) demonstrated no significant changes in visual tests conducted (which included visual acuity, Amsler grid, color discrimination simulated traffic light, and the Humphrey perimeter and photostress test) [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

About 85% of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) cases are B-cell lymphomas, characterized by the high expression of CD19, CD20 and CD22 cell surface antigens.[A248980] CD20 is involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis and calcium signaling. By targeting CD20, rituximab promotes cell lysis while sparing hematopoietic and plasma cells without this surface antigen.[A40017,A248980] It has been suggested that cell lysis mechanisms triggered by rituximab include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) [L26641]. Rituximab is part of the immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) subclass of antibodies, and is formed by a murine variable region (Fab region) and a human constant region (Fc region). The Fab region gives rituximab its specificity for CD20, while the Fc region interacts with cell surface receptors to activate the immune system, leading to the depletion of circulating B lymphocytes [A40017].



In regards to the mechanism of action in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), B-cells are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of RA and the associated condition of chronic synovitis.[L26641] B-cells may act at various sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process through the production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and the production of proinflammatory cytokines [L26641]. The administration of rituximab in this condition has resulted in significant clinical and symptomatic improvements [A125,L26641]. Rituximab is also indicated for the treatment of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), two conditions characterized by the presence of circulating antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and increased B-cell activity. It has been suggested that rituximab depletes CD20<sup>+</sup> B-cells at a higher rate in GPA and MPA patients with high levels of Fc receptor-like 5 (FCRL5).[A248985]', 'Rituximab is a chimeric murine/human monoclonal antibody that binds to the CD20 antigen. CD20 is predominantly expressed on the surface of pre-B and mature B-lymphocytes, allowing rituximab to target and promote lysis in this specific type of cells.[A40017,A248980,L26641]. In Non-Hodgkin''s Lymphoma patients, rituximab treatment depleted circulating and tissue-based B-cells. In a study that included 166 patients, CD19-positive B-cells were depleted within three weeks, and in 83% of patients, cell depletion lasted up to 6-9 months. B-cell levels started to recover at approximately 6 months and returned to normal 12 months after treatment was completed. Approximately 14% of Non-Hodgkin''s Lymphoma patients had IgM or IgG serum levels below the normal range [L26641]. 



Most rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients treated with rituximab showed a near-complete depletion of peripheral B lymphocytes within 2 weeks after the first dose. Peripheral B-cell depletion was sustained for at least 6 months, and in approximately 4% of RA patients, peripheral B-cell depletion was sustained for more than 3 years after a single course of rituximab treatment.[L26641] Total IgG, IgA, and, more specifically, IgM levels were lower 24 weeks after the first cycle of rituximab treatment (2.8%, 0.8% and 10% below the lower limit of normal, respectively). However, the clinical consequences of this decrease in immunoglobulin levels in RA patients are not clear at this time. Treatment with rituximab in patients with RA was also associated with a decreased level of inflammation markers.[L26641]



In patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) treated with rituximab, CD19 B-cells in peripheral blood were depleted to less than 10 cells/μl after the first two infusions. By month 6, approximately 84% of patients had the same level of peripheral blood CD19 B-cells, and by month 12, 81% of patients demonstrated signs of B-cell return with counts >10 cells/μL. By Month 18, the majority of patients (87%) had counts >10 cells/μL [L26641].', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Resistance: viral genetic determinants resulting in variable response to ribavirin therapy has not been yet determined. ', 'Ribavirin is reported to have several mechanism of actions that lead to inhibition of viral RNA and protein synthesis. 

After activation by adenosine kinase to ribavirin mono-, di-, and triphosphate metabolites. Ribavirin triphosphate (RTP) is the predominant metabolite which directly inhibits viral mRNA polymerase by binding to the nucleotide binding site of the enzyme. This prevents the binding of the correct nucleotides, leading to a reduction in viral replication or to the production of defective virions [A19645]. RTP also demonstrates an inhibitory action on viral mRNA guanylyltransferase and mRNA 2′-O-methyltransferase of dengue virus. Inhibition of these enzymes disrupts the posttranslational capping of the 5′ end of viral mRNA through ribavirin being incorporated at the 5′ end in place of guanosine and preventing the cap methylation step. 



Inhibition of host inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and subsequent depletion of GTP pool is proposed to be another mechanism of action of ribavirin. IMPDH catalyzes the rate-limiting step where inosine 5′-monophosphate is converted to xanthine monophosphate during guanosine monophosphate (GMP) synthesis. GMP is later converted to guanosine triphoshpate (GTP). Ribavirin monophosphate mimics inosine 5′-monophosphate and acts as a competitive inhibitor of IMPDH. Inhibited de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides and decreased intracellular GTP pools leads to a decline in viral protein synthesis and limit replication of viral genomes [A19645].



Ribavirin acts as a mutagen in the target virus to cause an ''error catastrophe'' due to increased viral mutations. RTP pairs with cytidine triphosphate or uridine triphosphate with equal efficiency and to block HCV RNA elongation. It causes premature termination of nascent HCV RNA and increases mutagenesis by producing defective virions [A19645].



Ribavirin also exerts an immunomodulatory action of the host to the virus by shifting a Th2 response in favor of a Th1 phenotype. Th2 response and production of type 2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 stimulates the humoral response which enhances immunity toward the virus [A19645]. Ribavirin enhanced induction of interferon-related genes, including the interferon-α receptor, and down-regulation of genes involved in interferon inhibition, apoptosis, and hepatic stellate cell activation in vitro [A19644].

', '**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].



Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].



In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].



There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].



Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].



The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. 



In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].



In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].



The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].', 'Zinc is involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of human proteins may bind zinc, in addition to hundreds of proteins that transport and traffic zinc. It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is an essential element for a proper sense of taste and smell and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations [L2211].



Studies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions [L2095]:



**Colds:** Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently [L2095].



**Wound healing:** Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements [L2095]. 



**Diahrrea**: Oral zinc supplements can reduce the symptoms of diarrhea in children with low levels of zinc, especially in cases of malnutrition [L2095].

Its combination of orthosteric and allosteric activity on SERT allows for greater extracellular 5-HT levels, a faster onset of action, and greater efficacy as compared to other SSRIs. [A185825,A185726] The sustained elevation of synaptic 5-HT eventually causes desensitization of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> auto-receptors, which normally shut down endogenous 5-HT release in the presence of excess 5-HT - this desensitization may be necessary for the full clinical effect of SSRIs and may be responsible for their typically prolonged onset of action.[A185828,A185726]



Escitalopram has shown little-to-no binding affinity at a number of other receptors, such as histamine and muscarinic receptors, and minor activity at these off-targets may explain some of its adverse effects.[L8513,L8516,L8522,A185726]', 'Escitalopram belongs to a class of medications called selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs).

Action on the external urinary sphincter is mediated via duloxetine''s CNS effects. Increased serotonin and norepinephrine concentrations in Onuf''s nucleus leads to increased activation of 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, and α<sub>1</sub> adrenergic receptors.[A178663,A178666] 5-HT<sub>2</sub> and α<sub>1</sub> are both G<sub>q</sub> coupled and their activation increases the activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C (IP<sub>3</sub>/PLC) pathway.[T116] This pathway leads to release of intracellular calcium stores, increasing intracellular calcium concentrations, and facilitating neuronal excitability. 5-HT<sub>3</sub> functions as a ligand-gated sodium channel which allows sodium to flow into the neuron when activated. Increased flow of sodium into the neuron contributes to depolarization and activation of voltage gated channels involved in action potential generation. The combined action of these three receptors contributes to increased excitability of the pudendal motor nerve in response to glutamate.



Also related to duloxetine''s action at the spinal cord is its modulation of pain. Increasing the concentration of serotonin and norepinephrine in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord increases descending inhibition of pain through activation of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic, and α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors.[A178705] 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, and α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic mediate neuronal activation as described above. The activated neuron in this case is the GABAergic inhibitory interneuron which synapses onto the nociceptive projection neuron to inhibit the transmission of painful stimuli to the brain. The 5-HT<sub>1</sub> and α<sub>2</sub> receptors are G<sub>i</sub>/G<sub>o</sub> coupled and their activation leads to increased potassium current through inward rectifier channels and decreased adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A signaling which contributes to neuronal inhibition.[A178705,T116] These inhibitory receptors are present on the projection neuron itself as well as the dorsal root ganglion which precedes it and serves to directly suppress the transmission of painful stimuli.



The mechanisms involved in duloxetine''s benefits in depression and anxiety have not been fully elucidated. Dysfunctional serotonin and norepinephrine signaling are thought to be involved and increases in the availability of these neurotransmitters at the synaptic cleft thought to mediate a therapeutic effect.[A178666] It is postulated that the involvement of serotonin and norepinephrine in area responsible for emotional modulation such as the limbic system contributes to the effects in mood disorders specifically but this has yet to be confirmed.



Duloxetine''s hypertensive effect is related to its intended pharmacological effect. Increased availability of norepinephrine leads to activation of adrenergic receptors on the vascular endothelium. Since the action of α<sub>1</sub> receptors predominates, vasoconstriction results as the G<sub>q</sub> coupled receptor mediates calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum to facilitate smooth muscle contraction.[T116]', 'Duloxetine, through increasing serotonin and norepinephrine concentrations in Onuf''s nucleus, enhances glutamatergic activation of the pudendal motor nerve which innervates the external urethral sphinter.[A178663,A178666] This enhanced signaling allows for stronger contraction. Increased contraction of this sphincter increases the pressure needed to produce an incontinence episode in stress urinary incontinence. Duloxetine has been shown to improve Patient Global Impression of Improvement and Incontinence Quality of Life scores.[A178669] It has also been shown to reduce the median incontinence episode frequency at doses of 40 and 80 mg.



Action at the dorsal horn of the spinal cord allows duloxetine to strengthen the the serotonergic and adrenergic pathways involved in descending inhibition of pain.[A178666,A178705] This results in an increased threshold of activation necessary to transmit painful stimuli to the brain and effective relief of pain, particularly in neuropathic pain. Pain relief has been noted in a variety of painful conditions including diabetic peripheral neuropathy, fibromyalgia, and osteoarthritis using a range of pain assessment surveys.[A178711]



While duloxetine has been shown to be effective in both animal models of mood disorders and in clinical trials for the treatment of these disorders in humans, the broad scope of its pharmacodynamic effects on mood regulation in the brain has yet to be explained.[A178714]

• Angiographically documented coronary artery disease in patients without heart failure or an ejection fraction < 40%', '**Mechanism of action on blood pressure**



Amlodipine is considered a peripheral arterial vasodilator that exerts its action directly on vascular smooth muscle to lead to a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance, causing a decrease in blood pressure. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow-channel blocker) that inhibits the influx of calcium ions into both vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Experimental studies imply that amlodipine binds to both _dihydropyridine_ and _nondihydropyridine_ binding sites, located on cell membranes. The contraction of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent on the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells by specific ion channels. Amlodipine blocks calcium ion influx across cell membranes with selectivity. A stronger effect of amlodipine is exerted on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells [FDA label]. Direct actions of amlodipine on vascular smooth muscle result in reduced blood pressure [F3757]. 



**Mechanism of action in angina**



The exact mechanism by which amlodipine relieves the symptoms of angina have not been fully elucidated to this date, however, the mechanism of action is likely twofold:



Amlodipine has a dilating effect on peripheral arterioles, reducing the total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the cardiac muscle functions. Since the heart rate remains stable during amlodipine administration, the reduced work of the heart reduces both myocardial energy use and oxygen requirements [F3757].



Dilatation of the main coronary arteries and coronary arterioles, both in healthy and ischemic areas, is another possible mechanism of amlodipine reduction of blood pressure. The dilatation causes an increase in myocardial oxygen delivery in patients experiencing coronary artery spasm (Prinzmetal''s or variant angina) and reduces coronary vasoconstriction caused by smoking [F3757].', '**General pharmacodynamic effects**



Amlodipine has a strong affinity for cell membranes, modulating calcium influx by inhibiting selected membrane calcium channels. This drug''s unique binding properties allow for its long-acting action and less frequent dosing regimen [A573], [FDA label].  



**Hemodynamic effects**



After the administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine to patients diagnosed with hypertension, amlodipine causes vasodilation, which results in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressure. During these blood pressure reductions, there are no clinically significant changes in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with long-term use. Acute intravenous administration of amlodipine reduces arterial blood pressure and increases heart rate in patients with chronic stable angina, however, chronic oral administration of amlodipine in clinical studies did not cause clinically significant alterations in heart rate or blood pressures in patients diagnosed with angina and normal blood pressure. With long-term, once daily oral administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours [FDA label]. 



**Electrophysiologic effects**



Amlodipine does not change sinoatrial (SA) nodal function or atrioventricular (AV) conduction in animals or humans. In patients who were diagnosed with chronic stable angina, the intravenous administration of 10 mg of amlodipine did not cause clinically significant alterations A-H and H-V conduction and sinus node recovery time after cardiac pacing. Patients administered amlodipine with concomitant beta-blockers produced similar results. In clinical trials in which amlodipine was given in combination with beta-blockers to patients diagnosed with hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were noted. In clinical studies comprised of angina patients alone, amlodipine did not change electrocardiographic intervals or produce high degrees of AV block [FDA label]. 



**Effects on angina**



Amlodipine relieves the symptoms of chest pain associated with angina.

While the following have been observed, the clinical significance of these observations in atopic dermatitis is not known. It has been demonstrated that tacrolimus inhibits T-lymphocyte activation by first binding to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12. A complex of tacrolimus-FKBP-12, calcium, calmodulin, and calcineurin is then formed and the phosphatase activity of calcineurin is inhibited. This prevents the dephosphorylation and translocation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NF-AT), a nuclear component thought to initiate gene transcription for the formation of lymphokines. Tacrolimus also inhibits the transcription for genes which encode IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, GM-CSF, and TNF-, all of which are involved in the early stages of T-cell activation. Additionally, tacrolimus has been shown to inhibit the release of pre-formed mediators from skin mast cells and basophils, and to downregulate the expression of FceRI on Langerhans cells.', 'Tacrolimus acts by reducing peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity by binding to the immunophilin FKBP-12 (FK506 binding protein) creating a new complex. This inhibits both T-lymphocyte signal transduction and IL-2 transcription. Tacrolimus has similar activity to cyclosporine but rates of rejection are lower with tacrolimus. Tacrolimus has also been shown to be effective in the topical treatment of eczema, particularly atopic eczema. It suppresses inflammation in a similar way to steroids, but is not as powerful. An important dermatological advantage of tacrolimus is that it can be used directly on the face; topical steroids cannot be used on the face, as they thin the skin dramatically there.

Furthermore, some formulations like chewable montelukast tablets may also be specifically indicated by particular regulatory bodies for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma, including the prevention of day and night-time symptoms, the treatment of acetylsalicylic acid based asthma, and the prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in adult and pediatric patients aged 2 and older[L6328], between the ages 2 and 5[L6325], or between the ages of 6 and 14 years.[L6331]



Moreover, when employed for such indications montelukast is considered effective as monotherapy or when combined with other medications indicated for the maintenance treatment of chronic asthma.[L6304,L6328] For instance, montelukast and inhaled corticosteroids can be used concomitantly to demonstrate additive effects to control asthma or to decrease the necessary inhaled corticosteroid dose while still maintaining clinical stability.[L6304,L6328]



Additionally, in patients who continue to experience asthma symptoms, montelukast can also be combined with an ''as required'' short-acting beta-agonist, an inhaled corticosteroid, or inhaled corticosteroid paired with a long-acting beta-agonist.[L6304,L6328]', 'Cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLT) like LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4, among others, are eicosanoids released by a variety of cells like mast cells and eosinophils.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] When such CysLT bind to corresponding CysLT receptors like CysLT type-1 receptors located on respiratory airway smooth muscle cells, airway macrophages, and on various pro-inflammatory cells like eosinophils and some specific myeloid stem cells activities that facilitate the pathophysiology of asthma and allergic rhinitis are stimulated.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]



In particular, CysLT-mediated airway bronchoconstriction, occluding mucous secretion, vascular permeability, and eosinophil recruitment are all types of effects that facilitate asthma.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Alternatively, in allergic rhinitis, CysLTs are released by the nasal mucosa when exposed to allergens during both early and late phase reactions and participate in eliciting symptoms of allergic rhinitis like a congested nose and airway.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]



Subsequently, montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that binds with high affinity and selectivity to the CysLT type 1 receptor, which consequently assists in inhibiting any physiological actions of CysLTs like LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 at the receptor that may facilitate asthma or allergic rhinitis.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]', 'Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that demonstrates a marked affinity and selectivity to the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor type-1 in preference to many other crucial airway receptors like the prostanoid, cholinergic, or beta-adrenergic receptors.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] As a consequence, the agent can elicit substantial blockage of LTD4 leukotriene-mediated bronchoconstriction with doses as low as 5 mg.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Moreover, a placebo-controlled, crossover study (n=12) demonstrated that montelukast is capable of inhibiting early and late phase bronchoconstriction caused by antigen challenge by 75% and 57% respectively.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]



In particular, it has been documented that montelukast can cause bronchodilation as soon as within 2 hours of oral administration.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] This action can also be additive to the bronchodilation caused by the concomitant use of a beta agonist.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Nevertheless, clinical investigations performed with adults 15 years of age and older revealed that no additional clinical benefit is obtained when doses of montelukast greater than 10 mg a day are used.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]



Additionally, in clinical trials with adults and pediatric asthmatic patients aged 6 to 14 years, it was also determined that montelukast can reduce mean peripheral blood eosinophils by about 13% to 15% from baseline in comparison to placebo during double-blind treatment periods.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] At the same time, in patients aged 15 years and older who were experiencing seasonal allergic rhinitis, the use of montelukast caused a median reduction of 13% in peripheral blood eosinophil counts when compared to placebo as well.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

These include N-(2-hydroxyethyl) oxamic acid and acetamide, which may damage DNA of replicating organisms.[A181039]', 'Metronidazole treats amebiasis, trichomoniasis, and giardiasis, exerting both antibacterial and antiprotozoal activities.[L7432] Metronidazole is an effective treatment for some anaerobic bacterial infections.[A181057] Metronidazole has shown antibacterial activity against the majority of obligate anaerobes, however, during in vitro studies, it does not demonstrate significant action against facultative anaerobes or obligate aerobes.[L3754] The nitro group reduction of metronidazole by anaerobic organisms is likely responsible for the drug''s antimicrobial cytotoxic effects, causing DNA strand damage to microbes.[A181039,A181045]



A note on convulsions and neuropathy and carcinogenesis



It is important to be aware of the risk of peripheral neuropathy and convulsions associated with metronidazole, especially at higher doses. If convulsions or numbness of an extremity occur, discontinue the drug immediately.[L3754] Metronidazole has been found to be carcinogenic in mice and rats.

Indicated for the management of asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction in patients with an ejection fraction of ≤ to 35 percent to decrease the rate of development of overt heart failure and the incidence of hospitalization for heart failure.[label]', 'The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a signaling pathway that works in synergism with the sympathetic system to regulate blood pressure and fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. Activation of this system upon stimulation by different factors, such as low blood pressure and nerve impulses, leads to increased release of norepinephrine (NE) from sympathetic nerve terminals and effects on the vascular growth, vasoconstriction, and salt retention in the kidneys.[T28] Renin is released from 

Renin acts on the precursor prottein angiotensinogen, which is a plasma globulin synthesized from the liver, to produce cleaved peptide hormone angiotensin I.[T28] Angiotensin I then can be further cleaved by ACE to produce angiotensin II, a vasoconstrictive peptide hormone.[label] Present in different isoforms, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is peptidyl dipeptidase enzyme expressed in various tissues, including the vascular tissues, such as the heart, brain, and kidneys.[T28] ACE also plays a role in inactivation of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide.[T28,label] Angiotensin II mediates various actions on the body by working on its G-protein coupled receptors, AT1 and AT2.[T28] It causes direct vasoconstriction of precapillary arterioles and postcapillary venules, inhibits the reuptake of NE thereby increasing available levels, stimulates the release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla, reduces urinary excretion of sodium ions and water by promoting proximal tubular reabsorption, stimulates synthesis and release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, and stimulates hypertrophy of both vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiac myocytes.[L6619]



Enalapril is a pharmacologically inactive prodrug that requires hepatic biotransformation to form [enalaprilat], its active metabolite that works on the RAAS to inhibit ACE.[label] Biotransformation is critial for the therapeutic actions of the drug, as enalapril itself is only a weak inhibitor of ACE.[A179131] ACE inhibition results in reduced production and plasma levels of angiotensin II, increased plasma renin activity due to the loss of feedback inhibition by angiotensin II, and decreased aldosterone secretion.[L6586] However, plasma aldosterone levels usually return to normal during long-term administration of enalapril.[A179140] Decreased levels of angiotensin II subsequently leads to the dilatation of peripheral vessles and reduced vascular resistance which in turn lower blood pressure.[A179140] While inhibition of ACE leading to suppression of RAAS is thought to be the primary mechanism of action of enalapril, the drug was shown to still exert antihypertensive effects on individuals with low-renin hypertension. It is suggested that enalapril may mediate its pharmacological actions via other modes of action that are not fully understood.[label] As ACE is structurally similar to kininase I, which is a carboxypeptidase that degrades bradykinin, whether increased levels of bradykinin play a role in the therapeutic effects of enalapril remains to be elucidated.[label]', 'Enalapril is an antihypertensive agent that exhibits natriuretic and uricosuric properties. Enalapril lowers blood pressure in all grades of essential and renovascular hypertension, and peripheral vascular resistance without causing an increase in heart rate.[A179137] Individuals with low-renin hypertensive population were still responsive to enalapril.[label] The duration of hypertensive effect in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure persists for at least 24 hours following initial administration of a single oral dose, and repeated daily administration of enalapril confers an additional reduction in blood pressure and a steady-state antihypertensive response may take several weeks.[A179140] In patients with severe congestive heart failure and inadequate clinical response to conventional antihypertensive therapies, treatment with enalapril resulted in improvements in cardiac performance as observed by a reduction in both preload and afterload, and improved clinical status long-term.[A179137] Furthermore, enalapril was shown to increase cardiac output and stroke volume while decreasing pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in patients with congestive heart failure refractory to conventional treatment with digitalis and diuretics. In clinical studies, enalapril reduced left ventricular mass, and did not affect cardiac function or myocardial perfusion during exercise.[A179134] Enalapril is not highly associated with the risk of bradycardia unlike most diuretics and beta-blockers [A179137] and it does not produce rebound hypertension upon discontinuation of therapy.[A179134] 



Enalapril is not reported to produce hypokalaemia, hyperglycaemia, hyperuricaemia or hypercholesterolaemia. In the kidneys, enalapril was shown to increase renal blood flow and decrease renal vascular resistance. It also augmented the glomerular filtration rate in patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 80 mL/min.[A179134] When used in combination, enalapril was shown to attenuate the extent of drug-induced hypokalemia caused by hydrochlorothiazide [A179137] and the antihypertensive effects of both drugs were potentiated.[A18459]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

(1) the treatment of erectile dysfunction [A175582, L5611, F3853, F3856, F3886]; and



(2) treatment of pulmonary hypertension, where:

a) the US FDA specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO Group I) in adults to improve exercise ability and delay clinical worsening [F3850]. The delay in clinical worsening was demonstrated when sildenafil was added to background epoprostenol therapy [F3850]. Studies establishing effectiveness were short-term (12 to 16 weeks), and included predominately patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class II-III symptoms and idiopathic etiology (71%) or associated with connective tissue disease (CTD) (25%) [F3850];



b) the Canadian product monograph specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of primary pulmonary arterial hypertension (PPH) or pulmonary hypertension secondary to connective tissue disease (CTD) in adult patients with WHO functional class II or III who have not responded to conventional therapy [F3859]. In addition, improvement in exercise ability and delay in clinical worsening was demonstrated in adult patients who were already stabilized on background epoprostenol therapy [F3859]; and



c) the EMA product information specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension classified as WHO functional class II and III, to improve exercise capacity [F3883]. Efficacy has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with connective tissue disease [F3883]. The EMA label also indicates sildenafil for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years old with pulmonary arterial hypertension [F3883]. Efficacy in terms of improvement of exercise capacity or pulmonary hemodynamics has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital heart disease [F3883].', 'Sildenafil is an oral therapy for erectile dysfunction [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. In the natural setting, i.e. with sexual stimulation, it restores impaired erectile function by increasing blood flow to the penis [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].



The physiological mechanism responsible for the erection of the penis involves the release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Nitric oxide then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].



Sildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in the corpus cavernosum, where PDE5 is responsible for degradation of cGMP [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Sildenafil has a peripheral site of action on erections [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum but potently enhances the relaxant effect of NO on this tissue [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. When the NO/cGMP pathway is activated, as occurs with sexual stimulation, inhibition of PDE5 by sildenafil results in increased corpus cavernosum levels of cGMP [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Therefore sexual stimulation is required in order for sildenafil to produce its intended beneficial pharmacological effects [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].



Moreover, apart from the presence of PDE5 in the corpus cavernosum of the penis, PDE5 is also present in the pulmonary vasculature [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614]. Sildenafil, therefore, increases cGMP within pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells resulting in relaxation [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614]. In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, this can lead to vasodilation of the pulmonary vascular bed and, to a lesser degree, vasodilatation in the systemic circulation [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614].', 'In vitro studies have shown that sildenafil is selective for phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Its effect is more potent on PDE5 than on other known phosphodiesterases [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. In particular, there is a 10-times selectivity over PDE6 which is involved in the phototransduction pathway in the retina [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. There is an 80-times selectivity over PDE1, and over 700-times over PDE 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. And finally, sildenafil has greater than 4,000-times selectivity for PDE5 over PDE3, the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase isoform involved in the control of cardiac contractility [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



In eight double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies of patients with either organic or psychogenic erectile dysfunction, sexual stimulation resulted in improved erections, as assessed by an objective measurement of hardness and duration of erections (via the use of RigiScan®), after sildenafil administration compared with placebo [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Most studies assessed the efficacy of sildenafil approximately 60 minutes post-dose [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The erectile response, as assessed by RigiScan®, generally increased with increasing sildenafil dose and plasma concentration [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The time course of effect was examined in one study, showing an effect for up to 4 hours but the response was diminished compared to 2 hours [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



Sildenafil causes mild and transient decreases in systemic blood pressure which, in the majority of cases, do not translate into clinical effects [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg, three times a day to patients with systemic hypertension the mean change from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was a decrease of 9.4 mmHg and 9.1 mmHg respectively [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg, three times a day to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension lesser effects in blood pressure reduction were observed (a reduction in both systolic and diastolic pressure of 2 mmHg)[F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614] . At the recommended dose of 20 mg three times a day no reductions in systolic or diastolic pressure were seen [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



Single oral doses of sildenafil up to 100 mg in healthy volunteers produced no clinically relevant effects on ECG [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg three times a day to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension no clinically relevant effects on the ECG were reported either [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



In a study of the hemodynamic effects of a single oral 100 mg dose of sildenafil in 14 patients with severe coronary artery disease (CAD) (> 70 % stenosis of at least one coronary artery), the mean resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased by 7 % and 6 % respectively compared to baseline [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Mean pulmonary systolic blood pressure decreased by 9% [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Sildenafil showed no effect on cardiac output and did not impair blood flow through the stenosed coronary arteries [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



Mild and transient differences in color discrimination (blue/green) were detected in some subjects using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test at 1 hour following a 100 mg dose, with no effects evident after 2 hours post-dose [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The postulated mechanism for this change in color discrimination is related to inhibition of PDE6, which is involved in the phototransduction cascade of the retina [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Sildenafil has no effect on visual acuity or contrast sensitivity. In a small size placebo-controlled study of patients with documented early age-related macular degeneration (n = 9), sildenafil (single dose, 100 mg) demonstrated no significant changes in visual tests conducted (which included visual acuity, Amsler grid, color discrimination simulated traffic light, and the Humphrey perimeter and photostress test) [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Tramadol has also been shown to affect a number of pain modulators including alpha2-adrenoreceptors, neurokinin 1 receptors, the voltage-gated sodium channel type II alpha subunit[A183728], transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1 - also known as the capsaicin receptor)[A183734], muscarinic receptors (M1 and M3), N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (also known as the NMDA receptor or glutamate receptor)[A17158], Adenosine A1 receptors[A183761], and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.[A17159] 



In addition to the above neuronal targets, tramadol has a number of effects on inflammatory and immune mediators involved in the pain response. This includes inhibitory effects on cytokines, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), nuclear factor-κB, and glial cells as well as a change in the polarization state of M1 macrophages.[A182300]', 'Tramadol modulates the descending pain pathways within the central nervous system through the binding of parent and M1 metabolite to μ-opioid receptors and the weak inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.[A173983,A173980] 



Apart from analgesia, tramadol may produce a constellation of symptoms (including dizziness, somnolence, nausea, constipation, sweating and pruritus) similar to that of other opioids. 



**Central Nervous System**



In contrast to [morphine], tramadol has not been shown to cause histamine release. At therapeutic doses, tramadol has no effect on heart rate, left-ventricular function or cardiac index. Orthostatic hypotension has been observed.[L9257]



Tramadol produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centres. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem centres to increases in CO2 tension and to electrical stimulation. 



Tramadol depresses the cough reflex by a direct effect on the cough centre in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia.



Tramadol causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but

are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce

similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of

oxycodone overdose.[F4679]



Seizures have been reported in patients receiving tramadol within the recommended dosage range. Spontaneous post-marketing reports indicate that seizure risk is increased with doses of tramadol above the recommended range. Risk of convulsions may also increase in patients with epilepsy, those with a history of seizures

or in patients with a recognized risk for seizure (such as head trauma, metabolic disorders,

alcohol and drug withdrawal, CNS infections), or with concomitant use of other drugs known to reduce the seizure threshold.[F4679]



Tramadol can cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs (e.g., anti-depressants, migraine medications). Treatment with the serotoninergic drug should be discontinued if such events (characterized by clusters of symptoms such as hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs, mental status changes including confusion, irritability, extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma) occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated. Tramadol should not be used in combination with MAO inhibitors or serotonin-precursors (such as L-tryptophan, oxitriptan) and should be used with caution in combination with other serotonergic drugs (triptans, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lithium, St. John’s Wort) due to the risk of serotonin syndrome.[F4679]



**Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle**



Tramadol causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.[F4679]



**Endocrine System**



Opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal or -gonadal axes. Some changes that can be seen include an increase in serum prolactin and decreases in plasma cortisol and testosterone. Clinical signs and symptoms may be manifest from these hormonal changes.[F4679]



Hyponatremia has been reported very rarely with the use of tramadol, usually in patients with predisposing risk factors, such as elderly patients and/or patients using concomitant medications that may cause hyponatremia (e.g., antidepressants, benzodiazepines, diuretics). In some reports, hyponatremia appeared to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) and resolved with discontinuation of tramadol and appropriate treatment (e.g., fluid restriction). During tramadol treatment, monitoring for signs and symptoms of hyponatremia is recommended for patients with predisposing risk factors.[F4679]



**Cardiovascular**



Tramadol administration may result in severe hypotension in patients whose ability to maintain adequate blood pressure is compromised by reduced blood volume, or concurrent administration of drugs such as phenothiazines and other tranquillizers, sedative/hypnotics, tricyclic antidepressants or general anesthetics. These patients should be monitored for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of tramadol.[F4679]



**QTc-Interval Prolongation**



The maximum placebo-adjusted mean change from baseline in the QTcF interval was 5.5 ms in the 400 mg/day treatment arm and 6.5 ms in the 600 mg/day mg treatment arm, both occurring at the 8h time point. Both treatment groups were within the 10 ms threshold for QT prolongation. Post-marketing experience with the use of tramadol containing products included rare reports of QT prolongation reported with an overdose. Particular care should be exercised when administering tramadol to patients who are suspected to be at an increased risk of experiencing torsade de pointes during treatment with a QTc-prolonging drug.[F4679]



**Abuse and Misuse**



Like all opioids, tramadol has the potential for abuse and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Therefore, tramadol should be prescribed and handled with caution.[F4679]



**Dependence/Tolerance**



Physical dependence and tolerance reflect the neuroadaptation of the opioid receptors to chronic exposure to an opioid and are separate and distinct from abuse and addiction. Tolerance, as well as physical dependence, may develop upon repeated administration of opioids, and are not by themselves evidence of an addictive disorder or abuse. Patients on prolonged therapy should be tapered gradually from the drug if it is no longer required for pain control. Withdrawal symptoms may occur following abrupt discontinuation of therapy or upon administration of an opioid antagonist. Some of the symptoms that may be associated with abrupt withdrawal of an opioid analgesic include body aches, diarrhea, gooseflesh, loss of appetite, nausea, nervousness or restlessness, anxiety, runny nose, sneezing, tremors or shivering, stomach cramps, tachycardia, trouble with sleeping, unusual increase in sweating, palpitations, unexplained fever, weakness and yawning.[F4679]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

', '**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].



Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].



In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].



There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].



Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].



The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. 



In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].



In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].



The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].', 'Zinc is involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of human proteins may bind zinc, in addition to hundreds of proteins that transport and traffic zinc. It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is an essential element for a proper sense of taste and smell and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations [L2211].



Studies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions [L2095]:



**Colds:** Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently [L2095].



**Wound healing:** Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements [L2095]. 



**Diahrrea**: Oral zinc supplements can reduce the symptoms of diarrhea in children with low levels of zinc, especially in cases of malnutrition [L2095].

Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]', 'Rosuvastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A181421] Rosuvastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which increases hepatic uptake of LDL. Rosuvastatin also inhibits hepatic synthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL).[F4649] The overall effect is a decrease in plasma LDL and VLDL. 



In vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that rosuvastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] This includes improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response.



Statins have also been found to bind allosterically to β2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and in T cell activation.[A181559]



Rosuvastatin exerts an anti-inflammatory effect on rat mesenteric microvascular endothelium by attenuating leukocyte rolling, adherence and transmigration.[A1807] The drug also modulates nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression and reduces ischemic-reperfusion injuries in rat hearts.[A1787] Rosuvastatin increases the bioavailability of nitric oxide[A1807,A1799,A1787] by upregulating NOS[A1791] and by increasing the stability of NOS through post-transcriptional polyadenylation.[A1796] It is unclear as to how rosuvastatin brings about these effects though they may be due to decreased concentrations of mevalonic acid.', 'Rosuvastatin is a synthetic, enantiomerically pure antilipemic agent. It is used to lower total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and trigleride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, rosuvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A181087, A181406]



Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]



**Skeletal Muscle Effects**



Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. These risks can occur at any dose level, but are increased at the highest dose (40 mg). Rosuvastatin should be prescribed with caution in patients with predisposing factors for myopathy (e.g., age ≥ 65 years, inadequately treated hypothyroidism, renal impairment).



The risk of myopathy during treatment with rosuvastatin may be increased with concurrent administration of some other lipid-lowering therapies (such as [fenofibrate] or [niacin]), [gemfibrozil], [cyclosporine], [atazanavir]/[ritonavir], [lopinavir]/ritonavir, or [simeprevir].  Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin, coadministered with [colchicine], and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together.[F4649] 



Real-world data from observational studies has suggested that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]



**Liver Enzyme Abnormalities**



Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. In most cases, the elevations were transient and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. There were two cases of jaundice, for which a relationship to rosuvastatin therapy could not be determined, which resolved after discontinuation of therapy. There were no cases of liver failure or irreversible liver disease in these trials.[F4649]



**Endocrine Effects**



Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin calcium tablets. Based on clinical trial data with rosuvastatin, in some instances these increases may exceed the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.[F4649]



An in vitro study found that [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], and [pitavastatin] exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on human pancreas islet β cells, with reductions in cell viability of 32, 41, 34 and 29%, respectively, versus control]. Moreover, insulin secretion rates were decreased by 34, 30, 27 and 19%, respectively, relative to control.[A182012]



HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and lower cholesterol levels and, as such, might theoretically blunt adrenal or gonadal steroid hormone production. Rosuvastatin demonstrated no effect upon nonstimulated cortisol levels and no effect on thyroid metabolism as assessed by TSH plasma concentration. In rosuvastatin treated patients, there was no impairment of adrenocortical reserve and no reduction in plasma cortisol concentrations. Clinical studies with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have suggested that these agents do not reduce plasma testosterone concentration. The effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on male fertility have not been studied. The effects, if any, on the pituitarygonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown.[F4652]



**Cardiovascular**



Ubiquinone levels were not measured in rosuvastatin clinical trials, however significant decreases in circulating ubiquinone levels in patients treated with other statins have been observed. The clinical significance of a potential long-term statin-induced deficiency of ubiquinone has not been established. It has been reported that a decrease in myocardial ubiquinone levels could lead to impaired cardiac function in patients with borderline congestive heart failure.[F4652]



**Lipoprotein A**



In some patients, the beneficial effect of lowered total cholesterol and LDL-C levels may be partly blunted by a concomitant increase in the Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentrations. Present knowledge suggests the importance of high Lp(a) levels as an emerging risk factor for coronary heart disease. It is thus desirable to maintain and reinforce lifestyle changes in high-risk patients placed on rosuvastatin therapy.[F4652] Further studies have demonstrated statins affect Lp(a) levels differently in patients with dyslipidemia depending on their apo(a) phenotype; statins increase Lp(a) levels exclusively in patients with the low molecular weight apo(a) phenotype.[A181418]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Experimental evidence indicates that serotonin (5-HT), throughout brain descending pathways, exerts an inhibitory role on ejaculation.

Clotrimazole causes inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis, an essential constituent of fungal cell membranes. If ergosterol synthesis is either completely or partially inhibited, the cell is no longer able to construct an intact and functional cell membrane [F3088],[F3100]. Because ergosterol directly promotes the growth of fungal cells in a hormone‐like fashion, rapid onset of the above events leads to dose-dependent inhibition of fungal growth [A174094].



Though decreased ergosterol, due to the inhibition of lanosterol 14-demethylase (also known as _CYP51_) [A174094] is accepted to be primarily responsible for the antimycotic properties of clotrimazole, this drug also shows other pharmacological effects. These include the inhibition of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+‐ATPase,  depletion of intracellular calcium, and blocking of calcium‐dependent potassium channels and voltage‐dependent calcium channels [A174094]. The action of clotrimazole on these targets accounts for other effects of this drug that are separate from its antimycotic activities [A174094].', 'Clotrimazole is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent that inhibits the growth of pathogenic yeasts by changing the permeability of cell membranes.

Unfortunately, resistance to clotrimazole, which was rare in the past, is now common in various patient populations [A174094]. 



Clotrimazole is generally considered to be a fungistatic, and not a fungicidal drug, although this contrast is not absolute, as clotrimazole shows fungicidal properties at higher concentrations [A174094].

A deficiency in iron indicates that the body cannot produce enough normal red blood cells.[A32514,L11800] Iron deficiency anemia occurs when body stores of iron decrease to very low levels, and the stored iron is insufficient to support normal red blood cell (RBC) production. Insufficient dietary iron, impaired iron absorption, bleeding, pregnancy, or loss of iron through the urine can lead to iron deficiency.[A32514,L11794]  Symptoms of iron deficiency anemia include fatigue, breathlessness, palpitations, dizziness, and headache.



Taking iron in supplement form, such as ferrous sulfate, allows for more rapid increases in iron levels when dietary supply and stores are not sufficient.[L2175] Iron is transported by the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) across the endolysosomal membrane to enter the macrophage. It can then can be incorporated into ferritin and be stored in the macrophage or carried of the macrophage by ferroportin. This exported iron is  oxidized by the enzyme to ceruloplasmin to Fe3+, followed by sequestration by transferrin for transport in the serum to various sites, including the bone marrow for hemoglobin synthesis or into the liver.[A32524] Iron combines with porphyrin and globin chains to form hemoglobin, which is critical for oxygen delivery from the lungs to other tissues.[L2263]', 'Ferrous sulfate replenishes iron, an essential component in hemoglobin, myoglobin, and various enzymes.

The Health Canada monograph for rosuvastatin further specifies that rosuvastatin is indicated for the reduction of elevated total cholesterol (Total-C), LDL-C, ApoB, the Total-C/HDL-C ratio and triglycerides (TG) and for increasing HDL-C in hyperlipidemic and dyslipidemic conditions when response to diet and exercise alone has been inadequate. It is also indicated for the prevention of major cardiovascular events (including risk of myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and coronary artery revascularization) in adult patients without documented history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events, but with at least two conventional risk factors for cardiovascular disease.[F4652]



Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]', 'Rosuvastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A181421] Rosuvastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which increases hepatic uptake of LDL. Rosuvastatin also inhibits hepatic synthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL).[F4649] The overall effect is a decrease in plasma LDL and VLDL. 



In vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that rosuvastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] This includes improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response.



Statins have also been found to bind allosterically to β2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and in T cell activation.[A181559]



Rosuvastatin exerts an anti-inflammatory effect on rat mesenteric microvascular endothelium by attenuating leukocyte rolling, adherence and transmigration.[A1807] The drug also modulates nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression and reduces ischemic-reperfusion injuries in rat hearts.[A1787] Rosuvastatin increases the bioavailability of nitric oxide[A1807,A1799,A1787] by upregulating NOS[A1791] and by increasing the stability of NOS through post-transcriptional polyadenylation.[A1796] It is unclear as to how rosuvastatin brings about these effects though they may be due to decreased concentrations of mevalonic acid.', 'Rosuvastatin is a synthetic, enantiomerically pure antilipemic agent. It is used to lower total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and trigleride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, rosuvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A181087, A181406]



Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]



**Skeletal Muscle Effects**



Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. These risks can occur at any dose level, but are increased at the highest dose (40 mg). Rosuvastatin should be prescribed with caution in patients with predisposing factors for myopathy (e.g., age ≥ 65 years, inadequately treated hypothyroidism, renal impairment).



The risk of myopathy during treatment with rosuvastatin may be increased with concurrent administration of some other lipid-lowering therapies (such as [fenofibrate] or [niacin]), [gemfibrozil], [cyclosporine], [atazanavir]/[ritonavir], [lopinavir]/ritonavir, or [simeprevir].  Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin, coadministered with [colchicine], and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together.[F4649] 



Real-world data from observational studies has suggested that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]



**Liver Enzyme Abnormalities**



Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. In most cases, the elevations were transient and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. There were two cases of jaundice, for which a relationship to rosuvastatin therapy could not be determined, which resolved after discontinuation of therapy. There were no cases of liver failure or irreversible liver disease in these trials.[F4649]



**Endocrine Effects**



Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin calcium tablets. Based on clinical trial data with rosuvastatin, in some instances these increases may exceed the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.[F4649]



An in vitro study found that [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], and [pitavastatin] exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on human pancreas islet β cells, with reductions in cell viability of 32, 41, 34 and 29%, respectively, versus control]. Moreover, insulin secretion rates were decreased by 34, 30, 27 and 19%, respectively, relative to control.[A182012]



HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and lower cholesterol levels and, as such, might theoretically blunt adrenal or gonadal steroid hormone production. Rosuvastatin demonstrated no effect upon nonstimulated cortisol levels and no effect on thyroid metabolism as assessed by TSH plasma concentration. In rosuvastatin treated patients, there was no impairment of adrenocortical reserve and no reduction in plasma cortisol concentrations. Clinical studies with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have suggested that these agents do not reduce plasma testosterone concentration. The effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on male fertility have not been studied. The effects, if any, on the pituitarygonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown.[F4652]



**Cardiovascular**



Ubiquinone levels were not measured in rosuvastatin clinical trials, however significant decreases in circulating ubiquinone levels in patients treated with other statins have been observed. The clinical significance of a potential long-term statin-induced deficiency of ubiquinone has not been established. It has been reported that a decrease in myocardial ubiquinone levels could lead to impaired cardiac function in patients with borderline congestive heart failure.[F4652]



**Lipoprotein A**



In some patients, the beneficial effect of lowered total cholesterol and LDL-C levels may be partly blunted by a concomitant increase in the Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentrations. Present knowledge suggests the importance of high Lp(a) levels as an emerging risk factor for coronary heart disease. It is thus desirable to maintain and reinforce lifestyle changes in high-risk patients placed on rosuvastatin therapy.[F4652] Further studies have demonstrated statins affect Lp(a) levels differently in patients with dyslipidemia depending on their apo(a) phenotype; statins increase Lp(a) levels exclusively in patients with the low molecular weight apo(a) phenotype.[A181418]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Phenytoin is often described as a non-specific sodium channel blocker and targets almost all voltage-gated sodium channel subtypes.[A188826] More specifically, phenytoin prevents seizures by inhibiting the positive feedback loop that results in neuronal propagation of high frequency action potentials.[A188772,A189219,A189273]

The rate of removal of phosphate by dietary manipulation or by dialysis is insufficient. Dialysis patients absorb 40% to 80% of dietary phosphorus. Therefore, the fraction of dietary phosphate absorbed from the diet needs to be reduced by using phosphate binders in most renal failure patients on maintenance dialysis. Calcium acetate when taken with meals combines with dietary phosphate to form insoluble calcium phosphate which is excreted in the feces.

It is a very common over-the-counter medication widely used as an analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic.[A39096]



The use of ibuprofen and its enantiomer [DB09213] in a racemic mix is common for the management of mild to moderate pain related to dysmenorrhea, headache, migraine, postoperative dental pain, spondylitis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and soft tissue disorder.[A39097]



Due to its activity against prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis, ibuprofen has been attributed to alteration of platelet function and prolongation of gestation and labour.[A39092]



As ibuprofen is a widely used medication, the main therapeutic indications are:



* Patent Ductus Arteriosus - it is a neonatal condition wherein the ductus arteriosus (blood vessel that connects the main pulmonary artery to the proximal descending aorta) fails to close after birth causing severe risk of heart failure. The prostaglandin inhibition of ibuprofen has been studied for the treatment of this condition as it is known that prostaglandin E2 is responsible for keeping the ductus arteriosus open.[A39100]



* Rheumatoid- and osteo-arthritis - ibuprofen is very commonly used in the symptomatic treatment of inflammatory, musculoskeletal and rheumatic disorders.[A39176]



* Cystic fibrosis - the use of high dosages of ibuprofen has been proven to decrease inflammation and decreasing polymorphonuclear cell influx in the lungs.[A39177]



* Orthostatic hypotension - ibuprofen can induce sodium retention and antagonize the effect of diuretics which has been reported to be beneficial for patients with severe orthostatic hypotension.[A1651]



* Dental pain - ibuprofen is used to manage acute and chronic orofacial pain.[A10901]



* Pain - ibuprofen is widely used to reduce minor aches and pains as well as to reduce fever and manage dysmenorrhea. It is very commonly used for the relief of acute indications such as fever and tension headaches.[A39092] It is also used to manage mild to moderate pain and moderate to severe pain as an adjunct to opioid analgesics.[L40208]



* Investigational uses - efforts have been put into developing ibuprofen for the prophylaxis of Alzheimer''s disease, Parkinson disease, and breast cancer.[A39092]', 'The exact mechanism of action of ibuprofen is unknown. However, ibuprofen is considered an NSAID and thus it is a non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, which is an enzyme involved in prostaglandin (mediators of pain and fever) and thromboxane (stimulators of blood clotting) synthesis via the arachidonic acid pathway.[L4614]



Ibuprofen is a non-selective COX inhibitor and hence, it inhibits the activity of both COX-1 and COX-2. The inhibition of COX-2 activity decreases the synthesis of prostaglandins involved in mediating inflammation, pain, fever, and swelling while the inhibition of COX-1 is thought to cause some of the side effects of ibuprofen including GI ulceration.[A39195]', 'Ibuprofen has multiple actions in different inflammatory pathways involved in acute and chronic inflammation. The main effects reported in ibuprofen are related to the control of pain, fever and acute inflammation by the inhibition of the synthesis of prostanoids by COX-1 and COX-2. Pain relief is attributed to peripheral affected regions and central nervous system effects in the pain transmission mediated by the dorsal horn and higher spinothalamic tract. Some reports have tried to link the pain regulation with a possible enhancement on the synthesis of endogenous cannabinoids and action on the NMDA receptors. The effect on pain has been shown to be related to the cortically evoked potentials.[A39190]



The antipyretic effect is reported to be linked to the effect on the prostanoid synthesis due to the fact that the prostanoids are the main signaling mediator of pyresis in the hypothalamic-preoptic region.[A39190]



The use of ibuprofen in dental procedures is attributed to the local inhibition of prostanoid production as well as to anti-oedemic activity and an increase of plasma beta-endorphins. Some reports have suggested a rapid local reduction of the expression of COX-2 in dental pulp derived by the administration of ibuprofen.[A39190]



The administration of ibuprofen in patients with rheumatic diseases has shown to control joint symptoms.[A39092] 



Ibuprofen is largely used in OTC products such as an agent for the management of dysmenorrhea which has been proven to reduce the amount of menstrual prostanoids and to produce a reduction in the uterine hypercontractility.[A39181] As well, it has been reported to reduce significantly the fever and the pain caused by migraines.[A39182, A39183] This effect is thought to be related to the effect on platelet activation and thromboxane A2 production which produces local vascular effects in the affected regions. This effect is viable as ibuprofen can enter in the central nervous system.[A39190]



In the investigational uses of ibuprofen, it has been reported to reduce neurodegeneration when given in low doses over a long time.[A39184] On the other hand, its use in Parkinson disease is related to the importance of inflammation and oxidative stress in the pathology of this condition.[A39185] The use of ibuprofen for breast cancer is related to a study that shows a decrease of 50% in the rate of breast cancer.[A39186]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

A deficiency in iron indicates that the body cannot produce enough normal red blood cells.[A32514,L11800] Iron deficiency anemia occurs when body stores of iron decrease to very low levels, and the stored iron is insufficient to support normal red blood cell (RBC) production. Insufficient dietary iron, impaired iron absorption, bleeding, pregnancy, or loss of iron through the urine can lead to iron deficiency.[A32514,L11794]  Symptoms of iron deficiency anemia include fatigue, breathlessness, palpitations, dizziness, and headache.



Taking iron in supplement form, such as ferrous sulfate, allows for more rapid increases in iron levels when dietary supply and stores are not sufficient.[L2175] Iron is transported by the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) across the endolysosomal membrane to enter the macrophage. It can then can be incorporated into ferritin and be stored in the macrophage or carried of the macrophage by ferroportin. This exported iron is  oxidized by the enzyme to ceruloplasmin to Fe3+, followed by sequestration by transferrin for transport in the serum to various sites, including the bone marrow for hemoglobin synthesis or into the liver.[A32524] Iron combines with porphyrin and globin chains to form hemoglobin, which is critical for oxygen delivery from the lungs to other tissues.[L2263]', 'Ferrous sulfate replenishes iron, an essential component in hemoglobin, myoglobin, and various enzymes. It replaces the iron that is usually found in hemoglobin and myoglobin. Iron participates in oxygen transport and storage, electron transport and energy metabolism, antioxidant and beneficial pro-oxidant functions, oxygen sensing, tissue proliferation and growth, as well as DNA replication and repair.[A32524,A32514]

', '**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].



Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].



In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].



There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].



Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].



The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. 



In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].



In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].



The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].', 'Zinc is involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of human proteins may bind zinc, in addition to hundreds of proteins that transport and traffic zinc. It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is an essential element for a proper sense of taste and smell and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations [L2211].



Studies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions [L2095]:



**Colds:** Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently [L2095].



**Wound healing:** Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements [L2095]. 



**Diahrrea**: Oral zinc supplements can reduce the symptoms of diarrhea in children with low levels of zinc, especially in cases of malnutrition [L2095].

Hyaluronic acid works by two basic mechanisms: serving as a passive structural molecule or serving as signaling molecule, depending on the molecule size. The physicochemical properties of high molecular weight HA contribute to passive structural effects, demonstrating hygroscopicity and viscoelasticity and improving hydration, water balance, and structural integrity. As a signalling  molecule interacting with proteins, HA causes several opposing effects based on molecular weight: pro- or anti-inflammatory effects, promotion or inhibition of cell migration, and activating or inhibiting cell division.[A230133] 



Hyaluronic acid exerts its therapeutic effects through binding to three primary types of cell surface receptors: CD44 (a membrane glycoprotein), the receptor for hyaluronate-mediated motility (RHAMM), and the Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1). CD44 is considered the most widely distributed receptor for hyaluronic acid, demonstrating cellular interactions with osteopontin, collagen, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).  High and low molecular weight hyaluronic acids demonstrate differing molecular and cellular mechanisms in their interaction with CD44 receptors. Some examples of these effects include modification of chondrocyte survival pathways in addition to alteration of apoptosis pathways.  Lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor (LYVE-1), and hyaluronic acid receptor for endocytosis (HARE), (also known as Stabilin-2) also bind to hyaluronic acid.[A230128] 



Hyaluronic acid for skin conditions and cosmetics



Hyaluronic acid''s anionic proprieties cause it to attract water and induce swelling, increasing tissue volume and skin structural integrity. The aging process is associated with reduced production of skin hyaluronic acid and collagen, causing the appearance of wrinkles and the loss of facial volume. Dermal fillers of hyaluronic acid replace lost tissue volume, imparting a full and youthful appearance to skin that has lost its elasticity. Hyaluronic acid fillers contain cross-linked hyaluronic acid particles, rendering a concentrated substance with resistance to various forms of physical and chemical breakdown. The cosmetic benefits of hyaluronic acid filler may last up to 6 months, depending on the brand and technique used for injection.[L32193] Additionally, dermal hyaluronic acid fillers are known to increase the production of fibroblasts[L32193], supporting wound healing and offering relief from irritating and inflammatory skin conditions.[A230118]





Hyaluronic acid for joint pain



Most cells in the human body are capable of synthesizing HA. It is a primary component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and can be found in bone marrow, cartilage, and synovial fluid in joints.[A230128] In osteoarthritis, the concentration of naturally occurring hyaluronic acid gradually decreases, lowering the viscosity of synovial fluid that protects joints from excess friction. Administration of intra-articular hyaluronic acid increases viscosity of synovial joint fluid, reducing friction and subsequently relieving painful arthritic symptoms.[L32193]





Hyaluronic acid for ophthalmic conditions and ophthalmological procedures



Solutions of hyaluronic acid with a concentration greater than 0.1% moisturize the surface of the eyes to treat symptoms of dry eye while improving the stabilization of tear film, replenishing deficiencies of HA, reducing friction, and preventing binding of foreign substances to the ocular tissue.[A230128,L32193] Hyaluronic acid is frequently used during and after ophthalmological surgeries and plays important roles by virtue of its moisturizing, viscoelastic, and protective properties. It promotes tissue healing of the corneal epithelium and other parts of the eye following ophthalmological surgery, minimizing the risk of adhesions and free radical formation.[A230128]

', 'HA has long-acting lubricant, shock absorbing, joint stabilizing, and water balancing properties.[A230128,L32193] It is similar to the naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan (GAG) in joints. Hyaluronic acid works by acting as a lubricant and shock absorber, facilitating joint mobility and thereby reducing osteoarthritic pain.  Hyaluronic acid has antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic effects.[A230128] The water-balancing properties and viscoelasticity of hyaluronic acid are beneficial in cosmetic injections, imparting volume and reducing the appearance of imperfections and wrinkles.[L32193] Due to the abovementioned properties, HA has a protective effect on the eyes and cornea.[A230133]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Many of these RTKs are implicated in lung fibrosis and tumour angiogenesis, so nintedanib is therefore used in the treatment of proliferative diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, non-small cell lung cancer, and systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease.[L8453,L8459] The specific RTKs that nintedanib inhibits are platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFR) α and β, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1-3, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 1-3, and Fns-Like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3).[L8453,L8459,A185123] Nintedanib binds to the ATP-binding pocket of these receptors and inhibits their activity, thereby blocking signalling cascades that result in the proliferation and migration of lung fibroblasts. Nintedanib also inhibits kinase signalling pathways in various cells within tumour tissues, including endothelial cells, pericytes, smooth muscle cells, and cells contributing to angiogenesis, culminating in an inhibition of cell proliferation and apoptosis of affected tumour cells.[A185123]



In addition to RTK inhibition, nintedanib also prevents the actions of the nRTKs Lck, Lyn, and Src.[L8453,L8459,A185123] The contribution of the inhibition of Lck and Lyn towards the therapeutic efficacy of nintedanib is unclear, but inhibition of the Src pathway by nintedanib has been shown to reduce lung fibrosis.[A185123,A185249]', 'Nintedanib is a small molecule kinase inhibitor that inhibits upstream kinase activity to ultimately inhibit lung fibroblast proliferation and migration, as well as signalling pathways that promote the proliferation and survival of endothelial and perivascular cells in tumour tissues.[L8453,L8459,A185123]

Intravenous indometacin is indicated to induce closure of a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants weighing between 500 and 1750 g when after 48 hours usual medical management (e.g., fluid restriction, diuretics, digitalis, respiratory support, etc.) is ineffective.[L10553]', 'Indometacin is a nonspecific and reversible inhibitor of the cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzyme or prostaglandin G/H synthase. There are two identified isoforms of COX: COX-1 is universally present in most body tissues and is involved in the synthesis of the prostaglandins and thromboxane A2, while COX-2 is expressed in response to injury or inflammation.[A177871] Constitutively expressed, the COX-1 enzyme is involved in gastric mucosal protection, platelet, and kidney function by catalyzing the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin (PG) G2 and PGG2 to PGH2.[A177871] COX-2 is constitutively expressed and highly inducible by inflammatory stimuli. It is found in the central nervous system, kidneys, uterus, and other organs. COX-2 also catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to PGG2 and PGG2 to PGH2. In the COX-2-mediated pathway, PGH2 is further converted to PGE2 and PGI2 (also known as prostacyclin). PGE2 is involved in mediating inflammation, pain, and fever. Decreasing levels of PGE2 leads to reduced inflammatory reactions. Indometacin is known to inhibit both isoforms of COX, however, with greater selectivity for COX-1, which accounts for its increased adverse gastric effects relative to other NSAIDs. It binds to the enzyme''s active site and prevents the interaction between the enzyme and its substrate, arachidonic acid. Indometacin, unlike other NSAIDs, also inhibits phospholipase A2, the enzyme responsible for releasing arachidonic acid from phospholipids. The analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects of indomethacin as well as adverse reactions associated with the drug occur as a result of decreased prostaglandin synthesis. Its antipyretic effects may be due to action on the hypothalamus, resulting in increased peripheral blood flow, vasodilation, and subsequent heat dissipation.



The exact mechanism of action of indometacin in inducing closure of a patent ductus arteriosus is not fully understood; however, it is thought to be through inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.[L6778] At birth, the ductus arteriosus is normally closed as the tension of the oxygen increases significantly after birth.[A177880] Patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants is associated with congenital heart malformations where PGE1 mediates an opposite effect to that of oxygen. PGE1 dilates the ductus arteriosus through smooth muscle relaxation and prevents the closure of the ductus arteriosus.[A177880] By inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins, indometacin promotes the closure of ductus arteriosus.[L10553]



Indometacin has been described as possessing anticancer and antiviral properties through activation of protein kinase R (PKR) and downstream phosphorylation of eIF2α, inhibiting protein synthesis.[A234429, A234434]', 'Indometacin is an NSAID with analgesic and antipyretic properties that exerts its pharmacological effects by inhibiting the synthesis of factors involved in pain, fever, and inflammation. Its therapeutic action does not involve pituitary-adrenal stimulation.[L6778] Indometacin primarily works by suppressing inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis by providing relief of pain as well as reducing fever, swelling, and tenderness. This effectiveness has been demonstrated by a reduction in the extent of joint swelling, the average number of joints displaying symptoms of inflammation, and the severity of morning stiffness. Increased mobility was demonstrated by a decrease in total walking time and by improved functional capability seen as an increase in grip strength.[L6778] In clinical trials, indometacin was shown to be effective in relieving the pain, reducing the fever, swelling, redness, and tenderness of acute gouty arthritis. Due to its pharmacological actions, the use of indometacin is associated with the risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, as well as gastrointestinal effects such as bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines.[L6778]

By doing so, it inhibits acid secretion into the gsatric lumen. This effect is dose-related and leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus.



Esomeprazole is the s-isomer of [DB00338], which is a racemate of the S- and R-enantiomer. Esomeprazole has been shown to inhibit acid secretion to a similar extent as [DB00338], without any significant differences between the two compounds _in vitro_. 



PPIs such as esomeprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]



Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as esomeprazole has been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

The classical interpretation of PTX''s broad effects is due to its ability to act, _in vitro_, as a non-specific cyclic-3'',5''-phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor at millimolar concentrations; specifically, it has been proposed that inhibition of PDE type III and IV isozymes leads to elevated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which mediate diverse downstream effects.[A226420, A226425, A226430] This view has been challenged, specifically by observing those plasma concentrations of PTX in routine clinical use are typically only around 1μM, far lower than those used to inhibit PDEs _in vitro_.[A226430] Instead, several studies have suggested that PTX can modulate adenosine receptor function, specifically the Gα-coupled A2A receptor (A2AR). Whether PTX acts directly as an A2AR agonist is unclear, although it can clearly increase the response of A2AR to adenosine.[A16840, A16821, A226350, A226435] A2AR activation activates adenylyl cyclase, which increases intracellular cAMP levels; this observation may explain PTX''s ability to increase intracellular cAMP in a PDE-independent fashion.[A226440]



Elevated cAMP levels have numerous downstream effects. cAMP-mediated activation of protein kinase A (PKA) suppresses nuclear translocation of NF-κB, which suppresses transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and IL-6 as well as TNF-induced molecules such as adhesion molecules (ICAM1 and VCAM1) and the C-reactive protein (CRP).[A226415, A226445, A226450, A226455] PTX has also been shown to prevent the downstream phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK, which are responsible for assembling the NADPH oxidase involved in the neutrophil oxidative burst. This effect is due to a PKA-independent decrease in Akt phosphorylation and a PKA-dependent decrease in phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK.[A226450, A226465, A226470] This transcriptional regulation at least partially explains the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties of PTX.



Also, activated PKA can activate the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which itself blocks SMAD-driven gene transcription, effectively disrupting transforming growth factor (TGF-β1) signalling.[A226440, A226475] This results in lower levels of fibrinogenic molecules such as collagens, fibronectin, connective tissue growth factor, and alpha-smooth muscle actin.[A226440, A226450, A226475, A226460] Hence, disruption of TGF-β1 signalling may explain the anti-fibrotic effects of PTX, including at least some of the decrease in blood viscosity.



The picture is complicated by the observation that PTX metabolites M1, M4, and M5 have been shown to inhibit C5 Des Arg- and formyl-methionylleucylphenylalanine-induced superoxide production in neutrophils and M1 and M5 significantly contribute to PTX''s observed hemorheological effects.[A226415, A226430, A226480] Overall, PTX administration is associated with decreased pro-inflammatory molecules, an increase in anti-inflammatory molecules such as IL-10, and decreased production of fibrinogenic and cellular adhesion molecules.', 'Pentoxifylline, a synthetic dimethylxanthine derivative structurally related to [theophylline] and [caffeine], exhibits hemorheological, anti-oxidative, and anti-inflammatory properties and is traditionally indicated in the treatment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD).

Concurrent use with [warfarin] should be associated with more frequent monitoring of prothrombin times.

Current knowledge suggests that levetiracetam’s binding to synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) is a key driver of its action. SV2A is a membrane-bound protein that is found on synaptic vesicles and is ubiquitous throughout the CNS[A12546] - it appears to play a role in vesicle exocytosis[L8606,L8615] and in the modulation of synaptic transmission by increasing the available amount of secretory vesicles available for neurotransmission.[A12552] Stimulation of pre-synaptic SV2A by levetiracetam may inhibit neurotransmitter release,[A12551] but this action does not appear to affect normal neurotransmission. This has led to the suggestion that levetiracetam exclusively modulates the function of SV2A only under pathophysiological conditions.[A12546] Levetiracetam and related analogues showed a correlation between affinity for SV2A and anti-epileptic potency, further suggesting that action at this site contributes to the anti-epileptic activity of the drug.[L8606,L8615]



Levetiracetam has also been shown to indirectly affect GABAergic neurotransmission (despite having no direct effect on GABAergic or glutamatergic receptors) and modulate ionic currents.[A12552] Similarly, levetiracetam has been shown in vitro to inhibit N-type calcium channels.[A16562] How, or even if, these actions are implicated in its anti-epileptic action have yet to be elucidated.', 'Levetiracetam appears to prevent seizure activity via the selective inhibition of hypersynchronized epileptiform burst firing without affecting normal neuronal transmission, though the exact mechanism through which this occurs is unclear.[L8606,L8615] The therapeutic index of levetiracetam is wide,[L8615,A185918] making it relatively unique amongst other anti-epileptic medications.

DNA gyrase is an enzyme found only in bacteria that introduces negative supercoils into DNA during replication - this helps to relieve torsional strain caused by the introduction of positive supercoils during replication, and these negative supercoils are essential for chromosome condensation and the promotion of transcription initiation.[A31453] It is comprised of four subunits (two A subunits and two B subunits) of which the A subunits appear to be the target of fluoroquinolone antibiotics.[A190663] Bacterial topoisomerase IV, in addition to contributing to the relaxation of positive supercoils, is essential at the terminal stages of DNA replication and functions to “unlink” newly replicated chromosomes to allow for the completion of cell division.[A31453]

This This 6-member ring enables cefdinir and other cephalosporins to resist inactivation by certain bacterial enzymes.[A180772]



With a mechanism similar to other beta-lactam antibiotics, the bactericidal activity of cefdinir is caused by the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Cefdinir, like other cephalosporins, penetrates the bacterial cell wall, combats inactivation by beta-lactamase enzymes, and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins.[A180772] This interferes with the final step of transpeptidation in cell walls, eventually leading to cell lysis, which eventually leads to the death of bacteria that are susceptible to this drug.[A180724] Cefdinir has shown affinity to penicillin protein binding proteins 2 and 3. [A15746,A180760,A15747] It has also been shown to inhibit transpeptidase enzymes of various bacteria, which may play a role in its bactericidal action.[A180766,A180769] One in vitro study suggests that cefdinir inhibits myeloperoxidase release extracellularly.[A11897] The impact of this potential drug target in relation to its mechanism of action is unknown.', 'Cefdinir is a bactericidal agent that treats bacterial infections by interfering with cell wall synthesis.[L7330]

The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease, and high ratios are associated with a higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, atorvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A174580,A181087,A181406,A181925] 



Elevated cholesterol levels (and high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in particular) are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Clinical studies have shown that atorvastatin reduces LDL-C and total cholesterol by 36-53%.[A177415] In patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia, atorvastatin reduced the levels of intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol.[A177397] It has also been suggested that atorvastatin can limit the extent of angiogenesis, which can be useful in the treatment of chronic subdural hematoma.[A177388]



**Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis**



Atorvastatin, like other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, is associated with a risk of drug-induced myopathy characterized by muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness in conjunction with elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK). Myopathy often manifests as rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria. The risk of statin-induced myopathy is dose-related, and the symptoms of myopathy are typically resolved upon drug discontinuation. Results from observational studies suggest that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]



**Liver Dysfunction**



Statins, like some other lipid-lowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (> 3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] occurring on two or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin in clinical trials. This effect appears to be dose-related.[F4670,F4673]



**Endocrine Effects**



Statins are associated with a risk of increased serum HbA1c and glucose levels. An _in vitro_ study demonstrated a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on human pancreatic islet β cells following treatment with atorvastatin. Moreover, insulin secretion rates decreased relative to control.[A182012]



HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and may theoretically interfere with the production of adrenal and/or gonadal steroids. Clinical studies with atorvastatin and other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have suggested that these agents do not affect plasma cortisol concentrations, basal plasma testosterone concentration, or adrenal reserve. However, the effect of statins on male fertility has not been fully investigated. The effects of statins on the pituitary-gonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown.[F4673]



**Cardiovascular**



Significant decreases in circulating ubiquinone levels in patients treated with atorvastatin and other statins have been observed. The clinical significance of a potential long-term statin-induced deficiency of ubiquinone has not been established. It has been reported that a decrease in myocardial ubiquinone levels could lead to impaired cardiac function in patients with borderline congestive heart failure.[F4673]



**Lipoprotein A**



In some patients, the beneficial effect of lowered total cholesterol and LDL-C levels may be partly blunted by the concomitant increase in Lp(a) lipoprotein concentrations. Present knowledge suggests the importance of high Lp(a) levels as an emerging risk factor for coronary heart disease.[F4673] Further studies have demonstrated statins affect Lp(a) levels differently in patients with dyslipidemia depending on their apo(a) phenotype; statins increase Lp(a) levels exclusively in patients with the low molecular weight apo(a) phenotype.[A181418]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

8) Management of alcohol withdrawal.[A178174,A178177]', 'Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker, called such because it selectively binds to the β1-adrenergic receptor as an antagonist up to a reported 26 fold more than β2 receptors.[A178372] Selective activity at the β1 receptor produces cardioselectivity due to the higher population of this receptor in cardiac tissue. Some binding to β2 and possibly β3 receptors can still occur at therapeutic dosages but the effects mediated by antagonizing these are significantly reduced from those of non-selective agents. β1 and β2 receptors are G<sub>s</sub> coupled therefore antagonism of their activation reduces activity of adenylyl cyclase and its downstream signalling via cyclic adenosime monophosphate and protein kinase A (PKA). 



In cardiomyocytes PKA is thought to mediate activation of L-type calcium channels and ryanodine receptors through their phosphorylation.[A178396] L-type calcium channels can then provide an initial rise in intracellular calcium and trigger the ryanodine receptors to release calcium stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and increased contractility. PKA also plays a role in the cessation of contraction by phosphorylating phospholamban which in turn increases the affinity of SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase to increase reuptake of calcium into the SR. It also phophorylates troponin I to reduce affinity of the protein for calcium. Both of these events lead to a reduction in contraction which, when coupled with the initial increase in contraction, allows for faster cycling and consequently higher heart rate with increased contractility. L-type calcium channels are also a major contributor to cardiac depolarization and their activation can increase frequency of action potentials and possibly the incidence of ectopic potentials.[A178405] 



Similar inihibitory events occur in the bronchial smooth muscle to mediate relaxation including phosphorylation of myosin light-chain kinase, reducing its affinity for calcium.[A178408] PKA also inhibits the excitatory G<sub>q</sub> coupled pathway by phosphorylating the inositol trisphosphate receptor and phospholipase C resulting in inhibition of intracellular calcium release. Antagonism of this activity by beta-blocker agents like atenolol can thus cause increased bronchoconstriction.

', 'Atenolol is a cardio-selective beta-blocker and as such exerts most of its effects on the heart.[label] It acts as an antagonist to sympathetic innervation and prevents increases in heart rate, electrical conductivity, and contractility in the heart due to increased release of norepinephrine from the peripheral nervous system.[label,T116,A178258] Together the decreases in contractility and rate produce a reduction in cardiac output resulting in a compensatory increase in peripheral vascular resistance in the short-term. This response later declines to baseline with long-term use of atenolol. More importantly, this reduction in the work demanded of the myocardium also reduces oxygen demand which provides therapeutic benefit by reducing the mismatch of oxygen supply and demand in settings where coronary blood flow is limited, such as in coronary atherosclerosis. Reducing oxygen demand, particularly due to exercise, can reduce the frequency of angina pectoris symptoms and potentially improve survival of the remaining myocardium after myocardial infarction. The decrease in rate of sinoatrial node potentials, electrical conduction, slowing of potentials traveling through the atrioventricular node, and reduced frequency of ectopic potentials due to blockade of adrenergic beta receptors has led to benefit in arrhythmic conditions such as atrial fibrillation by controlling the rate of action potential generation and allowing for more effective coordinated contractions. Since a degree of sympathetic activity is necessary to maintain cardiac function, the reduced contractility induced by atenolol may precipitate or worsen heart failure, especially during volume overload.[label]



The effects of atenolol on blood pressure have been established, although it is less effective than alternative beta-blockers, but the mechanism has not yet been characterized.[label,T116] As a β1 selective drug, it does not act via the vasodilation produced by non-selective agents.[T116] Despite this there is a sustained reduction in peripheral vascular resistance, and consequently blood pressure, alongside a decrease in cardiac output. It is thought that atenolol''s antihypertensive activity may be related to action on the central nervous system (CNS) or it''s inhibition of the renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system rather than direct effects on the vasculature.[label]



Atenolol produces CNS effects similar to other beta-blockers, but does so to a lesser extent due to reduces ability to cross the blood-brain barrier.[T116] It has the potential to produce fatigue, depression, and sleep disturbances such as nightmares or insomnia.[label,T116] The exact mechanisms behind these have not been characterized but their occurrence must be considered as they represent clinically relevant adverse effects.



Atenolol exerts some effects on the respiratory system although to a much lesser extent than non-selective beta-blockers.[label] Interaction with β2 receptors in the airways can produce bronchoconstriction by blocking the relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle mediated by the sympathetic nervous system.[T116] The same action can interfere with β-agonist therapies used in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.[label,A178258,T116]



Unlike some other beta-blocker drugs, atenolol does not have intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activity nor does it produce changes in glycemic control.[label]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

IKZF1 and IKZF3 are B-cell transcription factors that are essential for B-cell differentiation and survival of malignant cells. IKZF3 also regulates the expression of interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), which is a transcription factor that regulates the aberrant myeloma-specific gene. The immunomodulatory actions of lenalidomide can be partly explained by the degradation of IKZF3, since it is a repressor of the interleukin 2 gene (IL2): as lenalidomide decreases the level of IKZF3, the production of IL-2 increases, thereby increasing the proliferation of natural killer (NK), NKT cells, and CD4+ T cells.[A228703] Lenalidomide inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-12, while elevating the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.[A228543] Lenalidomide acts as a T-cell co-stimulatory molecule that promotes CD3 T-cell proliferation and increases the production of IL-2 and IFN-γ in T lymphocytes, which enhances NK cell cytotoxicity and ADCC. It inhibits the expression and function of T-regulatory cells, which are often overabundant in some hematological malignancies.[A228708] 



Lenalidomide directly exerts antitumour effects by inhibiting the proliferation and inducing apoptosis of tumour cells. Lenalidomide triggers the activation of pro-apoptotic caspase-8, enhances tumour cell sensitivity to FAS-induced apoptosis, and downregulates NF-κB, an anti-apoptotic protein.[A228708] Independent of its immunomodulatory effects, lenalidomide mediates anti-angiogenic effects by inhibiting angiogenic growth factors released by tumour cells, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblastic-growth factor (BFGF), and hepatocyte-growth factor. _In vitro_, lenalidomide inhibits cell adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1, LFA-1, β2 and β3 integrins, as well as gap-junction function, thereby preventing metastasis of malignant cells.[A228708] ', 'In hematological malignancies, the immune system is deregulated in the form of altered cytokine networks in the tumour microenvironment, defective T cell regulation of host-tumour immune interactions, and diminished NK cell activity.[A228543] Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent with antineoplastic, antiangiogenic, and anti-inflammatory properties.[A228628] Lenalidomide exerts direct cytotoxicity by increasing apoptosis and inhibiting the proliferation of hematopoietic malignant cells.[A228708] It delays tumour growth in nonclinical hematopoietic tumour models _in vivo_, including multiple myeloma.[L16028] Lenalidomide also works to limit the invasion or metastasis of tumour cells and inhibits angiogenesis.[A228708]



Lenalidomide also mediates indirect antitumour effects via its immunomodulatory actions: it inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are implicated in various hematologic malignancies. Lenalidomide enhances the host immunity by stimulating T cell proliferation and enhancing the activity of natural killer (NK) cells.[A713, A228703, A228708] Lenalidomide is about 100–1000 times more potent in stimulating T cell proliferation than [thalidomide].[A228543] _In vitro_, it enhances antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), which is even more pronounced when used in combination with rituximab.[L16028] Due to its anti-inflammatory properties, lenalidomide has been investigated in the context of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[A229418] ', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

It is proposed that peppermint oil relaxes gastrointestinal smooth muscle and attenuates contractile responses by reducing the influx of extracellular calcium ions. In rabbit jejunum smooth muscle cells investigated via whole cell clamp configuration technique, peppermint oil was shown to inhibit the potential-dependent calcium currents in a concentration-dependent manner [A33056]. Both a reduction in peak current amplitude and an increase in the rate of current decay were observed, indicating that the pharmacological activity peppermint oil resembles that of dihydropyridine calcium antagonists [A33056]. In a rat small intestine study, peppermint oil in the intestinal lumen inhibited enterocyte glucose uptake via a direct action on the brush border membrane and inhibited intestinal secretion [A33056]. There is also evidence that menthol is an antagonist of L-type Ca2+ channels via interacting with dihydropyridine binding sites and blocks the currents of low-voltage-activated calcium channels [A33056]. Peppermint oil may facilitate hair growth by promoting the conservation of vascularization of hair dermal papilla, which may contribute to the induction of early anagen stage of active growth phase of hair follicles [A33044]. ', 'Peppermint oil induces a dose-related antispasmodic effects on the gastrointestinal smooth muscles [A33056]. A meta-analysis study and additional clinical studies of patients with IBS demonstrated that the treatment with peppermint oil improves abdominal symptoms compared to the placebo group, resulting in reduced severity of abdominal pain, decreased abdominal distension, reduced stool frequency, and reduced flatulence [A33055, A33057]. The use of enteric-coated peppermint oil was shown to be effective in reducing gastrointestinal symptoms of non-ulcer dyspepsia [A33055]. In rats, peppermint oil promoted a time-dependent choleretic  effect in increasing bile production and biliary output [A33056]. In randomized controlled trials, topical application of peppermint oil was associated with a significant analgesic effect and a reduction in headache intensity compared to placebo [A33055]. In a study of C57BL/6 mice, topical application of peppermint oil for 4 weeks was associated with a prominent hair growth effects; a significant increase in dermal thickness, follicle number, and follicle depth [A33044].

Contact between extracelluar calcium 2+ and osteoclast CaSRs stimulates the phospholipase C (PLC) dependant breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) into the two secondary messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). Whereas the calcium-CaSRs interaction then performs IP3 Adependent translocation of nuclear factor NF-kB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in mature osteoclasts, strontium-CaSRs interactions involves a DAG-PKC beta II (protein kinase C beta II) signalling pathway for translocating NF-kB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in an IP3-independent manner. Although the calcium 2+ and strontium 2+ mediated signalling pathways are different, both CaSR interactions induce osteoclast apoptosis and are in fact capable of potentiating each other, leading to enhanced osteoclast apoptosis and decreased bone tissue degradation [A31565].



At the same time, given the similarity between the calcium 2+ and strontium 2+ cations, strontium 2+ cations from strontium ranelate are seemingly also able to act as an agonist and stimulate the CaSRs on osteoblasts, possibly in tandem with various local osteoblast stimulatory growth factors like transforming growth factor β (TGF β) and/or bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), to stimulate cyclic D genes and early oncogenes like c-fos and egr-1 that can mediate the mitogenesis and proliferation of new or more osteoblasts [A31580]. Moreover, although the involvement of the PLC mediated pathway may be a part of the signalling mechanism in osteoblasts following the stimulation of their CaSRs, this has not yet been fully elucidated [A31580].



Furthermore, strontium ranelate is also thought to be capable of stimulating osteoblasts to enhance the expression of osteoprotegerin while also concurrently reducing the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-Β ligand (RANKL) in primary human osteoblastic cells. As osteoprotegerin can competitively bind to RANKL as a decoy receptor, which can prevent RANKL from binding to RANK, which is an activity that facilitates the signaling pathway for the differentiation and activaiton of osteoclasts. The subsequent net effect of these actions ultiamtely results in decreased osteoclastogenesis. [A31553]



Moreover, bone biopsies obtained from patients treated with stronatium ranelate in clinical study reveal improvements in intrinsic bone tissue quality and microarchitecutre in ostepoerosis as evidenced by increased trabecular number, decreased trabecular separation, lower structure model index, and increased cortical thickness associated with a shift in trabecular structure from rod to plate like configurations compared with control patients [A31553].



Additionally, strontium from administered strontium ranelate is absorbed onto the crystal surface of treated bones and only slightly substitiutes for calcium in the apatite crystal of newly formed bone. As a result, there is an increased X-ray absorption of strontium as compared to calcium, which can lead to an amplification of bone mineral density (BMD) measurement by dual-proton X-ray absorptiometry. In essence, although strontium ranelate use can increase BMD some of the observations may be overestimations due to skeletal accretion of strontium in strontium ranelate treated patients [A31553].



Having the ability to both generate more osetoblasts and decrease the number of osteoclasts gives strontium ranelate an apparent dual mechanism of action when used to treat osteoperosis.', 'In general, it is believed that strontium ranelate is capable of affecting a rebalance in bone turnover in favour of bone formation by: (1) increasing osteoblast differentiation from progenitors, osteoblast activity and survival, as well as regulating osteoblast-induced osteoclastogenesis, and (2) decreasing osteoclast differentiation and activity, as well as increasing osteoclast apoptosis [A31541]. 



It has also been shown that strontium ranelate is capable of improving and strengthening various components of overall bone tissue quality like bone mineral density and bone microarchitecture [A31541, A31542, A31553].   ', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Migraine attacks are generally divided into phases: the premonitory phase, which typically involves irritability, fatigue, yawning, and stiff neck; the headache phase, which lasts for between four and 72 hours; and the postdrome phase, which lasts for up to a day following resolution of pain and whose symptoms are similar to those of the premonitory phase. In addition, neurological deficits, collectively termed migraine aura, may precede the headache phase.[A193797, A193794]



The underlying pathophysiology of migraines is a matter of active research but involves both neurological and vascular components. The head pain associated with migraine is thought to be a consequence of activation of the nociceptive nerves comprising the trigeminocervical complex (TCC).[A193794] Terminals of nociceptive nerves that innervate the dura matter release vasoactive peptides, such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), resulting in cranial vasodilation. Finally, when present, migraine aura appears to correlate with a transient wave(s) of cortical depolarization, termed cortical spreading depression (CSD).[A193794,A193851]



Triptans, including zolmitriptan, are proposed to act in three ways. The main mechanism is through modulation of nociceptive nerve signalling in the central nervous system through 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> receptors throughout the TCC and associated areas of the brain. In addition, triptans can enhance vasoconstriction, both through direct 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>-mediated dilation of cranial blood vessels,[A462, A198741] as well as through 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>-mediated suppression of CGRP release.[A193794, L12978]



Although triptans are classically described solely in terms of their effects on 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> receptors, they also act as 5-HT<sub>1F</sub> agonists as well. This 5-HT subtype is also found throughout the TCC, but is not present appreciably in cerebral vasculature; the significance of triptan-mediated 5-HT<sub>1F</sub> activation is currently not well described.[A193791] Additionally, CSD that initiates in the ipsilateral parietal region may exert its effects in a manner that relies on 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> receptor activation, suggesting that triptans may have some effect on CSD-mediated symptoms.[A193794, A198738]', 'Zolmitriptan, like other triptans, is a serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) receptor agonist, with enhanced specificity for the 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptor subtypes. It is through the downstream effects of 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> activation that triptans are proposed to provide acute relief of migraines.[L12978,A462,A193791] Zolmitriptan is also a vasoconstrictor,[A193803] leading to possible adverse cardiovascular effects such as myocardial ischemia/infarction, arrhythmias, cerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, gastrointestinal ischemia, and peripheral vasospastic reactions. In addition, chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, and/or pressure has been reported, along with the possibility of medication overuse headaches and serotonin syndrome.

PGE<sub>2</sub> is the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.[A179023] It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.[T116,A179023] PGE<sub>2</sub> activates the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled EP<sub>1</sub> receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE<sub>2</sub> also activates the EP<sub>4</sub> receptor, coupled to G<sub>s</sub>, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE<sub>2</sub> act via EP<sub>3</sub> to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP<sub>2</sub> to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI<sub>2</sub> is known to play a role via its G<sub>s</sub>-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.



PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP<sub>2</sub> receptors.[T116,A179044] Similarly to β adrenergic receptors these are G<sub>s</sub>-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE<sub>2</sub> also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.[T116] PGD<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP<sub>1</sub> receptor.[A179044] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.



PGE<sub>2</sub> can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory G<sub>q</sub> EP<sub>3</sub> receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.[T116] This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever. NSAIDs prevent the generation of PGE<sub>2</sub> thereby reducing the activity of these neurons.

Upon activation by ligands, intracellular β-subunit of IR autophosphorylates and activates tyrosine kinase domain of the IR, followed by activation and phosphorylation of regulatory proteins and downstream signalling effectors including phosphatidylinositol 2-kinase (PI3K). PI3K activates further downstream reaction cascades to activate protein kinase B (Akt) to ultimately promote translocation of glucose transporter-4 (Glut4)-vesicles from the cytoplasm to the cell surface and regulate glucose uptake [A32353]. Chromium enhances the kinase activity of insulin receptor β and increases the activity of downstream effectors, pI3-kinase and Akt. 



Under insulin-resistant conditions, chromium also promotes GLUT-4 transporter translocation that is independent of activity of IR, IRS-1, PI3-kinase, or Akt; chromium mediates cholesterol efflux from the membranes via increasing fluidity of the membrane by decreasing the membrane cholesterol and upregulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein [A32353]. As a result, intracellular GLUT-4 transporters are stimulated to translocate from intracellular to the plasma membrane, leading to enhanced glucose uptake in muscle cells [L1990]. Chromium attenuates the activity of PTP-1B _in vitro,_ which is a negative regulator of insulin signaling. It also alleviates ER stress that is observed to be elevated the suppression of insulin signaling. ER stress is thought to activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which subsequently induces serine phosphorylation of IRS and aberration of insulin signalling [A32353]. Transient upregulation of AMPK by chromium also leads to increased glucose uptake [A32353]. ', 'Trivalent chromium is part of glucose tolerance factor, an essential activator of insulin-mediated reactions. Chromium helps to maintain normal glucose metabolism and peripheral nerve function. Chromium increases insulin binding to cells, increases insulin receptor density and activates insulin receptor kinase leading to enhanced insulin sensitivity [A32351]. In chromium deficiency, intravenous administration of chromium resulted in normalization of the glucose tolerance curve from the diabetic-like curve typical of chromium deficiency [FDA Label].

Vestibular forms of vertigo are often accompanied by auditory dysfunctions such as hyperacusis, hearing loss, and tinnitus.[A220328] In most cases, adaptive mechanisms of the CNS lead to functional recovery after episodes of vertigo, however, syndromes such as Ménière''s disease tend to cause the recurrence of vertigo symptoms. This significantly impacts the quality of life and the ability to carry out daily activities.[A220318] 



**H1-receptor activity**



The mechanism of action of betahistine is multifactorial. Ménière''s disease is thought to result from a disruption of endolymphatic fluid homeostasis in the ear.[A220438] Betahistine mainly acts as a histamine H1-receptor agonist. The stimulation of H1-receptors in the inner ear causes a vasodilatory effect leading to increased permeability of blood vessels and a reduction in endolymphatic pressure; this action prevents the rupture of the labyrinth, which can contribute to the hearing loss associated with  Ménière''s disease. Betahistine is also purported to act by reducing the asymmetrical functioning of sensory vestibular organs and increasing vestibulocochlear blood flow, relieving symptoms of vertigo.[A220433]



**H3-receptor activity**



In addition to the above mechanisms, betahistine also acts as a histamine H3-receptor antagonist, increasing the turnover of histamine from postsynaptic histaminergic nerve receptors, subsequently leading to an increase in H1-agonist activity. H3-receptor antagonism elevates levels of neurotransmitters including serotonin in the brainstem, inhibiting the activity of vestibular nuclei, thus restoring proper balance and decreasing vertigo symptoms.[A220328]', 'Through its actions on the histamine receptors, betahistine provides relief from vertigo associated with Ménière''s disease.[A220328,A220433,L16388] ', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

', 'Indacaterol works by stimulating adrenergic beta-2 receptors in the smooth muscle of the airways. This causes relaxation of the muscle, thereby increasing the diameter of the airways, which become constricted in asthma and COPD. It is also long acting due to its high affinity to the lipid raft domains in the airway membrane so it slowly dissociates from the receptors. Indacaterol also has a high intrinsic efficacy so it is also very rapid acting - onset of action occurs within 5 minutes. 



The pharmacological effects of beta2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including indacaterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3’, 5’-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic monophosphate). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle. In vitro studies have shown that indacaterol has more than 24-fold greater agonist activity at beta2-receptors compared to beta1-receptors and 20-fold greater agonist activity compared to beta3-receptors. This selectivity profile is similar to formoterol. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.', 'Bronchodilator drugs are the foundation for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The principal inhaled bronchodilator treatments used are β(2) -agonists and anticholinergics, either alone or in combination. Currently available β(2) -agonists are of either short duration and used multiple times/day, or of long duration, which requires twice-daily administration. Indacaterol is considered an ultra-long-acting β(2) -agonist and was recently approved for use in the United States. Its duration of action is approximately 24 hours, allowing for once-daily administration. Furthermore, this chiral compound it is given as the R-enantiomer and acts as a full agonist. Cough was the most commonly reported adverse effect with use of indacaterol. Compared to salmeterol, it has 35% more agonist activity. Cough usually occurred within 15 seconds of inhalation of the drug, lasted around 6 seconds, was not associated with bronchospasm, and did not cause discontinuation of the drug.

This combination is also indicated to treat hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP) in patients aged 18 years and older.[L45128]



In all cases, to mitigate the risk of bacterial resistance and preserve clinical efficacy, ceftazidime should only be used for infections that are confirmed or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacterial strains.[L32935, L45128]', 'The bacterial cell wall, which is located at the periphery of Gram-positive bacteria and within the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria, comprises a glycopeptide polymer synthesized through cross-linking of glycans to peptide stems on alternating saccharides, which is known commonly as peptidoglycan.[A232920] Cell wall formation, recycling, and remodelling require numerous enzymes, including a family of enzymes with similar active site character despite distinct and sometimes overlapping roles as carboxypeptidases, endopeptidases, transpeptidases, and transglycosylases, known as "penicillin-binding proteins" (PBPs). The number of PBPs differs between bacteria, in which some are considered essential and others redundant. In general, inhibition of one or more essential PBPs results in impaired cell wall homeostasis, loss of cell integrity, and is ultimately bactericidal.[A232920, A232925, A232930]



Ceftazidime is a semisynthetic third-generation cephalosporin with broad activity against numerous Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria.[L32935] Like other β-lactam antibiotics, ceftazidime exhibits its bactericidal effect primarily through direct inhibition of specific PBPs in susceptible bacteria.[A232935] _In vitro_ experiments in Gram-negative bacteria such as _Escherichia coli_, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, _Acinetobacter baumannii_, and _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ suggest that ceftazidime primarily binds to PBP3, with weaker binding to PBP1a/1b and PBP2 as well; although binding to other PBPs, such as PBP4, is detectable, the concentrations required are much greater than those achieved clinically.[A232935, A16721, A232940, A232945, A232950] Similarly, ceftazidime showed binding to _Staphylococcus aureus_ PBP 1, 2, and 3 with a much lower affinity for PBP4.[A16721] Recent data for _Mycobacterium abcessus_ suggest that ceftazidime can inhibit PonA1, PonA2, and PbpA at intermediate concentrations.[A232930]', 'Ceftazidime is a semisynthetic, broad-spectrum, third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic that is bactericidal through inhibition of enzymes responsible for cell-wall synthesis, primarily penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP3).[L32935] Among cephalosporins, ceftazidime is notable for its resistance to numerous β-lactamases and its broad spectrum of activity against Gram-negative bacteria, including _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_.[A232935] However, it is less active than first- and second-generation cephalosporins against _Staphylococcus aureus_ and other Gram-positive bacteria and also has low activity against anaerobes.[A232935, A233160] Ceftazidime has confirmed activity against clinically relevant Gram-negative bacteria including _Citrobacter_ spp., _Enterobacter_ spp., _Klebsiella_ spp., _Proteus_ spp., _Serratia spp., _Escherichia coli_, _Haemophilus influenzae_, _Neisseria meningitidis_, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, and some Gram-positive bacteria including _Staphylococcus_ spp. and _Streptococcus_ spp. There are also _in vitro_ data for ceftazidime efficacy against a wide variety of other bacteria, such as _Acinetobacter baumannii_ and _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_, but no clear clinical studies to support the use of ceftazidime for infections caused by these bacteria.[L32935]



Although β-lactam antibiotics like ceftazidime are generally well tolerated, there remains a risk of serious acute hypersensitivity reactions, which is higher in patients with a known allergy to ceftazidime or any other β-lactam antibiotic. As with all antibiotics, ceftazidime may result in the overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms and potentially serious effects including _Clostridium difficile_-associated diarrhea (CDAD); CDAD should be considered in patients who develop diarrhea and, in confirmed cases, supportive care initiated immediately. Ceftazidime is primarily renally excreted such that high and prolonged serum concentrations can occur in patients with renal insufficiency, leading to seizures, nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), encephalopathy, coma, asterixis, neuromuscular excitability, and myoclonia. Treatment may lead to the development or induction of resistance with a risk of treatment failure. Periodic susceptibility testing should be considered, and monotherapy failure may necessitate the addition of another antibiotic such as an aminoglycoside. Cephalosporin use may decrease prothrombin activity, which may be improved by exogenous vitamin K.

It is often used in combination with [misoprostol] as a gastro-protective agent in patients with high risk of developing NSAID-induced ulcers.', 'Diclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 and -2, the enzymes responsible for production of prostaglandin (PG) G<sub>2</sub> which is the precursor to other PGs.[label,T116] These molecules have broad activity in pain and inflammation and the inhibition of their production is the common mechanism linking each effect of diclofenac.



PGE<sub>2</sub> is the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.[A179023] It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.[T116,A179023] PGE<sub>2</sub> activates the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled EP<sub>1</sub> receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE<sub>2</sub> also activates the EP<sub>4</sub> receptor, coupled to G<sub>s</sub>, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE<sub>2</sub> act via EP<sub>3</sub> to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP<sub>2</sub> to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI<sub>2</sub> is known to play a role via its G<sub>s</sub>-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.



PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP<sub>2</sub> receptors.[T116,A179044] Similarly to β adrenergic receptors these are G<sub>s</sub>-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE<sub>2</sub> also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.[T116] PGD<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP<sub>1</sub> receptor.[A179044] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.



PGE<sub>2</sub> can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory G<sub>q</sub> EP<sub>3</sub> receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.[T116] This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever. NSAIDs prevent the generation of PGE<sub>2</sub> thereby reducing the activity of these neurons.

As an active agent indicated for relieving certain cold symptoms and/or certain muscular sprains and cramps, it is believed that eucalyptus oil may possess some antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities.



Some in vitro studies of human blood monocytes suggest a dose-dependent effect of eucalyptus oil to elicit significant inhibition of multiple cytokines, perhaps in the treatment of airway inflammation [A32244, A32245].

PGE<sub>2</sub> is the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.[A179023] It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.[T116,A179023] PGE<sub>2</sub> activates the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled EP<sub>1</sub> receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE<sub>2</sub> also activates the EP<sub>4</sub> receptor, coupled to G<sub>s</sub>, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE<sub>2</sub> act via EP<sub>3</sub> to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP<sub>2</sub> to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI<sub>2</sub> is known to play a role via its G<sub>s</sub>-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.



PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP<sub>2</sub> receptors.[T116,A179044] Similarly to β adrenergic receptors these are G<sub>s</sub>-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE<sub>2</sub> also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.[T116] PGD<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP<sub>1</sub> receptor.[A179044] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.



PGE<sub>2</sub> can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory G<sub>q</sub> EP<sub>3</sub> receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.[T116] This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever. NSAIDs prevent the generation of PGE<sub>2</sub> thereby reducing the activity of these neurons.

Tramadol is also used off-label in the treatment of premature ejaculation.[A173986]', 'Tramadol is a centrally acting μ-opioid receptor agonist and SNRI (serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake-inhibitor) that is structurally related to [codeine] and [morphine]. Tramadol binds weakly to κ- and δ-opioid receptors and to the μ-opioid receptor with 6000-fold less affinity than morphine.[A182300]



Tramadol exists as a racemic mixture consisting of two pharmacologically active enantiomers that both contribute to its analgesic property through different mechanisms: (+)-tramadol and its primary metabolite (+)-O-desmethyl-tramadol (M1) are agonists of the μ opioid receptor while (+)-tramadol inhibits serotonin reuptake and (-)-tramadol inhibits norepinephrine reuptake. These pathways are complementary and synergistic, improving tramadol''s ability to modulate the perception of and response to pain.[A4269] 



In animal models, M1 is up to 6 times more potent than tramadol in producing analgesia and 200 times more potent in μ-opioid binding.[L9257] 



Tramadol has also been shown to affect a number of pain modulators including alpha2-adrenoreceptors, neurokinin 1 receptors, the voltage-gated sodium channel type II alpha subunit[A183728], transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1 - also known as the capsaicin receptor)[A183734], muscarinic receptors (M1 and M3), N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (also known as the NMDA receptor or glutamate receptor)[A17158], Adenosine A1 receptors[A183761], and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.[A17159] 



In addition to the above neuronal targets, tramadol has a number of effects on inflammatory and immune mediators involved in the pain response. This includes inhibitory effects on cytokines, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), nuclear factor-κB, and glial cells as well as a change in the polarization state of M1 macrophages.[A182300]', 'Tramadol modulates the descending pain pathways within the central nervous system through the binding of parent and M1 metabolite to μ-opioid receptors and the weak inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.[A173983,A173980] 



Apart from analgesia, tramadol may produce a constellation of symptoms (including dizziness, somnolence, nausea, constipation, sweating and pruritus) similar to that of other opioids. 



**Central Nervous System**



In contrast to [morphine], tramadol has not been shown to cause histamine release. At therapeutic doses, tramadol has no effect on heart rate, left-ventricular function or cardiac index. Orthostatic hypotension has been observed.[L9257]



Tramadol produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centres. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem centres to increases in CO2 tension and to electrical stimulation. 



Tramadol depresses the cough reflex by a direct effect on the cough centre in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia.



Tramadol causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but

are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce

similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of

oxycodone overdose.[F4679]



Seizures have been reported in patients receiving tramadol within the recommended dosage range. Spontaneous post-marketing reports indicate that seizure risk is increased with doses of tramadol above the recommended range. Risk of convulsions may also increase in patients with epilepsy, those with a history of seizures

or in patients with a recognized risk for seizure (such as head trauma, metabolic disorders,

alcohol and drug withdrawal, CNS infections), or with concomitant use of other drugs known to reduce the seizure threshold.[F4679]



Tramadol can cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs (e.g., anti-depressants, migraine medications). Treatment with the serotoninergic drug should be discontinued if such events (characterized by clusters of symptoms such as hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs, mental status changes including confusion, irritability, extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma) occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated. Tramadol should not be used in combination with MAO inhibitors or serotonin-precursors (such as L-tryptophan, oxitriptan) and should be used with caution in combination with other serotonergic drugs (triptans, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lithium, St. John’s Wort) due to the risk of serotonin syndrome.[F4679]



**Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle**



Tramadol causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.[F4679]



**Endocrine System**



Opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal or -gonadal axes. Some changes that can be seen include an increase in serum prolactin and decreases in plasma cortisol and testosterone. Clinical signs and symptoms may be manifest from these hormonal changes.[F4679]



Hyponatremia has been reported very rarely with the use of tramadol, usually in patients with predisposing risk factors, such as elderly patients and/or patients using concomitant medications that may cause hyponatremia (e.g., antidepressants, benzodiazepines, diuretics). In some reports, hyponatremia appeared to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) and resolved with discontinuation of tramadol and appropriate treatment (e.g., fluid restriction). During tramadol treatment, monitoring for signs and symptoms of hyponatremia is recommended for patients with predisposing risk factors.[F4679]



**Cardiovascular**



Tramadol administration may result in severe hypotension in patients whose ability to maintain adequate blood pressure is compromised by reduced blood volume, or concurrent administration of drugs such as phenothiazines and other tranquillizers, sedative/hypnotics, tricyclic antidepressants or general anesthetics. These patients should be monitored for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of tramadol.[F4679]



**QTc-Interval Prolongation**



The maximum placebo-adjusted mean change from baseline in the QTcF interval was 5.5 ms in the 400 mg/day treatment arm and 6.5 ms in the 600 mg/day mg treatment arm, both occurring at the 8h time point. Both treatment groups were within the 10 ms threshold for QT prolongation. Post-marketing experience with the use of tramadol containing products included rare reports of QT prolongation reported with an overdose. Particular care should be exercised when administering tramadol to patients who are suspected to be at an increased risk of experiencing torsade de pointes during treatment with a QTc-prolonging drug.[F4679]



**Abuse and Misuse**



Like all opioids, tramadol has the potential for abuse and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Therefore, tramadol should be prescribed and handled with caution.[F4679]



**Dependence/Tolerance**



Physical dependence and tolerance reflect the neuroadaptation of the opioid receptors to chronic exposure to an opioid and are separate and distinct from abuse and addiction. Tolerance, as well as physical dependence, may develop upon repeated administration of opioids, and are not by themselves evidence of an addictive disorder or abuse. Patients on prolonged therapy should be tapered gradually from the drug if it is no longer required for pain control. Withdrawal symptoms may occur following abrupt discontinuation of therapy or upon administration of an opioid antagonist. Some of the symptoms that may be associated with abrupt withdrawal of an opioid analgesic include body aches, diarrhea, gooseflesh, loss of appetite, nausea, nervousness or restlessness, anxiety, runny nose, sneezing, tremors or shivering, stomach cramps, tachycardia, trouble with sleeping, unusual increase in sweating, palpitations, unexplained fever, weakness and yawning.[F4679]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Activation of ClC-2 chloride channels causes an efflux of chloride ions into the lumen, which in turn leads to an efflux of sodium ions through a paracellular pathway to maintain isoelectric neutrality. As a result, water follows sodium into the lumen in order to maintain isotonic equilibrium, thereby increasing intestinal fluid secretion. By increasing intestinal fluid secretion, lubiprostone increases motility in the intestine, thereby increasing the passage of stool and alleviating symptoms associated with chronic idiopathic constipation. Activation of ClC-2 chloride channels may also stimulate the recovery of muscosal barrier function by restoring tight junction protein complexes in the intestine. Patch clamp cell studies in human cell lines have indicated that the majority of the beneficial biological activity of lubiprostone and its metabolites is observed only on the apical (luminal) portion of the gastrointestinal epithelium.', 'Chronic idiopathic constipation is generally defined by infrequent or difficult passage of stool. The signs and symptoms associated with chronic idiopathic constipation (i.e., abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating, straining, and hard or lumpy stools) may be the result of abnormal colonic motility that can delay the transit of intestinal contents and impede the evacuation of rectal contents. One approach to the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation is the secretion of fluid into the abdominal lumen through the activation of chloride channels in the apical membrane of the gastrointestinal epithelium.

Pharyngitis/tonsillitis caused by _Streptococcus pyogenes_ as an alternative to first-line therapy in individuals who cannot use first-line therapy.', 'In order to replicate, bacteria require a specific process of protein synthesis, enabled by ribosomal proteins [A6505]. Azithromycin binds to the 23S rRNA of the bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit. It stops bacterial protein synthesis by inhibiting the transpeptidation/translocation step of protein synthesis and by inhibiting the assembly of the 50S ribosomal subunit [FDA label], [A14179]. This results in the control of various bacterial infections [A174193], [FDA label].   The strong affinity of macrolides, including azithromycin, for bacterial ribosomes, is consistent with their broad‐spectrum antibacterial activities [A174193].

Whereas drugs like colchicine cause the depolymerization of microtubules in vivo, paclitaxel arrests their function by having the opposite effect; it hyper-stabilizes their structure. This destroys the cell''s ability to use its cytoskeleton in a flexible manner. Specifically, paclitaxel binds to the &beta; subunit of tubulin. Tubulin is the "building block" of mictotubules, and the binding of paclitaxel locks these building blocks in place. The resulting microtubule/paclitaxel complex does not have the ability to disassemble. This adversely affects cell function because the shortening and lengthening of microtubules (termed dynamic instability) is necessary for their function as a transportation highway for the cell. Chromosomes, for example, rely upon this property of microtubules during mitosis. Further research has indicated that paclitaxel induces programmed cell death (apoptosis) in cancer cells by binding to an apoptosis stopping protein called Bcl-2 (B-cell leukemia 2) and thus arresting its function.', 'Paclitaxel is a taxoid antineoplastic agent indicated as first-line and subsequent therapy for the treatment of advanced carcinoma of the ovary, and other various cancers including breast cancer.

Under EMA approval, such fish oil pharmaceuticals comprised of virtually the same fish and fish oil derived omega-3-fatty acids EPA and DHA are indicated specifically for (a) adjuvant treatment in secondary prevention after myocardial infarction, in addition to other standard therapy (ie. statins, antiplatelet medicinal products, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors), and (b) as a supplement to diet when dietary measures alone are insufficient to produce an adequate response, particularly with type IV hypertriglyceridemia in monotherapy or type IIb/III in combination with statins, when control of triglycerides is insufficient [L2661]. In addition, prescribing information for EMA approved fish oil pharmaceuticals are also indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce very high (>=500 mg/dL) triglyceride levels in adult patients, much like similar FDA approved indications [F37, FDA Label].', 'The specific mechanism of action by which the fish oil EPA and DHA acids are capable of reducing serum triglyceride levels is not yet fully understood [FDA Label, A32933]. Nevertheless, it is proposed that such omega-3-fatty acids may not be the preferred substrates of the enzyme diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase that participates in the generation of triglycerides; that  they might interact with nuclear transcription factors that manage lipogenesis; or that their presence and increase in levels can cause cellular metabolism to subsequently shift toward a decrease in triglyceride synthesis and an increase in fatty acid oxidation [A32933]. Moreover, the EPA and DHA acids are also believed to be able to promote apolipoprotein B degradation in the liver through the stimulation of an autophagic process [A32933]. It may also be possible that these fish oil acids can accelerate the clearance of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles and chylomicron [A32933]. The combination of all these actions results in fewer VLDL particles being assembled and secreted, which is of considerable importance as VLDL particles are the major endogenous source of triglycerides [A32933].



Moreover, new paradigms of how inflammation is contained and dissipated involve various newly discovered chemical mediators, resolvins, and protectins [A32933]. Such agents are believed to be directly involved in blocking neutrophil migration, infiltration, recruitment, as well as blocking T-cell migration and promoting T-cell apoptosis [A32933]. Additionally, such protectins can also reduce tumor necrosis factor and interferon secretion [A32933]. Of particular importance, however, is the fact that protectins and resolvins are exclusively derived from omega-3-fatty acids and that EPA is the substrate of the resolvins family and DHA can be converted to both resolvins and protectins [A32933]. It is believed that these effects of such fish oil acids underlie the actions that fish oil have demonstrated on eliciting stability for vulnerable inflammatory plaques [A32933].



Finally, fish oil acids have demonstrated certain direct electrophysiological effects on the myocardium [A32933]. In animal studies, it was shown that the ventricular fibrillation threshold could be increased in both animals fed or infused with omega-3-fatty acids [A32933]. Further studies subsequently revealed that such fatty acids could reduce both sodium currents and L-type calcium currents on a cellular and ion channel level [A32933]. It is consequently hypothesized that during ischemia, a reduction in the sodium ion current protects hyperexcitable tissue, and a reduction in the calcium ion current could reduce arrhythmogenic depolarizing currents - and that perhaps the use of EPA and DHA fish oil acids could facilitate such activity [A32933]. For the time being, however, omega-3-fatty acids in pharmaceutical supplement form have not been shown to elicit such protection against heart conditions [L2662].', 'In general, the only practical method of obtaining and increasing the levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) fish oil omega-3-fatty acids in the body is to consume them directly from foods and/or dietary supplements [L784]. Having EPA and DHA is important because they facilitate numerous important functions in the human body. As an example, such supplementation of fish oil EPA and DHA demonstrates a legitimate ability to decrease triglyceride levels as their presence in the body can act as poor substrates for the enzymes that are ordinarily responsible for triglyceride synthesis and also inhibit the esterification of other fatty acids, among other mechanisms [FDA Label, L2661].



Moreover, such fish oil acids can become important components of the phospholipids that form the structures of cell membranes [L784]. Specifically, DHA is particularly high in the retina, brain, and sperm [L784]. Additionally, these acids also provide energy for the body and are used to form eicosanoids - signaling molecules that have similar chemical structures to the fish oil fatty acids from which they are derived [L784]. Furthermore, such eicosanoids possess wide-ranging functions in the cardiovascular, pulmonary, immune, and endocrine systems [L784].', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Initial symptoms of biotin deficiency include: Dry skin, Seborrheic dermatitis, Fungal infections, rashes including erythematous periorofacial macular rash, fine and brittle hair, and hair loss or total alopecia. If left untreated, neurological symptoms can develop, including mild depression, which may progress to profound lassitude and, eventually, to somnolence; changes in mental status, generalized muscular pains (myalgias), hyperesthesias and paresthesias. The treatment for biotin deficiency is to simply start taking some biotin supplements. A lack of biotin in infants will lead to a condition called seborrheic dermatitis or "cradle cap".

This destroys the cell''s ability to use its cytoskeleton in a flexible manner. Specifically, paclitaxel binds to the &beta; subunit of tubulin. Tubulin is the "building block" of mictotubules, and the binding of paclitaxel locks these building blocks in place. The resulting microtubule/paclitaxel complex does not have the ability to disassemble. This adversely affects cell function because the shortening and lengthening of microtubules (termed dynamic instability) is necessary for their function as a transportation highway for the cell. Chromosomes, for example, rely upon this property of microtubules during mitosis. Further research has indicated that paclitaxel induces programmed cell death (apoptosis) in cancer cells by binding to an apoptosis stopping protein called Bcl-2 (B-cell leukemia 2) and thus arresting its function.', 'Paclitaxel is a taxoid antineoplastic agent indicated as first-line and subsequent therapy for the treatment of advanced carcinoma of the ovary, and other various cancers including breast cancer.

This inhibits the AT1-mediated vasoconstrictive and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II and results in an overall decrease in blood pressure. Candesartan is greater than 10,000 times more selective for AT1 than AT2. Inhibition of aldosterone secretion may increase sodium and water excretion while decreasing potassium excretion.', 'Candesartan cilexetil is an ARB prodrug that is rapidly converted to candesartan, its active metabolite, during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Candesartan confers blood pressure lowering effects by antagonizing the hypertensive effects of angiotensin II via the RAAS. RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. Renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is cleaved by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II increases blood pressure by increasing total peripheral resistance, increasing sodium and water reabsorption in the kidneys via aldosterone secretion, and altering cardiovascular structure. Angiotensin II binds to two receptors: type-1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1) and type-2 angiotensin II receptor (AT2). AT1 is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that mediates the vasoconstrictive and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II. Studies performed in recent years suggest that AT2 antagonizes AT1-mediated effects and directly affects long-term blood pressure control by inducing vasorelaxation and increasing urinary sodium excretion. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are non-peptide competitive inhibitors of AT1. ARBs block the ability of angiotensin II to stimulate pressor and cell proliferative effects.

Penile erection during sexual stimulation is caused by increased penile blood flow resulting from the relaxation of penile arteries and corpus cavernosal smooth muscle. This response is mediated by the release of nitric oxide (NO) from nerve terminals and endothelial cells, which stimulates the synthesis of cyclic GMP in smooth muscle cells. Cyclic GMP causes smooth muscle relaxation and increased blood flow into the corpus cavernosum. The tissue concentration of cyclic GMP is regulated by both the rates of synthesis and degradation via phosphodiesterases (PDEs), and the most abundant PDE in the human corpus cavernosum is PDE5. Therefore, the inhibition of PDE5 by vardenafil enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cyclic GMP.[L45563]', 'Vardenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), an enzyme responsible for the degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum.

Historically, cod liver oil was often given to children because the vitamin d content in the oil had been shown to prevent or treat vitamin D deficiency and condition of rickets associated with it [A33159]. Over time, this common use in children growing up may have conferred upon cod liver oil its identity as a healthy and useful all-purpose dietary supplement.



However, since cod liver oil is a composite of several other nutritional compounds including the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as well as vitamin A and vitamin D [A33159, L2872, L2871], the presence in varying amounts of all of these compounds at once makes it difficult to recommend or use cod liver oil as an appropriate supplement to confer any one particular health effect or for any one particular nutritional deficiency.



Regardless, because it does contain a combination of a number of important and healthy nutritional compounds, cod liver oil has sometimes been recommended in the literature for conferring the health effects of some of these compounds, such as the potential use of cod liver oil supplements in post-heart attack patients for secondary prophylaxis associated with the use of omega-3 fatty acids [A33165].', 'As cod liver oil consists of the component compounds of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), vitamin A, and vitamin D [A33159, L2872, L2871] further information about the mechanisms of action of these cod liver oil components can be found by searching for fish oil, vitamin A, and vitamin D on DrugBank.', 'As cod liver oil is a composite of several other nutritional compounds including the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as well as vitamin A and vitamin D [A33159, L2872, L2871], the presence in varying amounts of all of these compounds at once makes it difficult to recommend or use cod liver oil as an appropriate supplement to confer any one particular health effect or for any one particular nutritional deficiency.



For example, one tablespoon of cod liver oil contains approximately 4,080 ug of retinol (vitamin A) and 34 ug (1,360 IU) of vitamin D [L2871]. Since the general dietary reference intake of vitamin A is only 900 ug per day for adult men, 700 ug per day for women, and 3000 ug per day as the tolerable upper intake level, the regular intake of cod liver oil as a regular supplement can result in harmful levels of vitamin A accumulating in the liver and sufficient to cause hypervitaminosis A [A33163], which is associated with various symptoms such as blurred vision, changes in consciousness, skin and hair changes, liver damage, among many others.



Moreover, while cod liver oil only contains a certain percentage of the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA per amount of the oil [L2871], separate fish oils supplement products that exclusively consist of only EPA and DHA are available in a great variety of different percentage content formulations, even including prescription strength formulations should certain patients need such a level of therapy. Furthermore, such exclusive omega-3 fatty acid supplement products do not contain any vitamin A or D either, which allows patients to use the supplements without any concern about affecting their vitamin A or D levels or exposing themselves to the unnecessary excess intake of vitamins.



Subsequently, although cod liver oil contains a combination of healthy dietary supplements like EPA, DHA, vitamin A, and vitamin D, the presence in varying amounts of all of these compounds all at once makes it difficult to effectively titrate for appropriate amounts of intake for all the compounds involved when using cod liver oil as a general supplement, often resulting in either an excess or insufficient amount of one or more the aforementioned compounds.



Nevertheless, because cod liver oil does consist of the component compounds of EPA, DHA, vitamin A, and vitamin D, further information about the pharmacodynamics of these cod liver oil components can be found by searching for fish oil, vitamin A, and vitamin D on DrugBank.', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

A deficiency in iron indicates that the body cannot produce enough normal red blood cells.[A32514,L11800] Iron deficiency anemia occurs when body stores of iron decrease to very low levels, and the stored iron is insufficient to support normal red blood cell (RBC) production. Insufficient dietary iron, impaired iron absorption, bleeding, pregnancy, or loss of iron through the urine can lead to iron deficiency.[A32514,L11794]  Symptoms of iron deficiency anemia include fatigue, breathlessness, palpitations, dizziness, and headache.



Taking iron in supplement form, such as ferrous sulfate, allows for more rapid increases in iron levels when dietary supply and stores are not sufficient.[L2175] Iron is transported by the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) across the endolysosomal membrane to enter the macrophage. It can then can be incorporated into ferritin and be stored in the macrophage or carried of the macrophage by ferroportin. This exported iron is  oxidized by the enzyme to ceruloplasmin to Fe3+, followed by sequestration by transferrin for transport in the serum to various sites, including the bone marrow for hemoglobin synthesis or into the liver.[A32524] Iron combines with porphyrin and globin chains to form hemoglobin, which is critical for oxygen delivery from the lungs to other tissues.[L2263]', 'Ferrous sulfate replenishes iron, an essential component in hemoglobin, myoglobin, and various enzymes. It replaces the iron that is usually found in hemoglobin and myoglobin.

With a mechanism similar to other beta-lactam antibiotics, the bactericidal activity of cefdinir is caused by the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Cefdinir, like other cephalosporins, penetrates the bacterial cell wall, combats inactivation by beta-lactamase enzymes, and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins.[A180772] This interferes with the final step of transpeptidation in cell walls, eventually leading to cell lysis, which eventually leads to the death of bacteria that are susceptible to this drug.[A180724] Cefdinir has shown affinity to penicillin protein binding proteins 2 and 3. [A15746,A180760,A15747] It has also been shown to inhibit transpeptidase enzymes of various bacteria, which may play a role in its bactericidal action.[A180766,A180769] One in vitro study suggests that cefdinir inhibits myeloperoxidase release extracellularly.[A11897] The impact of this potential drug target in relation to its mechanism of action is unknown.', 'Cefdinir is a bactericidal agent that treats bacterial infections by interfering with cell wall synthesis.[L7330]

Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P.

When there is not enough Vitamin A to bind these receptors, natural cell differentiation and growth are interrupted.', 'Vitamin A is effective for the treatment of Vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A refers to a group of fat-soluble substances that are structurally related to and possess the biological activity of the parent substance of the group called all-<i>trans</i> retinol or retinol.

Ursodeoxycholic acid is a hydrophilic bile acid that mediates its biological effects via several mechanisms. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) protects hepatocytes and cholangiocytes from bile acid-induced damage, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction.[A256267] UDCA was shown to reserve hepatocyte cell structures and stimulate anti-apoptotic pathways.[A256267,A256272,A256458,A256463] It was also shown to prevent the production of ROS by Kupffer cells and resident macrophages in the liver, thus attenuating oxidative stress in the liver.[A256267] 



UDCA can also change the hydrophobicity index of the bile acid pool: following oral administration, UDCA forms a major fraction of the human bile acid pool and competitively displaces the hydrophobic or more toxic bile acids.[A256272,A256267] It increases the absorption of hydrophilic bile acids.[A256267] There are several proposed mechanisms of choleretic actions of UDCA: UDCA increases intracellular calcium levels, stimulating transport proteins and vesicular exocytosis in cholestatic hepatocytes.[A256267] UDCA may also upregulate the expression of membrane transport proteins like the chloride-bicarbonate anion exchanger (AE2),[A256267,A256458] which is involved in biliary secretion and is often observed to be defective in primary biliary cholangitis.[A256448] In rats, UDCA reduced hepatic expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens, suggesting immunomodulating effects.[A256267] UDCA acts as a partial agonist at the bile acid receptor, also known as the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and has negligible effects on cholesterol and lipid synthesis.[A256272]', 'Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is a secondary bile acid with cytoprotectant, immunomodulating, and choleretic effects.

Dyslipidemia describes an elevation of plasma cholesterol, triglycerides or both as well as to the presence of low levels of high-density lipoprotein. This condition represents an increased risk for the development of atherosclerosis.[L6025] 



Atorvastatin is indicated, in combination with dietary modifications, to prevent cardiovascular events in patients with cardiac risk factors and/or abnormal lipid profiles.[A177397]



Atorvastatin can be used as a preventive agent for myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization, and angina, in patients without coronary heart disease but with multiple risk factors and in patients with type 2 diabetes without coronary heart disease but multiple risk factors.[A177397]



Atorvastatin may be used as a preventive agent for non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal and non-fatal stroke, revascularization procedures, hospitalization for congestive heart failure and angina in patients with coronary heart disease.[A177397]



Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]', 'Atorvastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A177388,A181421] Atorvastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, which increases hepatic uptake of LDL. Atorvastatin also reduces Very-Low-Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol (VLDL-C), serum triglycerides (TG) and Intermediate Density Lipoproteins (IDL), as well as the number of apolipoprotein B (apo B) containing particles, but increases High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C). 



_In vitro_ and _in vivo_ animal studies also demonstrate that atorvastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] These effects include improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response. Statins were also found to bind allosterically to β2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an essential role in leukocyte trafficking and T cell activation.[A181559]', 'Atorvastatin is an oral antilipemic agent that reversibly inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. It lowers total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apo B), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease, and high ratios are associated with a higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, atorvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A174580,A181087,A181406,A181925] 



Elevated cholesterol levels (and high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in particular) are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Clinical studies have shown that atorvastatin reduces LDL-C and total cholesterol by 36-53%.[A177415] In patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia, atorvastatin reduced the levels of intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol.[A177397] It has also been suggested that atorvastatin can limit the extent of angiogenesis, which can be useful in the treatment of chronic subdural hematoma.[A177388]



**Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis**



Atorvastatin, like other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, is associated with a risk of drug-induced myopathy characterized by muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness in conjunction with elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK). Myopathy often manifests as rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria. The risk of statin-induced myopathy is dose-related, and the symptoms of myopathy are typically resolved upon drug discontinuation. Results from observational studies suggest that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]



**Liver Dysfunction**



Statins, like some other lipid-lowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (> 3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] occurring on two or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin in clinical trials. This effect appears to be dose-related.[F4670,F4673]



**Endocrine Effects**



Statins are associated with a risk of increased serum HbA1c and glucose levels. An _in vitro_ study demonstrated a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on human pancreatic islet β cells following treatment with atorvastatin. Moreover, insulin secretion rates decreased relative to control.[A182012]



HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and may theoretically interfere with the production of adrenal and/or gonadal steroids. Clinical studies with atorvastatin and other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have suggested that these agents do not affect plasma cortisol concentrations, basal plasma testosterone concentration, or adrenal reserve. However, the effect of statins on male fertility has not been fully investigated. The effects of statins on the pituitary-gonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown.[F4673]



**Cardiovascular**



Significant decreases in circulating ubiquinone levels in patients treated with atorvastatin and other statins have been observed. The clinical significance of a potential long-term statin-induced deficiency of ubiquinone has not been established. It has been reported that a decrease in myocardial ubiquinone levels could lead to impaired cardiac function in patients with borderline congestive heart failure.[F4673]



**Lipoprotein A**



In some patients, the beneficial effect of lowered total cholesterol and LDL-C levels may be partly blunted by the concomitant increase in Lp(a) lipoprotein concentrations. Present knowledge suggests the importance of high Lp(a) levels as an emerging risk factor for coronary heart disease.[F4673] Further studies have demonstrated statins affect Lp(a) levels differently in patients with dyslipidemia depending on their apo(a) phenotype; statins increase Lp(a) levels exclusively in patients with the low molecular weight apo(a) phenotype.[A181418]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

These folic acid congeners are transported across cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis where they are needed to maintain normal erythropoiesis, synthesize purine and thymidylate nucleic acids, interconvert amino acids, methylate tRNA, and generate and use formate. Using vitamin B12 as a cofactor, folic acid can normalize high homocysteine levels by remethylation of homocysteine to methionine via methionine synthetase.', 'Folic acid is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin found in foods such as liver, kidney, yeast, and leafy, green vegetables. Also known as folate or Vitamin B9, folic acid is an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in DNA and RNA synthesis. More specifically, folic acid is required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. Folic acid is the precursor of tetrahydrofolic acid, which is involved as a cofactor for transformylation reactions in the biosynthesis of purines and thymidylates of nucleic acids. Impairment of thymidylate synthesis in patients with folic acid deficiency is thought to account for the defective deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis that leads to megaloblast formation and megaloblastic and macrocytic anemias. Folic acid is particularly important during phases of rapid cell division, such as infancy, pregnancy, and erythropoiesis, and plays a protective factor in the development of cancer. As humans are unable to synthesize folic acid endogenously, diet and supplementation is necessary to prevent deficiencies. In order to function properly within the body, folic acid must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted by anti-metabolite therapies such as [DB00563] as they function as DHFR inhibitors to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, and therefore prevent the formation of DHF and THF.

PPIs such as esomeprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health.

Long term use of PPIs such as esomeprazole has been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Under EMA approval, such fish oil pharmaceuticals comprised of virtually the same fish and fish oil derived omega-3-fatty acids EPA and DHA are indicated specifically for (a) adjuvant treatment in secondary prevention after myocardial infarction, in addition to other standard therapy (ie. statins, antiplatelet medicinal products, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors), and (b) as a supplement to diet when dietary measures alone are insufficient to produce an adequate response, particularly with type IV hypertriglyceridemia in monotherapy or type IIb/III in combination with statins, when control of triglycerides is insufficient [L2661]. In addition, prescribing information for EMA approved fish oil pharmaceuticals are also indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce very high (>=500 mg/dL) triglyceride levels in adult patients, much like similar FDA approved indications [F37, FDA Label].', 'The specific mechanism of action by which the fish oil EPA and DHA acids are capable of reducing serum triglyceride levels is not yet fully understood [FDA Label, A32933]. Nevertheless, it is proposed that such omega-3-fatty acids may not be the preferred substrates of the enzyme diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase that participates in the generation of triglycerides; that  they might interact with nuclear transcription factors that manage lipogenesis; or that their presence and increase in levels can cause cellular metabolism to subsequently shift toward a decrease in triglyceride synthesis and an increase in fatty acid oxidation [A32933]. Moreover, the EPA and DHA acids are also believed to be able to promote apolipoprotein B degradation in the liver through the stimulation of an autophagic process [A32933]. It may also be possible that these fish oil acids can accelerate the clearance of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles and chylomicron [A32933]. The combination of all these actions results in fewer VLDL particles being assembled and secreted, which is of considerable importance as VLDL particles are the major endogenous source of triglycerides [A32933].



Moreover, new paradigms of how inflammation is contained and dissipated involve various newly discovered chemical mediators, resolvins, and protectins [A32933]. Such agents are believed to be directly involved in blocking neutrophil migration, infiltration, recruitment, as well as blocking T-cell migration and promoting T-cell apoptosis [A32933]. Additionally, such protectins can also reduce tumor necrosis factor and interferon secretion [A32933]. Of particular importance, however, is the fact that protectins and resolvins are exclusively derived from omega-3-fatty acids and that EPA is the substrate of the resolvins family and DHA can be converted to both resolvins and protectins [A32933]. It is believed that these effects of such fish oil acids underlie the actions that fish oil have demonstrated on eliciting stability for vulnerable inflammatory plaques [A32933].



Finally, fish oil acids have demonstrated certain direct electrophysiological effects on the myocardium [A32933]. In animal studies, it was shown that the ventricular fibrillation threshold could be increased in both animals fed or infused with omega-3-fatty acids [A32933]. Further studies subsequently revealed that such fatty acids could reduce both sodium currents and L-type calcium currents on a cellular and ion channel level [A32933]. It is consequently hypothesized that during ischemia, a reduction in the sodium ion current protects hyperexcitable tissue, and a reduction in the calcium ion current could reduce arrhythmogenic depolarizing currents - and that perhaps the use of EPA and DHA fish oil acids could facilitate such activity [A32933]. For the time being, however, omega-3-fatty acids in pharmaceutical supplement form have not been shown to elicit such protection against heart conditions [L2662].', 'In general, the only practical method of obtaining and increasing the levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) fish oil omega-3-fatty acids in the body is to consume them directly from foods and/or dietary supplements [L784]. Having EPA and DHA is important because they facilitate numerous important functions in the human body. As an example, such supplementation of fish oil EPA and DHA demonstrates a legitimate ability to decrease triglyceride levels as their presence in the body can act as poor substrates for the enzymes that are ordinarily responsible for triglyceride synthesis and also inhibit the esterification of other fatty acids, among other mechanisms [FDA Label, L2661].



Moreover, such fish oil acids can become important components of the phospholipids that form the structures of cell membranes [L784]. Specifically, DHA is particularly high in the retina, brain, and sperm [L784]. Additionally, these acids also provide energy for the body and are used to form eicosanoids - signaling molecules that have similar chemical structures to the fish oil fatty acids from which they are derived [L784]. Furthermore, such eicosanoids possess wide-ranging functions in the cardiovascular, pulmonary, immune, and endocrine systems [L784].', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

This drug promotes the relief or improvement of symptoms of Parkinson''s or restless leg syndrome by stimulatory actions on dopamine receptors, which regulate movement.



**Effects on blood pressure**



Clinical experience with dopamine agonists, including ropinirole, suggests an association with impaired abilities in regulating blood pressure with resulting orthostatic hypotension, especially with patients undergoing dose escalation. In some patients in clinical studies, blood pressure changes were associated with orthostatic symptoms, bradycardia, and, in one case in a healthy volunteer, transient sinus arrest accompanied by syncope [FDA label]. The mechanism of orthostatic hypotension caused by ropinirole is assumed to be due to a D2-mediated blunting of noradrenergic response to a standing position, followed by a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance. Nausea is also a frequent symptom which accompanies orthostatic signs and symptoms [FDA label].

PGE<sub>2</sub> is the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.[A179023] It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.[T116,A179023] PGE<sub>2</sub> activates the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled EP<sub>1</sub> receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE<sub>2</sub> also activates the EP<sub>4</sub> receptor, coupled to G<sub>s</sub>, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE<sub>2</sub> act via EP<sub>3</sub> to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP<sub>2</sub> to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI<sub>2</sub> is known to play a role via its G<sub>s</sub>-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.



PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP<sub>2</sub> receptors.[T116,A179044] Similarly to β adrenergic receptors these are G<sub>s</sub>-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE<sub>2</sub> also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.[T116] PGD<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP<sub>1</sub> receptor.[A179044] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.



PGE<sub>2</sub> can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory G<sub>q</sub> EP<sub>3</sub> receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.[T116] This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever. NSAIDs prevent the generation of PGE<sub>2</sub> thereby reducing the activity of these neurons.

It is also used in adults for the treatment of various types of peripheral neuropathic pain, such as painful diabetic neuropathy.[L8732]', 'The precise mechanism through which gabapentin exerts its therapeutic effects is unclear.[L8717,L8720] The primary mode of action appears to be at the auxillary α2δ-1 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels (though a low affinity for the α2δ-2 subunit has also been reported).[A186179,A14097,A186277] The major function of these subunits is to facilitate the movement of pore-forming α1 subunits of calcium channels from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell membrane of pre-synaptic neurons.[A186179] There is evidence that chronic pain states can cause an increase in the expression of α2δ subunits and that these changes correlate with hyperalgesia.[A14097] Gabapentin appears to inhibit the action of α2δ-1 subunits, thus decreasing the density of pre-synaptic voltage-gated calcium channels and subsequent release of excitatory neurotransmitters.[A186179] It is likely that this inhibition is also responsible for the anti-epileptic action of gabapentin.[A186277]

It lowers dopamine neuronal firing at high dopamine concentrations and increases dopamine firing at low concentrations. Its partial agonist activity gives aripiprazole an intermediate level of dopaminergic neuronal tone between full agonist and antagonist of the D2 receptor.[A258699] In addition, some adverse effects may be due to action on other receptors.[L4620] For example, orthostatic hypotension may be explained by antagonism of the adrenergic alpha-1 receptors.[L4620,A4393]', 'Aripiprazole exhibits high affinity for dopamine D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub>, serotonin 5-HT<sub>1a</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2a</sub> receptors (Ki values of 0.34 nM, 0.8 nM, 1.7 nM, and 3.4 nM, respectively), moderate affinity for dopamine D<sub>4</sub>, serotonin 5-HT<sub>2c</sub> and 5-HT<sub>7</sub>, alpha<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic and histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptors (Ki values of 44 nM, 15 nM, 39 nM, 57 nM, and 61 nM, respectively), and moderate affinity for the serotonin reuptake site (Ki=98 nM).

This binding results in displacement of divalent cations and increased membrane permeability, allowing for aminoglycoside entry.[A232294, A232304, A232309, A232314]

The second “energy-dependent phase I” of aminoglycoside entry into the cytoplasm relies on the proton-motive force and allows a limited amount of aminoglycoside access to its primary intracellular target - the bacterial 30S ribosome.[A232294, A232314] This ultimately results in the mistranslation of proteins and disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane.[A233320] Finally, in the “energy-dependent phase II” stage, concentration-dependent bacterial killing is observed. Aminoglycoside rapidly accumulates in the cell due to the damaged cytoplasmic membrane, and protein mistranslation and synthesis inhibition is amplified.[A232294, A232314, A232319] The necessity of oxygen-dependent active transport explains why aminoglycosides are ineffective against anaerobic bacteria.[A234130]

Hence, aminoglycosides have both immediate bactericidal effects through membrane disruption and delayed bactericidal effects through impaired protein synthesis; observed experimental data and mathematical modeling support this two-mechanism model.[A232294, A232299]

Inhibition of protein synthesis is a key component of aminoglycoside efficacy. Structural and cell biological studies suggest that aminoglycosides bind to the 16S rRNA in helix 44 (h44), near the A site of the 30S ribosomal subunit, altering interactions between h44 and h45. This binding also displaces two important residues, A1492 and A1493, from h44, mimicking normal conformational changes that occur with successful codon-anticodon pairing in the A site.[A232324, A232329] Overall, aminoglycoside binding has several negative effects including inhibition of translation, initiation, elongation, and ribosome recycling.[A232294, A232334, A232339] Recent evidence suggests that the latter effect is due to a cryptic second binding site situated in h69 of the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit.[A232329, A232339] Also, by stabilizing a conformation that mimics correct codon-anticodon pairing, aminoglycosides promote error-prone translation.[A232344] Mistranslated proteins can incorporate into the cell membrane, inducing the damage discussed above.[A232294, A232319]', NULL, 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);
