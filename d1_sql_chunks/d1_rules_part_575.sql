Theoretically, coadministration with other agents that can prolong the QT interval may result in additive effects and increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias including torsade de pointes and sudden death. In addition, certain agents with anticholinergic properties (e.g., sedating antihistamines; antispasmodics; neuroleptics; phenothiazines; skeletal muscle relaxants; tricyclic antidepressants; disopyramide) may have additive parasympatholytic and central nervous system-depressant effects when used in combination with thioridazine. Excessive parasympatholytic effects may include paralytic ileus, hyperthermia, mydriasis, blurred vision, tachycardia, urinary retention, psychosis, and seizures.', 'DDInter', 1767317477, 'Coadministration of thioridazine with other drugs that can prolong the QT interval is considered contraindicated.', 'Synergism', 'Coadministration of thioridazine with other drugs that can prolong the QT interval is considered contraindicated.', NULL, NULL, 'Major', 'pharmacodynamic');
