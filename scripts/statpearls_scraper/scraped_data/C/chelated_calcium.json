    "clinical_significance": "It is important for the clinician to be aware of the causes of hypercelcemia and hypocalcemia because these diseases are potentially dangerous and either extreme may be life-threatening.\n\nHypercalcemia\n\nMild hypercalcemia (less than 11.5 mg/dL) is usually asymptomatic.  Elevations of calcium above 11.5 mg/dL can lead to nonspecific symptoms including nausea, vomiting, altered mental status, headache, confusion, abdominal or flank pain, constipation, depression, weakness, myalgias, arthralgias, polyuria, polydipsia, and nocturia. Severe cases of hypercalcemia can cause coma. Physical exam findings include hypertension, bradycardia, hyperreflexia, and tongue fasciculations.\n\nThe diagnosis of hypercalcemia is divided into PTH-mediated and non-PTH-mediated causes. PTH-mediated hypercalcemia is due to increased intestinal calcium absorption in response to elevated PTH levels. Non-PTH-mediated hypercalcemia can be due to malignancy, granulomatous disorders, pharmacologic agents, endocrinopathies, and genetic causes.\n\nHypocalcemia\n\nAcute hypocalcemia (less than 8.5 mg/dL) can lead to syncope, congestive heart failure, numbness and tingling, muscle spasms and tetany, bronchospasm and wheezing, laryngospasm and dysphagia, irritability, depression, fatigue, and seizures. Chronic hypocalcemia can lead to coarse hair, brittle nails, psoriasis, dry skin, pruritus, poor dentition, and cataracts. The most common physical exam findings include neural hyperexcitability, psychological disturbances, and cardiac arrhythmias. The Chvostek and Trousseau signs are indicative of hypocalcemic states.\n\nSepsis and septic shock can cause hypocalcemia due to an unknown mechanism; patients with coexisting sepsis and hypocalcemia have higher mortality rates. A thorough medication history should be obtained to rule out hypocalcemia caused by medications such as cinacalcet, cisplatin, bisphosphonates, anticonvulsants, and denosumab.\n[8]\n\nDiagnosis\n\nThe diagnosis of hypocalcemia is first achieved by measuring serum albumin, which distinguishes true hypocalcemia from factitious hypocalcemia due to hypoalbuminemia. If albumin is normal, PTH levels should be checked to determine if the hypocalcemia is due to a disorder of PTH such as hypoparathyroidism leading to rapid hypocalcemia known as a hungry bone syndrome. If PTH levels are normal, then magnesium, vitamin D, and phosphate levels can be checked to determine if calcium levels are being affected by other electrolyte abnormalities. It is always a good idea to check kidney and liver function to determine an end-organ cause of hypocalcemia. Equally, an electrocardiogram should be ordered to assess for the effect of hypocalcemia on the heart. Radiography is often indicated to determine the etiology of chronic hypocalcemia due to disorders such as rickets or osteomalacia.\n\nLaboratory tests to determine the causes of hypercalcemia start with an albumin level and ionized calcium to confirm the hypercalcemia. Once confirmed, PTH levels should be checked to rule out hyperparathyroidism. Renal function and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) can hone in on nephrogenic and endocrine origins of hypercalcemia. Always consider electrolyte abnormalities in magnesium, vitamin D, and phosphate. An electrocardiogram may demonstrate a shortened QT interval, T wave flattening or inversion, J waves, or prolongation of the PR and QRS intervals.\n\nThe most common cause of rapidly progressive hypercalcemia is a malignancy, and patients should be evaluated radiographically for masses in the lung, breast, and kidney and have laboratory studies to evaluate for blood cancers such as multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and leukemia.\n\nTreatment\n\nThe treatment of hypercalcemia or hypocalcemia focuses on correcting the underlying disorder, which is usually causing a disturbance in calcium homeostasis. In extreme circumstances, calcium supplementation or calciuresis can correct for severe derangements in calcium levels. For milder cases, supportive measures that enhance the function of the parathyroid glands, thyroid glands, kidneys, gut, and bone will allow the body to compensate for the excess or lack of calcium and utilize internal hormonal regulatory systems to bring the calcium levels back into homeostasis.\n\nDietary Use\n\nA balanced diet includes 1000 mg of calcium daily. The intestine absorbs 200 to 400 mg of this with the rest excreted in the stool. Any excess calcium absorbed is secreted in urine. Calcium supplementation is common in elderly individuals, where it is prescribed with Vitamin D supplements to improve bone mass that is lost with increasing age.\n\nPharmacologic Use\n\nThe calcium salts of calcium chloride and calcium gluconate are administered in instances of severe hyperkalemia to stabilize the membrane potential and prevent prolonged cardiac muscle depolarization.\n[9]\n[10]"
