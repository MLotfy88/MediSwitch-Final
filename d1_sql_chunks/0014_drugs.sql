Also known as the marketed products Ritalin, Concerta, or Biphentin, methylphenidate is used with other treatment modalities (psychological, educational, cognitive behaviour therapy, etc) to improve the following group of developmentally inappropriate symptoms associated with ADHD: moderate-to-severe distractibility, short attention span, hyperactivity, emotional lability, and impulsivity. Long-acting formulations of psychostimulants such as methylphenidate, [DB01576], and [DB01255] are considered the most effective and widely used treatment for ADHD, and are considered first-line options for children, adolescents, and adults as recommended by CADDRA (Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance). [L6037] CADDRA recommends the use of methylphenidate due to long term studies, of over twenty years in duration, which show methylphenidate is safe and effective.  

While its exact mechanism is unclear, methylphenidate (MPH) has been shown to act as a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), thereby increasing the presence of these neurotransmitters in the extraneuronal space and prolonging their action.[A177541] There is a dose-related effect of psychostimulants on receptor stimulation, where higher doses are shown to increase norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) efflux throughout the brain which can result in impaired cognition and locomotor-activating effects. In contrast, low doses are found to selectively activate NE and DA neurotransmission within the prefrontal cortex which is an area of the brain thought to play a prominent role in ADHD pathophysiology, thereby improving clinical efficacy and preventing side effects.[A177547] The lower doses used to treat ADHD are not associated with the locomotor-activating effects associated with higher doses and instead reduce movement, impulsivity, and increase cognitive function including sustained attention and working memory.[A177541, A177544] Methylphenidate''s beneficial effects in sustaining attention have also been shown to be mediated by alpha-1 adrenergic receptor activity.[A177550] Clinical findings have shown that children with ADHD have an abnormality in the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1), the D4 receptor gene (DRD-4), and/or the D2 receptor gene that may be at least partly overcome by the dopaminergic effects of methylphenidate, suggesting a possible mode of action.[F4474]

When provided as Biphentin®, methylphenidate is released through a multi-layer release delivery system (MLRTM) where 40% of the dose is provided as an immediate release and 60% is provided through a gradual release. Biphentin was designed to be an alternative to separate doses of immediate-release (IR) methylphenidate by providing a biphasic concentration-time profile when given as a single dose. The MLRTM release system allows for a sustained effect for 10-12 hours, allowing for once-daily dosing that covers the major times that ADHD impairment might occur (such as school, homework periods, during the work day, etc).

When provided as Concerta®, methylphenidate is released through the patented Osmotic Controlled-Release Oral Delivery (OROS) system where 22% of the dose is provided as an immediate release and 78% is provided through a gradual release.[A631] OROS is comprised of an osmotically active trilayer core surrounded by a semipermeable membrane with an immediate-release drug overcoat. Within an aqueous environment, such as the stomach, the drug overcoat, which consists of 22% of the dose, dissolves within one hour, providing an initial immediate-release formulation of methylphenidate. Water then permeates through the membrane into the tablet core where the osmotically active polymer excipients expand, allowing methylphenidate to release slowly through the orifice over a period of 6-7 hours. Concerta also provides a sustained 10-12 hour effect, allowing for once-daily dosing.

Methylphenidate contains a blackbox warning stating that CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate-containing products and amphetamines, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. This abuse potential is likely related to the effects associated with higher doses of methylphenidate, which induce surface expression of the dopamine transporter (DAT).[A177553] In particular, increased dopamine in key brain areas is associated with the reinforcing and addictive properties of psychostimulants such as methylphenidate, and even amplifies the potency and reinforcing effects of other drugs of abuse such as amphetamines, making ADHD sufferers more susceptible to their addictive effects.[A177556] Concerns about abuse potential have spurred research into medications with fewer effects on DAT and the use of non-stimulant ADHD medications including [DB00289] and [DB01018].','["N06BA04"]','[]'),(12976,'Four vent syrup 125ml','فورفنت شراب 125 مل','24','15','Cough drugs','Bromhexine+guaifenesin+menthol+terbutaline','Medizen pharmaceutical industries','Syrup','شراب','125ml','1','1- علاج حالات الكحة المصحوبة ببلغم.','indications expectorants are drugs which have been proposed to be useful in loosening and liquefying mucous in soothing irritated bronchial mucosa and in making coughs more productive. azmaril is recommended for clinical relief of cough associated with br','6222012400447','',14414,'2024-07-25',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(12977,'Vitacid c plus 12 eff tablet','فيتاسيد سي بلس 12 قرص فوار','35','','Vitamin c','Vitamin c+zinc','Cid','Tablet','أقراص','','1','','','6221043013701','',2197,'2022-08-25',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(12978,'Dapsone 100mg 20 tab.','دابسون 100 مجم 20 قرص','158','103','Antimalarial','Dapsone','El nile.','Tab','أقراص','100mg','2','','','6221077011612','',2095,'2024-11-30',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'A sulfone active against a wide range of bacteria but mainly employed for its actions against mycobacterium leprae.

Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Rosuvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [simvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] This is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than [atorvastatin]''s effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial[A181427] concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.

Rosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]','["C10BX10", "C10BX05", "C10BX07", "C10AA07", "A10BH52", "G01AE10", "C10BX13", "C10BX09", "C10BA09", "C10BX16", "C10BX17", "C10BX14", "C10BA06"]','[]'),(12994,'Justechol 20mg 28 f.c. tablets','جستيكول 20مجم 28 قرص','212','160','Antihyperlipidemic','Rosuvastatin','Aug pharma','Tablet','أقراص','20mg','4','خافض كوليسترول','','6223005461223','',5073,'2025-03-21',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Rosuvastatin, also known as the brand name product Crestor, is a lipid-lowering drug that belongs to the statin class of medications, which are used to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and manage elevated lipid levels by inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver.

Rosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]','["C10BX10", "C10BX05", "C10BX07", "C10AA07", "A10BH52", "G01AE10", "C10BX13", "C10BX09", "C10BA09", "C10BX16", "C10BX17", "C10BX14", "C10BA06"]','[]'),(12995,'Megalase syrup 125 ml','ميجاليز شراب 125 مل','31','19.5','Anti-inflammatory - anti-edematous','Alpha amylase','Amoun','Syrup','شراب','125 ml','1','مضاد التهاب - مضاد للتورم','enzymatic preparation of anti-edematous and anti-inflammatory activity. the mode of action of alpha-amylase in inflammatory edema is characterized by: - hydrolysis with polysaccharides inflammatory exudate making it more fluid - inhibition of abnormal cap','6221025015488','',14973,'2024-11-13',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(12996,'Pridocaine cream 15 gm','بريدوكايين كريم 15 جم','32','21.5','Local anesthetic','Lidocaine+prilocaine','Global napi pharmaceuticals','Cream','كريم','15 gm','1','مخدر موضعي','','6223002143566','',12881,'2024-06-13',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'N01BB04',NULL),(12997,'Rhinex 0.05% infantile nasal drops 10 ml','رينكس 0.05% نقط أنف أطفال 10مل','18','12','Nasal congestion.adrenergic alpha-agonist','Xylometazoline','Cid','Drops','نقط','0.05%','1','مضاد للاحتقان','about xylometazoline imidazoline derivative alpha-2 adrenergic agonist topical nasal decongestant. mechanism of action of xylometazoline it is a nasal decongestant with selective alpha-2 agonistic action. it produces local vasoconstriction reduces blood f','6221043011967','',2694,'2024-07-01',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'None','[]','[]');

It also acts as an allosteric modulator of the nicotinic receptor, giving its dual mechanism of action clinical significance.[A182993]

The drug was approved by the FDA in 2001 for the treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer''s type. As Alzheimer''s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, galantamine is not known to alter the course of the underlying dementing process. Galantamine works to block the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, thereby enhancing cholinergic neuron function and signalling. Under this hypothesized mechanism of action, the therapeutic effects of galantamine may decrease as the disease progression advances and fewer cholinergic neurons remain functionally intact.[L13571] It is therefore not considered to be a disease-modifying drug.[A203558] Galantamine is marketed under the brand name Razadyne, and is available as oral immediate- and extended-release tablets and solution.[L13571]','["N06DA04"]','[]');

By inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver, statins lower abnormal cholesterol and lipid levels, and ultimately reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid. This conversion is a critical metabolic reaction involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport, including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing statins is considered standard practice for patients following any cardiovascular event, and for people who are at moderate to high risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The evidence supporting statin use, coupled with minimal side effects and long term benefits, has resulted in wide use of this medication in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Atorvastatin and other statins including [lovastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [simvastatin] are considered first-line treatment options for dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] The increasing use of this class of drugs is largely attributed to the rise in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (such as heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke) in many countries.[A181084] An elevated cholesterol level (elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in particular) is a significant risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Several landmark studies demonstrate that the use of statins is associated with both a reduction in LDL levels and CVD risk.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins were shown to reduce the incidences of all-cause mortality, including fatal and non-fatal CVD, as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Some evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within five years) statin use leads to a 20%-22% relative reduction in the number of major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

Bupropion exerts its pharmacological effects by weakly inhibiting the enzymes involved in the uptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine from the synaptic cleft, therefore prolonging their duration of action within the neuronal synapse and the downstream effects of these neurotransmitters. More specifically, bupropion binds to the norepinephrine transporter (NET) and the dopamine transporter (DAT).[A6399,A178810]

Bupropion was originally classified as an "atypical" antidepressant because it does not exert the same effects as the classical antidepressants such as Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs), Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs), or Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs). While it has comparable effectiveness to typical first-line options for the treatment of depression such as SSRIs,[A178798,A178804] bupropion is a unique option for the treatment of MDD as it lacks any clinically relevant serotonergic effects, typical of other mood medications, or any effects on histamine or adrenaline receptors.[A6399,A178840] Lack of activity at these receptors results in a more tolerable side effect profile; bupropion is less likely to cause sexual side effects, sedation, or weight gain as compared to SSRIs or TCAs, for example.[A178804,A178807]

When used as an aid to smoking cessation, bupropion is thought to confer its anti-craving and anti-withdrawal effects by inhibiting dopamine reuptake, which is thought to be involved in the reward pathways associated with nicotine, and through the antagonism of the nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptor.[A178825,A1966,A16508] A Cochrane Review of meta-analyses of available treatment modalities for smoking cessation found that abstinence rates approximately doubled when bupropion was used as compared to placebo, and was found to have similar rates of smoking cessation as [nicotine] replacement therapy (NRT).[A178816]

Bupropion is sometimes used as an add-on agent to first-line treatments of depression such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications when there is a treatment-failure or only partial response.[A178789] Bupropion is also used off-label for the management of Attention/Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults with comorbid bipolar depression to avoid mood destabilization caused by typical stimulant medications used for the treatment of ADHD.[F4624]

When used in combination with [naltrexone] in the marketed product ContraveⓇ for chronic weight management, the two components are thought to have effects on areas of the brain involved in the regulation of food intake. This includes the hypothalamus, which is involved in appetite regulation, and the mesolimbic dopamine circuit, which is involved in reward pathways.[L6562] Studies have shown that the combined activity of bupropion and [naltrexone] increase the firing rate of hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons and blockade of opioid receptor-mediated POMC auto-inhibition, which are associated with a reduction in food intake and increased energy expenditure.[L6562,A179038,A179050] The combination of naltrexone and bupropion was shown to result in a statistically significant weight loss, with a mean change in body weight of -6.3% compared to -1.3% for placebo.[A179047]','["A08AA62", "N06AX12"]','[]'),(13291,'Abstral 100mcg 10 sublingual tabs.','ابسترال 100مكجم 10 قرص تحت اللسان','1,184','','Analgesics.opioid','Fentanyl','Kyowa kirin limited > egyptian pharmaceutical trading company','Tab','أقراص','100mcg','1','','fentanyl about fentanyl citrate synthetic primary opioid agonist anilidopiperidine derivative narcotic analgesic general anesthetic. mechanism of action of fentanyl citrate this drug primarily acts on the cns. fentanyl is a pure opioid agonist and primari','','',2363,'2022-07-09',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Fentanyl, a potent opioid agonist, was developed in the 1950s to fill a need for strong and rapid analgesia.[A179542] Because of these characteristics, fentanyl is commonly used to treat chronic cancer pain or in anesthesia.[Label,L6598,L6601,L6604,L6607,L922,L6610,L6613] Fentanyl is related to other opioids like [morphine] and [oxycodone].

More specifically, folic acid is required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. Folic acid is particularly important during phases of rapid cell division, such as infancy, pregnancy, and erythropoiesis, and plays a protective factor in the development of cancer. As humans are unable to synthesize folic acid endogenously, diet and supplementation is necessary to prevent deficiencies. For example, folic acid is present in green vegetables, beans, avocado, and some fruits.[L5744]

In order to function within the body, folic acid must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted by anti-metabolite therapies such as [DB00563] as they function as DHFR inhibitors to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, and therefore prevent the formation of DHF and THF. When used in high doses such as for cancer therapy, or in low doses such as for Rheumatoid Arthritis or psoriasis, [DB00563] impedes the body''s ability to create folic acid. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects. As a result, supplementation with 1-5mg of folic acid is recommended to prevent deficiency and a number of side effects associated with MTX therapy including mouth ulcers and gastrointestinal irritation. [DB00650] (also known as folinic acid) supplementation is typically used for high-dose MTX regimens for the treatment of cancer. Levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF) and are able to bypass DHFR reduction to act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF.

There are also several antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) that are associated with reduced serum and red blood cell folate, including [DB00564] (CBZ), [DB00252] (PHT), or barbiturates.[A37004] Folic acid is therefore often provided as supplementation to individuals using these medications, particularly to women of child-bearing age. 

Inadequate folate levels can result in a number of health concerns including cardiovascular disease, megaloblastic anemias, cognitive deficiencies, and neural tube defects (NTDs).

Ergocalciferol was isolated for the first time from yeast in 1931 and its structure was elucidated in 1932.[T580]

Ergocalciferol is considered the first vitamin D analog and is differentiated from [cholecalciferol] by the presence of a double bond between C22 and C23 and the presence of a methyl group at C24. These modifications reduce the affinity of ergocalciferol for the vitamin D binding protein resulting in faster clearance, limits its activation, and alters its catabolism.[A177637]

Structurally, ergocalciferol differs from cholecalciferol in that it possesses a double bond between C22 and C23 and has an additional methyl group at C24 [L5689]. Finally, ergocalciferol is pharmacologically less potent than cholecalciferol, which makes vitamin D3 the preferred agent for medical use [L5689].

Appropriate levels of vitamin D must be upheld in the body in order to maintain calcium and phosphorus levels in a healthy physiologic range to sustain a variety of metabolic functions, transcription regulation, and bone metabolism [A223, L5689, L1782, L5771, F4027, F4042, F4048].

It is an anti-neoplastic agent used in the treatment of Hodgkin''s lymphoma and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Brentuximab vedotin was initially approved in 2011. In January 2012, the drug label was revised with a boxed warning of a condition known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and death due to opportunistic JC virus infection post treatment [L1737]. 

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Adcetris in March 2018 to treat adult patients with previously untreated stage III or IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) in combination with chemotherapy [L1737].

Adcetris has also been previously approved by the FDA to treat Hodgkin''s lymphoma after relapse, Hodgkin''s lymphoma after stem cell transplantation when a patient has a high risk of relapse or progression, systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) after the failure of other treatment regimens, and primary cutaneous ALCL after failure of other treatment regimens [L1737].

Lymphoma is a malignancy that begins in the lymphatic system, which helps to combat infection and disease. Lymphoma may begin anywhere in the body and can spread to nearby lymph nodes. The two main types of lymphoma are Hodgkin lymphoma (also called Hodgkin disease) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Most individuals with Hodgkin''s lymphoma have the classical type. In this type of lymphoma, large, abnormal lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) are found in the lymph nodes called Reed-Sternberg cells. With early diagnosis and intervention, patients with Hodgkin lymphoma normally experience long-term remission [L1737].

The ECHELON-1 study results demonstrated superior efficacy of the drug combined with a chemotherapy regimen when it is compared to the previous standard of care. Importantly, removing the drug bleomycin, a highly toxic agent, was completely removed from the regimen.

More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Rosuvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [simvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] This is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than [atorvastatin]''s effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial[A181427] concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.

Rosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]','["C10BX10", "C10BX05", "C10BX07", "C10AA07", "A10BH52", "G01AE10", "C10BX13", "C10BX09", "C10BA09", "C10BX16", "C10BX17", "C10BX14", "C10BA06"]','[]'),(13474,'Adcoclindace 10mg/30ml top. soln.','ادكوكلينداس 10مجم/30مل محلول موضعي','12','','Antibiotic.lincomycins','Clindamycin','Arab drug company.','Sol','محلول','10mg','1','','','','',947,'2022-07-23',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Clindamycin is a semi-synthetic lincosamide antibiotic used in the treatment of a variety of serious infections due to susceptible microorganisms[L11599,L11596] as well as topically for acne vulgaris.[L11593] It has a relatively narrow spectrum of activity that includes anaerobic bacteria as well as gram-positive cocci and bacilli and gram-negative bacilli.[A190621] Interestingly, clindamycin appears to carry some activity against protozoans, and has been used off-label in the treatment of toxoplasmosis, malaria, and babesiosis.[A190657]

By inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver, statins lower abnormal cholesterol and lipid levels, and ultimately reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid. This conversion is a critical metabolic reaction involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport, including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing statins is considered standard practice for patients following any cardiovascular event, and for people who are at moderate to high risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The evidence supporting statin use, coupled with minimal side effects and long term benefits, has resulted in wide use of this medication in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Atorvastatin and other statins including [lovastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [simvastatin] are considered first-line treatment options for dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] The increasing use of this class of drugs is largely attributed to the rise in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (such as heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke) in many countries.[A181084] An elevated cholesterol level (elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in particular) is a significant risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Several landmark studies demonstrate that the use of statins is associated with both a reduction in LDL levels and CVD risk.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins were shown to reduce the incidences of all-cause mortality, including fatal and non-fatal CVD, as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Some evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within five years) statin use leads to a 20%-22% relative reduction in the number of major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

Atorvastatin was first synthesized in 1985 by Dr. Bruce Roth and approved by the FDA in 1996.[T568] It is a pentasubstituted pyrrole [A177415] formed by two contrasting moieties with an achiral heterocyclic core unit and a 3,5-dihydroxypentanoyl side chain identical to its parent compound.[T571] Unlike other members of the statin group, atorvastatin is an active compound and therefore does not require activation.[A177436]','["C10BA05", "C10BX11", "C10BX12", "C10BX18", "C10AA05", "C10BX15", "C10BX03", "C10BX08", "C10BX06"]','[]'),(13513,'Adroit massage cream 100 gm','ادوريت مساج كريم 100 جم','75','','Massage','Camphor+menthol+eucalyptus+pepperment oil+stearic acid+methyl paraben','Egyptian company for cosmetics > santex pharma','Cream','كريم','100 gm','1','','indications: osteoarthritis back pain muscles pain & spasm','','',833,'2022-08-02',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(13514,'Advagraf 0.5 mg 100 prolonged r. caps.','ادفاجراف 0.5 مجم 100 كبسولات','1,440','','Immunosuppressants','Tacrolimus','Astellas > egyptian pharmaceutical trading company','Cap','كبسولة','0.5 mg','1','','about tacrolimus calcineurin inhibitor a macrolide immunosuppressant for prevention of graft rejection. mechanism of action of tacrolimus it binds to specific receptors on t cells. it reduces peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity by forming a complex with im','','',1235,'2022-07-15',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Tacrolimus (also FK-506 or Fujimycin) is an immunosuppressive drug whose main use is after organ transplant to reduce the activity of the patient''s immune system and so the risk of organ rejection.

More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Rosuvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [simvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] This is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than [atorvastatin]''s effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial[A181427] concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.

Amikacin''s unique property is that it exerts activity against more resistant gram-negative bacilli such as Acinetobacter baumanii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Semaglutide was developed by Novo Nordisk and approved by the FDA for subcutaneous injection in December 2017.[L8681] The tablet formulation was approved for oral administration in September 2019. Semaglutide works by binding to and activating the GLP-1 receptor, thereby stimulating insulin secretion and reducing blood glucose.[L8678]

The subcutaneous injection is administered once weekly and the tablet is administered once a day. Semaglutide offers a competitive advantage over other drugs used to manage diabetes, which may require several daily doses. Clinical trials have determined that this drug reduces glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels and reduces body weight, proving to be effective for patients with type 2 diabetes.[A186053] In June 2021, semaglutide was approved by the FDA for chronic weight management in adults with general obesity or overweight who have at least one weight-related condition, marking semaglutide as the first approved drug for such use since 2014.[L34485] The use of semaglutide in weight management is also approved by Health Canada [L39347] and the EMA.[L41335]','["A10BJ06"]','[]'),(13586,'Agovald 25mg 21 f.c. tabs','اجوفالد 25مجم 21 قرص','111','','Psychiatric.antidepressants','Agomelatine','Mash premiere','Tab','أقراص','25mg','3','مضاد للاكتئاب','','','',2581,'2022-06-02',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'N06AX22',NULL),(13587,'Agrelocit 50 mg 20 tab.','اجريلوسيت 50 مجم 20 قرص لعلاج الاكتئاب والتوتر','35','','Psychiatric.antidepressants','Sertraline','Memphis > atm pharmaceutical industries','Tab','أقراص','50 mg','2','','about sertraline selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (ssri) antidepressant antidepressant mechanism of action of sertraline sertraline blocks the re-uptake of neurotransmitter serotonin from the synapse in to the presynaptic nerve terminal in the cns.','','',1013,'2022-07-15',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Sertraline is a popular antidepressant medication commonly known as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and is similar to drugs such as [Citalopram] and [Fluoxetine].

The first known inhibitor of SGLTs, phlorizin, was isolated from the bark of apple trees in 1835 and researched extensively into the 20th century, but was ultimately deemed inappropriate for clinical use given its lack of specificity and significant gastrointestinal side effects.[A203501] Attempts at overcoming these limitations first saw the development of O-glucoside analogs of phlorizin (e.g. [remogliflozin etabonate]), but these molecules proved relatively pharmacokinetically unstable. The development of C-glucoside phlorizin analogs remedied the issues observed in the previous generation, and led to the FDA approval of [canagliflozin] in 2013 and both [dapagliflozin] and empagliflozin in 2014.[A203501] As the most recently approved of the "flozin" drugs, empagliflozin carries the highest selectivity for SGLT2 over SGLT1 (approximately 2700-fold). Empagliflozin was further approved by the EMA in March 2022 and Health Canada in April 2022, making it the first and only approved treatment in Europe and Canada for adults with symptomatic chronic heart failure regardless of ejection fraction.[L40783,L13916]','["A10BD19", "A10BD20", "A10BK03", "A10BD27"]','[]'),(13590,'Aig esomeprazole 40mg 28 caps.','ايه اي جي ايزوميبرازول 40مجم 28 كبسولة','292','200','Peptic ulcer.proton pump inhibitor','Esomeprazole','P & c > planet cure','Cap','كبسولة','40mg','2','قرحة المعدة والحموضة','','','',9730,'2024-06-25',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Esomeprazole, sold under the brand name Nexium, is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) medication used for the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), for gastric protection to prevent recurrence of stomach ulcers or gastric damage from chronic use of NSAIDs, and for the treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions including Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) Syndrome. It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infections along with other antibiotics including [DB01060], [DB01211], and [DB00916], for example.[A177271, F4498] Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [DB00338], [DB00213], [DB00448], [DB05351], and [DB01129]. Esomeprazole is the s-isomer of [DB00338], which is a racemate of the S- and R-enantiomer. Esomeprazole has been shown to inhibit acid secretion to a similar extent as [DB00338], without any significant differences between the two compounds _in vitro_. 

Esomeprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of esomeprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, esomeprazole''s duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]

PPIs such as esomeprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as esomeprazole has been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients such as iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]

Rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as esomeprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion.[A177574] Esomeprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing to prevent this rebound effect.','["A02BD06", "A02BC05", "M01AE52"]','[]'),(13593,'Aig minoxidil 5% scalp lotion 100 ml','ايه آي جي مينوكسيديل 5% لوسيون لفروة الشعر 100 مل','113','80','Hair regrowth.vasodilator agents','Minoxidil','Egpi > arabian international group (aig)','Lotion','لوشن','5%','1','علاج تساقط الشعر . لاعادة انبات الشعر','about minoxidil a potassium channel agonist direct-acting vasodilator hair- growth stimulant in androgenic alopecia. mechanism of action of minoxidil minoxidil works by activating pghs 1 (prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-1) which helps promote hair gro','6223003931261','',2642,'2024-12-13',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'A potent direct-acting peripheral vasodilator (vasodilator agents) that reduces peripheral resistance and produces a fall in blood pressure.','["D11AX01", "C02DC01"]','[]'),(13594,'Aimovig 70mg/ml s.c. prefilled pen 1 ml','ايموفيج 70مجم/مل اقلام للحقن تحت الجلد 1 مل','8,477','','Migraine','Erenumab','Novartis','Pen','قلم','70mg','1','منع وعلاج الصداع النصفي','indication aimovigï¿½ is indicated for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults. aimovigï¿½ selectively targets and blocks the cgrp-r disrupting a key component of migraine pathophysiology. aimovigï¿½ is available as one injection once monthly with','','',4389,'2022-12-05',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'N02CD01',NULL),(13595,'Caligina 30 tab','كاليجينا 30 قرص','65','','Calcium supplement','Calcium','Company','Tab','أقراص','','3','كالسيوم','','','',2565,'2022-06-16',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Calcium phosphate is typically available as an over the counter supplement, antacid, or as an added ingredient in some toothpastes [FDA Label] [L851].','["A12AA01", "A11GB01"]','[]'),(13596,'Sugarlo plus 50/1000mg 30 f.c. tabs','شوجارلو بلس 50/1000مجم 30 قرص','137','112.5','Anti-diabetic.combined secretagogues+sensitizers','Metformin hydrochloride+vildagliptin','Al esraa pharmaceutical optima','Tab','أقراص','1000mg','3','علاج ارتفاع مستوى السكر فى الدم','','6223004161223','',9476,'2024-06-14',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(13597,'Ajirofil anti-dandruff shampoo 125 ml','اجيروفيل شامبو ضد القشرة 125 مل','80','','Hair care','','> vitalita','Amp','أمبول','125 ml','1','','','','',918,'2022-08-05',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(13598,'Akanza liquid spray 15ml','اكانزا سبراي 15 مل','200','90','Delay action','L-arginine+menthol crystals+tea tree oil+aloe vera extract+vitamin e+vitamin c','Kato prestige > devartlab pharma','Spray','بخاخ','15ml','1','للتأخير للرجال','- akanza spray is designed and formulated to help manage male ejaculation successfully and fully. now you are able to control your penile sensitivity and perform better sexually without loss of sensation. - akanza spray is designed for all those males suf','6223006934733','',4643,'2025-03-27',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(13599,'Akenpark 2mg 20 tab.','اكينبارك 2مجم 20 قرص','10','','Antiparkinson agents. muscarinic antagonist','Biperidene','Chemipharm','Tab','أقراص','2mg','2','','','','',1296,'2022-08-27',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'N04AA02',NULL),(13600,'Restage gel 100 gm','ريستاج جل 100 جم','120','96','Analgesic and inti-inflamatory','Menthol crystal+clove oil+peppermint oil+camphor oil+vit e+paraffin oil','Italian co. for cosemetics > savi pharma','Gel','جل','100 gm','1','','fast acting pain killer with extra cooling effect anti inflammatory & anti edematous','','www.savi-pharma.com',2625,'2024-10-02',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(13601,'Faroviga 100mg 12 f.c.tab.','فاروفيجا 100مجم 12 قرص','108','70.5','Tonic for men','Sildenafil','Pharopharma','Tab','أقراص','100mg','12','','about sildenafil citrate phosphodiesterase-5 enzyme inhibitor anti-erectile dysfunction agent. mechanism of action of sildenafil citrate sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase enzyme (pde5) inhibitor. this enzyme is responsible for the degradation cyclic guano','6221094503947','',1613,'2024-09-22',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'In eliciting its mechanism of action, sildenafil ultimately prevents or minimizes the breakdown of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) by inhibiting cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The result of doing so allows cGMP present in both the penis and pulmonary vasculature to elicit smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation that subsequently facilitates relief in pulmonary arterial hypertension and the increased flow of blood into the spongy erectile tissue of the penis that consequently allows it to grow in size and become erect and rigid [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

Interestingly enough, it is precisely via this mechanism why sildenafil was at first researched as a potential treatment for angina - or chest pain associated with inadequate blood flow to the heart - before being serendipitously indicated for treating erectile dysfunction in the late 1980s [A175732]. Nevertheless, it is because of this mechanism that sildenafil is also indicated for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension but is also additionally notorious for interacting with various anti-anginal or anti-hypertensive agents to develop potentially rapid, excessive, and/or fatal hypotensive crises [A175579, A175582, A175654].

Regardless, sildenafil, among a variety of other similar or related PDE5 inhibitors, has become a common and effective treatment for erectile dysfunction and since its formal approval for medical use in the public in 1998 [A175732], continues to see millions of prescriptions written for it internationally. Although the medication has historically been most popularly recognized as Pfizer''s brand name Viagra, sildenafil is currently available generically and even as a non-prescription over the counter medication in some countries [L5656].','["G01AE10", "G04BE03"]','[]'),(13602,'Akita massage gel 50 gm','اكيتا مساج جل 50 جم','30','','Massage','Collagen','Akita pharma > dulex lab','Gel','جل','50 gm','1','كريم مساج','','','',797,'2022-05-29',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'B02BC07',NULL),(13603,'Akitalight facial cleanser 120 ml','اكيتالايت منظف للوجه 150مل','60','','Skin care','Liquorice+kojic acid+alpha arbutin+vitamin (c+b)+tea tree oil+chamomile+allantoin+glycolic acid+sali','El-helou perfumes & cosmetics > beauty & beyond international','Cleanser','منظف','120 ml','1','','','','',555,'2022-07-26',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(13604,'Limitless kids probiotic 30 chocolate balls','ليميتلس كيدز بروبيوتيك 30 قطعة شيكولاتة','290','130','Immunity booster','Probiotics','Eva pharma','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','** supports a healthy digestive & immune system ** children over 4 years old eat 1-3 chocolate balls daily preferably after meals ï- chew well do not swallow.','6223004517129','',1207,'2024-10-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(13605,'Limitless omega-3 2000 mg (per serv.) 30 caps.','ليميتلس اوميجا-3 2000مجم 30 كبسولة','230','198','','Omega 3','Eva pharma','Cap','كبسولة','2000 mg','1','','','6223012481818','http://q-r.to/Limitless-Omega-3-fish-oil',11314,'2025-05-20',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'C10AX06',NULL),(13606,'Frost max topical spray 200 ml','فروست ماكس سبراي موضعي 200 مل','220','160','','','Macro group pharmaceuticals','Spray','بخاخ','200 ml','1','مسكن لالام العضلات ومضاد للالتهابات','','6224010643147','https://prices.macro-egy.com/scan/1951',1915,'2025-01-21',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(13607,'Orgalight cream 30 sachets 5 gm','اورجالايت كريم 30 كيس 5 جم','90','','Whitening topical','Whitening formula','Hi-care > organic pharma','Cream','كريم','5 gm','1','1- تفتيح وتبييض لون البشرة .','whitening cream','','',833,'2023-04-14',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL);

Structurally, ergocalciferol differs from cholecalciferol in that it possesses a double bond between C22 and C23 and has an additional methyl group at C24 [L5689]. Finally, ergocalciferol is pharmacologically less potent than cholecalciferol, which makes vitamin D3 the preferred agent for medical use [L5689].

Aaron B. Lerner of Yale University is credited for naming the hormone and for defining its chemical structure in 1958.  In mammals, melatonin is produced by the pineal gland. The pineal gland is small endocrine gland, about the size of a rice grain and shaped like a pine cone (hence the name), that is located in the center of the brain (rostro-dorsal to the superior colliculus) but outside the blood-brain barrier. The secretion of melatonin increases in darkness and decreases during exposure to light, thereby regulating the circadian rhythms of several biological functions, including the sleep-wake cycle. In particular, melatonin regulates the sleep-wake cycle by chemically causing drowsiness and lowering the body temperature.  Melatonin is also implicated in the regulation of mood, learning and memory, immune activity, dreaming, fertility and reproduction. Melatonin is also an effective antioxidant.  Most of the actions of melatonin are mediated through the binding and activation of melatonin receptors. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may have lower than normal levels of melatonin. A 2008 study found that unaffected parents of individuals with ASD also have lower melatonin levels, and that the deficits were associated with low activity of the ASMT gene, which encodes the last enzyme of melatonin synthesis. Reduced melatonin production has also been proposed as a likely factor in the significantly higher cancer rates in night workers.','["N05CH01"]','[]'),(13639,'Alcina eye cream 15 ml (n/a)','السينا كريم العين 15 مل','185','','Eye contour','','Dr. kurt wolff > nerhadou international co.','Cream','كريم','15 ml','1','','with its innovative formula comprising the active ingredients defensilï¿½ and q10 alcina eye cream nï¿½1 provides optimal protection for the skin against harmful environmental factors and ensures beautifully bright eyes. this eye cream increases the skin','','',762,'2022-07-26',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(13640,'Deep freeze pain relief cold gel 100 gm','ديب فريز كولد جل 100 جم','280','','Analgesic','N-pentane+iso-butane+propane+n-butane+denatured ethanol+levomenthol','Mentholatum limited > egypharma','Gel','جل','100 gm','1','','','5011501013548','',3133,'2022-11-25',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(13641,'Aaa','ششش','230','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',696,'2022-12-09',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(13642,'Selenium 200mcg 90 veg caps','سيلينيوم 200مكجم 90 كبسولة','220','','Selenium','Selenium','Now foods > soficopharm','Cap','كبسولة','200mcg','1','سيلينيوم','','','',986,'2022-12-14',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Selenium is a trace metal in the human body particularly important as a component of glutathione peroxidase, an important enzyme in the prevention of cellular damage by free radicals and reactive oxygen species [FDA Label]','[]','[]'),(13643,'Aaa','ششش','105','95','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',826,'2022-12-17',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(13644,'Aldactazide 20 tab','الداكتازايد 25 مجم 20 قرص','6','','Diuretic.combined thiazide with potassium-sparing','Hydrochlorothiazide+spironolactone','Kahira > searle-canada','Tab','أقراص','','2','','about hydrochlorothiazide thiazide derivative diuretic. mechanism of action of hydrochlorothiazide it is thiazide diuretic which exerts its action by acting at site-3(central dilating segment of early distal tubule). it binds to na+cl- symporter and inhib','6221068904855','',889,'2022-12-01',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(13645,'Aaa','ششش','125','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',600,'2023-01-18',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(13646,'Physiomer baby hypertonic nasal spray 60ml','فيزيومير بيبي هايبرتونيك بخاخ للانف 60 مل','185','','Nasal decongestant','Hypertonic seawater','Laboratoire de la mer > star international company','Spray','بخاخ','60ml','1','بخاخ للانف في حالات المخاط --يساعد علي تحسين التنفس -- يساعد علي التخلص من المخاط --','*clears your toddler s nasal passages and helps restore breathing as well as comfort and wellbeing during sleeping and feeding. *in daily use: it cleanses humidifies and eliminates excess mucus - clears dust allergens pollutants and pathogens (viruses and','','',1207,'2023-07-06',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(13647,'Aldara 5% cream 12 sachets','الدارا 5% كريم 12 كيس','879','615','Immune response modifier','Imiquimod','Meda ab > multipharma','Cream','كريم','5%','1','','imiquimod cream is indicated for the topical treatment of: ï¿½ external genital and perianal warts (condylomata acuminata) in adults. ï¿½ small superficial basal cell carcinomas (sbccs) in adults. ï¿½ clinically typical nonhyperkeratotic nonhypertrophic a','','',3607,'2025-09-10',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Imiquimod is an immune response modifier that acts as a toll-like receptor 7 agonist.
