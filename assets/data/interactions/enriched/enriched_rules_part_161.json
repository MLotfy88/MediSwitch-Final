The use of idelalisib has been associated with elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal. Coadministration of ribociclib with a drug that is both a substrate as well as inhibitor of CYP450 3A4, such as idelalisib, may result in increased plasma concentrations of both drugs. Ribociclib itself is also a substrate and moderate inhibitor of CYP450 3A4. Theoretically, competitive and/or noncompetitive metabolic inhibition may occur.

Following discontinuation of the potent CYP450 3A4 inhibitor, the ribociclib dosage should be returned (after at least 5 half-lives of the inhibitor) to that used prior to initiation of the inhibitor. Likewise, clinical and/or laboratory monitoring may be appropriate for idelalisib following the addition or withdrawal of ribociclib, and the dosage adjusted as necessary. The use of idelalisib with other potentially hepatotoxic agents should be avoided whenever possible. In addition, if these agents are CYP450 3A4 inhibitors they may increase the toxicity of idelalisib. Caution is advised if coadministration is required. Patients should be closely monitored for hepatotoxicity and other toxicities of idelalisib such as diarrhea, colitis, intestinal perforation, pneumonitis, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, and the dosing adjusted or interrupted as necessary. Patients should have serum ALT, AST, and bilirubin measured prior to initiation of treatment and regularly during treatment in accordance with the product labeling. Permanent discontinuation of idelalisib is recommended in those who experience recurrent hepatotoxicity following dosage reduction.

Alternative agents with no or minimal CYP450 3A4 inhibitory potential are recommended whenever possible. If no alternatives exist, the dose of ribociclib should be reduced to 400 mg once daily. Following discontinuation of the potent CYP450 3A4 inhibitor, the ribociclib dosage should be returned (after at least 5 half-lives of the inhibitor) to that used prior to initiation of the inhibitor. In addition, ECGs should be assessed prior to initiation of treatment, during treatment when clinically necessary, and more frequently if QTcF prolongation occurs at any time during treatment. Ribociclib should be permanently discontinued if the QTcF interval prolongation is either greater than 500 msec or there is a greater than 60 msec change from baseline and associated with any of the following: Torsades de Pointes, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, unexplained syncope, or signs/symptoms of serious arrhythmia.", "mechanism_text": "Metabolism, Synergism", "recommendation": "Coadministration of ribociclib with other drugs that can prolong the QT interval and are CYP450 3A4 inhibitors should generally be avoided.", "risk_level": "Major", "type": "pharmacodynamic", "metabolism_info": null, "source_url": "https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/161367/", "reference_text": "[1] \"Product Information.

For treatment of latent tuberculosis (TB) infection, a nine-month regimen of isoniazid may be considered if feasible. For treatment of HIV-related TB, a regimen that includes rifabutin is generally preferred, as rifabutin appears to be as effective as rifampin but is a much less potent inducer of CYP450 3A4. Nonrifamycin-containing regimens may be suboptimal (higher mortality rates; higher rates of treatment failure and relapse; increased adverse effects; longer treatment duration) and are usually not recommended for HIV-related TB except in patients who are intolerant of rifamycins or infected with a rifamycin-resistant isolate. Alternatively, rifampin may be used at usual dosages in patients receiving an antiretroviral regimen that includes ritonavir 600 mg or 400 mg twice a day in combination with another PI at a reduced dosage. In patients who have not begun antiretroviral therapy at the time TB treatment is initiated, clinicians may also consider using rifampin and postponing antiretroviral therapy. With early HIV disease, it may be reasonable to monitor CD4 cell count and postpone antiretroviral therapy until TB treatment is complete, since there is low risk of HIV disease progression or death during this period. However, the optimal time for starting antiretroviral therapy should be individualized based on initial response to TB treatment and occurrence of side effects. In patients with low CD4 cell counts, clinicians may consider delaying antiretroviral therapy until after the first one or two months of TB therapy, as side effects are common during this multi-drug phase of TB treatment and may overlap with those of antiretroviral medications. Moreover, delaying antiretroviral therapy may ameliorate adherence issues and decrease the frequency and severity of paradoxical reactions (i.e., immune restoration syndromes resembling exacerbation of TB that sometimes occur after initiation of antituberculosis treatment in patients receiving potent antiretroviral therapy). Rifabutin can be substituted approximately 2 weeks before the planned initiation of antiretroviral therapy to allow time for rifampin's enzyme induction effects to wane. In general, treatment of TB in the context of antiretroviral therapy is complex and requires an individualized approach. Experts in the treatment of HIV-related tuberculosis should be consulted, and TB and HIV care providers should work in close coordination throughout treatment.", "mechanism_text": "Metabolism", "recommendation": "Given the risk of reduced viral susceptibility and resistance development associated with subtherapeutic antiretroviral drug levels, alternative antimycobacterial agents should be considered in patients already receiving effective PI-containing antiretroviral therapy.", "risk_level": "Major", "type": "pharmacodynamic", "metabolism_info": null, "source_url": "https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/161399/", "reference_text": "[1] McGregor MM, Olliaro P, Wolmarans L, Mabuza B, Bredell M, Felten MK, Fourie PB \"Efficacy and safety of rifabutin in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis.\" Am J Respir Crit Care Med 154 (1996): 1462-7[2] \"Product Information.

For treatment of latent tuberculosis (TB) infection, a nine-month regimen of isoniazid may be considered if feasible. For treatment of HIV-related TB, a regimen that includes rifabutin is generally preferred, as rifabutin appears to be as effective as rifampin but is a much less potent inducer of CYP450 3A4. Nonrifamycin-containing regimens may be suboptimal (higher mortality rates; higher rates of treatment failure and relapse; increased adverse effects; longer treatment duration) and are usually not recommended for HIV-related TB except in patients who are intolerant of rifamycins or infected with a rifamycin-resistant isolate. Alternatively, rifampin may be used at usual dosages in patients receiving an antiretroviral regimen that includes ritonavir 600 mg or 400 mg twice a day in combination with another PI at a reduced dosage. In patients who have not begun antiretroviral therapy at the time TB treatment is initiated, clinicians may also consider using rifampin and postponing antiretroviral therapy. With early HIV disease, it may be reasonable to monitor CD4 cell count and postpone antiretroviral therapy until TB treatment is complete, since there is low risk of HIV disease progression or death during this period. However, the optimal time for starting antiretroviral therapy should be individualized based on initial response to TB treatment and occurrence of side effects. In patients with low CD4 cell counts, clinicians may consider delaying antiretroviral therapy until after the first one or two months of TB therapy, as side effects are common during this multi-drug phase of TB treatment and may overlap with those of antiretroviral medications. Moreover, delaying antiretroviral therapy may ameliorate adherence issues and decrease the frequency and severity of paradoxical reactions (i.e., immune restoration syndromes resembling exacerbation of TB that sometimes occur after initiation of antituberculosis treatment in patients receiving potent antiretroviral therapy). Rifabutin can be substituted approximately 2 weeks before the planned initiation of antiretroviral therapy to allow time for rifampin's enzyme induction effects to wane. In general, treatment of TB in the context of antiretroviral therapy is complex and requires an individualized approach. Experts in the treatment of HIV-related tuberculosis should be consulted, and TB and HIV care providers should work in close coordination throughout treatment.", "mechanism_text": "Metabolism", "recommendation": "Given the risk of reduced viral susceptibility and resistance development associated with subtherapeutic antiretroviral drug levels, alternative antimycobacterial agents should be considered in patients already receiving effective PI-containing antiretroviral therapy.", "risk_level": "Major", "type": "pharmacodynamic", "metabolism_info": null, "source_url": "https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/161453/", "reference_text": "[1] McGregor MM, Olliaro P, Wolmarans L, Mabuza B, Bredell M, Felten MK, Fourie PB \"Efficacy and safety of rifabutin in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis.\" Am J Respir Crit Care Med 154 (1996): 1462-7[2] \"Product Information.

For treatment of latent tuberculosis (TB) infection, a nine-month regimen of isoniazid may be considered if feasible. For treatment of HIV-related TB, a regimen that includes rifabutin is generally preferred, as rifabutin appears to be as effective as rifampin but is a much less potent inducer of CYP450 3A4. Nonrifamycin-containing regimens may be suboptimal (higher mortality rates; higher rates of treatment failure and relapse; increased adverse effects; longer treatment duration) and are usually not recommended for HIV-related TB except in patients who are intolerant of rifamycins or infected with a rifamycin-resistant isolate. Alternatively, rifampin may be used at usual dosages in patients receiving an antiretroviral regimen that includes ritonavir 600 mg or 400 mg twice a day in combination with another PI at a reduced dosage. In patients who have not begun antiretroviral therapy at the time TB treatment is initiated, clinicians may also consider using rifampin and postponing antiretroviral therapy. With early HIV disease, it may be reasonable to monitor CD4 cell count and postpone antiretroviral therapy until TB treatment is complete, since there is low risk of HIV disease progression or death during this period. However, the optimal time for starting antiretroviral therapy should be individualized based on initial response to TB treatment and occurrence of side effects. In patients with low CD4 cell counts, clinicians may consider delaying antiretroviral therapy until after the first one or two months of TB therapy, as side effects are common during this multi-drug phase of TB treatment and may overlap with those of antiretroviral medications. Moreover, delaying antiretroviral therapy may ameliorate adherence issues and decrease the frequency and severity of paradoxical reactions (i.e., immune restoration syndromes resembling exacerbation of TB that sometimes occur after initiation of antituberculosis treatment in patients receiving potent antiretroviral therapy). Rifabutin can be substituted approximately 2 weeks before the planned initiation of antiretroviral therapy to allow time for rifampin's enzyme induction effects to wane. In general, treatment of TB in the context of antiretroviral therapy is complex and requires an individualized approach. Experts in the treatment of HIV-related tuberculosis should be consulted, and TB and HIV care providers should work in close coordination throughout treatment.", "mechanism_text": "Metabolism", "recommendation": "Given the risk of reduced viral susceptibility and resistance development associated with subtherapeutic antiretroviral drug levels, alternative antimycobacterial agents should be considered in patients already receiving effective PI-containing antiretroviral therapy.", "risk_level": "Major", "type": "pharmacodynamic", "metabolism_info": null, "source_url": "https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/161475/", "reference_text": "[1] McGregor MM, Olliaro P, Wolmarans L, Mabuza B, Bredell M, Felten MK, Fourie PB \"Efficacy and safety of rifabutin in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis.\" Am J Respir Crit Care Med 154 (1996): 1462-7[2] \"Product Information.

For treatment of latent tuberculosis (TB) infection, a nine-month regimen of isoniazid may be considered if feasible. For treatment of HIV-related TB, a regimen that includes rifabutin is generally preferred, as rifabutin appears to be as effective as rifampin but is a much less potent inducer of CYP450 3A4. Nonrifamycin-containing regimens may be suboptimal (higher mortality rates; higher rates of treatment failure and relapse; increased adverse effects; longer treatment duration) and are usually not recommended for HIV-related TB except in patients who are intolerant of rifamycins or infected with a rifamycin-resistant isolate. Alternatively, rifampin may be used at usual dosages in patients receiving an antiretroviral regimen that includes ritonavir 600 mg or 400 mg twice a day in combination with another PI at a reduced dosage. In patients who have not begun antiretroviral therapy at the time TB treatment is initiated, clinicians may also consider using rifampin and postponing antiretroviral therapy. With early HIV disease, it may be reasonable to monitor CD4 cell count and postpone antiretroviral therapy until TB treatment is complete, since there is low risk of HIV disease progression or death during this period. However, the optimal time for starting antiretroviral therapy should be individualized based on initial response to TB treatment and occurrence of side effects. In patients with low CD4 cell counts, clinicians may consider delaying antiretroviral therapy until after the first one or two months of TB therapy, as side effects are common during this multi-drug phase of TB treatment and may overlap with those of antiretroviral medications. Moreover, delaying antiretroviral therapy may ameliorate adherence issues and decrease the frequency and severity of paradoxical reactions (i.e., immune restoration syndromes resembling exacerbation of TB that sometimes occur after initiation of antituberculosis treatment in patients receiving potent antiretroviral therapy). Rifabutin can be substituted approximately 2 weeks before the planned initiation of antiretroviral therapy to allow time for rifampin's enzyme induction effects to wane. In general, treatment of TB in the context of antiretroviral therapy is complex and requires an individualized approach.
