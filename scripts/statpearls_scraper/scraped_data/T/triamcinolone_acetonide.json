    "indications": "Relative contraindications include active infection at the scar site, uncontrolled diabetes, or significant comorbid conditions that impair wound healing. Absolute contraindications include known hypersensitivity to anesthetic agents or materials required for revision and scars in areas where revision could result in significant functional compromise.\n\nAdditionally, scars located in regions with compromised vascularity or where revision poses an undue risk of functional impairment should be approached cautiously. In cases where there are unrealistic expectations or poor adherence to postoperative care instructions, scar revision may be contraindicated to prevent suboptimal outcomes.",
    "clinical_significance": "Scar revision is clinically important for improving the appearance, texture, and function of scars, ultimately enhancing patients' quality of life. In addition, it addresses both aesthetic concerns and functional limitations caused by scars from MMS. Healthcare providers can reduce scar visibility, restore skin contour, and improve scar flexibility by utilizing various scar revision techniques. In addition to cosmetic benefits, scar revision can alleviate symptoms associated with keloids or hypertrophic scars, such as itching, pain, and restricted movement."
