It also binds to glucocorticoid receptor, however compared to mifepristone (a progesterone receptor antagonist), ulipristal is more tolerable and has lower glucocorticoid activity and better binding affinity. 

Ulipristal is currently recommended as first line therapy for emergency contraception, due to improved efficacy and similar side effect profile as compared to the traditional use of levonorgestrel or the Yuzpe regimen. The exact mechanism of action for ulipristal is still currently debated, though there is evidence that it functions by inhibiting ovulation. A recent systematic review proclaimed that the majority of available evidence demonstrates an inhibitory effect on ovulation rather than a post-fertilization effect on the endometrium, which has been heavily debated due to ethical concerns related to abortion (Rosato et al, 2016). Nevertheless, current and ongoing research into the agent''s mechanism of action as an emergency contraceptive continue to provide potentially plausible evidence that ulipristal may, in fact, elicit activity on the endometrium that prevents embryo implantation [A175372, A175375, A175378].','["G03AD02", "G03XB02"]','[]'),(19764,'Gesto 30 capsules','جيستو 30 كبسولة','26','','Git disturbances','Peppermint oil+ginger oil+chamomile oil+fennel oil+caraway oil','Arab caps > napco','Capsule','كبسولة','','3','','improve gastro-intestinal functions','','',864,'2022-07-22',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(19766,'Gevarcut 200 mg 10 f.c. tabs.','جيفاركوت 200 مجم 10 أقراص','13','','Anti-ischemic','Naftidrofuryl','El-obour > repharma pharmaceuticals','Tab','أقراص','200 mg','1','','naftidrofuryl oxalate works in two main ways. firstly it causes the blood vessels to widen. secondly it increases the ability of cells to remove waste products. in peripheral vascular diseases the blood vessels in the extremities are narrowed and the bloo','','',1172,'2022-07-09',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'C04AX21',NULL),(19767,'Giga white cream 50 gm','جيجا وايت 50جم كريم','70','','Whitening topical','','El-helou perfumes & cosmetics > four benifits pharmaceuticals','Cream','كريم','50 gm','1','كريم تفتيح وترطيب البشرة وعلاج الكلف والتصبغات','whitening cream','','',1683,'2022-07-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(19768,'Gigazocin 200mg/5ml pd. oral susp. 25 ml','جيجازوسين 200 مجم / 5 مل معلق 25 مل','17','','Antibiotic.macrolide','Azithromycin','T3a pharma > pioneer pharmaceutical industries','Susp','معلق','200mg','1','','description: azithromycin is a semi-synthetic macrolide antibiotic of the azalide class. dose: adult: po- respiratory tract skin and soft tissue infections- 500 mg once daily for 3 days. or 500mg on day 1 followed by 250mg on days 2 to 5. typhoid- 500 mg','','',783,'2022-07-25',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Azithromycin is a broad-spectrum macrolide antibiotic with a long half-life and a high degree of tissue penetration [A174172].

Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder with increasing prevalences worldwide; it is characterized by insulin resistance in accordance with progressive β cell failure and long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications that lead to co-morbidities and mortalities. Sulfonylureas are one of the insulin secretagogues widely used for the management of type 2 diabetes to lower blood glucose levels. The main effect of SUs is thought to be effective when residual pancreatic β-cells are present,[A177715] as they work by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreatic beta cells and they are also thought to exert extra-pancreatic effects, such as increasing the insulin-mediated peripheral glucose uptake.[A177709] 

Glimepiride works by stimulating the secretion of insulin granules from pancreatic islet beta cells by blocking ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATPchannels) and causing depolarization of the beta cells. Compared to [glipizide], another second SU drug, glimepiride has a longer duration of action. It is sometimes classified as a third-generation SU because it has larger substitutions than other second-generation SUs.[A177703] Compared to other SUs, glimepiride was associated with a lower risk of developing hypoglycemia and weight gain in clinical trials [A177709] as well as fewer cardiovascular effects than other SUs due to minimal effects on ischemic preconditioning of cardiac myocytes.[A177703] It is effective in reducing fasting plasma glucose, postprandial glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin levels and is considered to be a useful, cost-effective treatment option for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus.[A177703] Glimepiride was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States in 1995 for the treatment of T2DM.

Empagliflozin was further approved by the EMA in March 2022 and Health Canada in April 2022, making it the first and only approved treatment in Europe and Canada for adults with symptomatic chronic heart failure regardless of ejection fraction.[L40783,L13916]','["A10BD19", "A10BD20", "A10BK03", "A10BD27"]','[]'),(19849,'Glinta cream 60 gm','جلينتا كريم 60 جم','120','100','Whitening topical','','Hi-care > roventis pharma','Cream','كريم','60 gm','1','كريم تفتيح.','*** indications markedly reduces and treats different skin hyperpigmentation disorders as: -post-inflammatory hyper pigmentation after peeling or laser sessions. -dark skin or tanning. -melasma/cholasma. -freckles. ***directions for use apply suitable amo','','',1370,'2025-01-02',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(19850,'Glipicrone 80mg 20 tab.','جليبيكرون 80 مجم 20 قرص','8','','Anti-diabetic.secretagogues.sulfonylurea','Gliclazide','Amriya','Tab','أقراص','80mg','2','','about gliclazide first generation sulfonylurea oral antidiabetic agent. mechanism of action of gliclazide it is an antidiabetic drug which exerts it`s action by increasing insulin release from the pancreas and by improving glucose tolerance. it acts on th','6221075010259','',751,'2022-12-05',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'A10BB09',NULL),(19851,'Glipizide-cid 5 mg 20 tab.','جليبيزيد سيد 5 مجم 20 قرص','11','','Anti-diabetic.secretagogues.sulfonylurea','Glipizide','Cid','Tab','أقراص','5 mg','2','علاج مرضى السكري','','6223000011140','',1286,'2022-05-27',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Glipizide is an oral hypoglycemic agent in the second-generation sulfonylurea drug class that is used to control blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

interconvert _in vivo_ with little consequence.[L11416] The thiazolidinedione class of medications, which also includes [rosiglitazone] and [troglitazone], exerts its pharmacological effect primarily by promoting insulin sensitivity and the improved uptake of blood glucose[L11416] via agonism at the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ).[A19757] PPARs are ligand-activated transcription factors that are involved in the expression of more than 100 genes and affect numerous metabolic processes, most notably lipid and glucose homeostasis.[A19759]

Thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone, have fallen out of favor in recent years due to the presence of multiple adverse effects and warnings regarding their use (e.g. congestive heart failure, bladder cancer) and the availability of safer and more effective alternatives for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.[L11461]','["A10BD09", "A10BG03", "A10BD05", "A10BD06", "A10BD12"]','[]'),(19863,'Glivec 100mg 120 caps','جليفيك 100مجم 120 كبسولة','11,750','','Tyrosine- kinase inhibitor','Imatinib','Novartis','Cap','كبسولة','100mg','12','','','','',1914,'2022-04-06',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Imatinib is a small molecule kinase inhibitor that revolutionized the treatment of cancer, particularly chronic myeloid leukemia, in 2001.[A249305] It was deemed a "miracle drug" due to its clinical success, as oncologist Dr. Brian noted that "complete hematologic responses were observed in 53 of 54 patients with CML treated with a daily dosage of 300 mg or more and typically occurred in the first four weeks of therapy".[A249315].

Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder with increasing prevalences worldwide; it is characterized by insulin resistance in accordance with progressive β cell failure and long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications that lead to co-morbidities and mortalities. Sulfonylureas are one of the insulin secretagogues widely used for the management of type 2 diabetes to lower blood glucose levels. The main effect of SUs is thought to be effective when residual pancreatic β-cells are present,[A177715] as they work by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreatic beta cells and they are also thought to exert extra-pancreatic effects, such as increasing the insulin-mediated peripheral glucose uptake.[A177709] 

Glimepiride works by stimulating the secretion of insulin granules from pancreatic islet beta cells by blocking ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATPchannels) and causing depolarization of the beta cells. Compared to [glipizide], another second SU drug, glimepiride has a longer duration of action. It is sometimes classified as a third-generation SU because it has larger substitutions than other second-generation SUs.[A177703] Compared to other SUs, glimepiride was associated with a lower risk of developing hypoglycemia and weight gain in clinical trials [A177709] as well as fewer cardiovascular effects than other SUs due to minimal effects on ischemic preconditioning of cardiac myocytes.[A177703] It is effective in reducing fasting plasma glucose, postprandial glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin levels and is considered to be a useful, cost-effective treatment option for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus.[A177703] Glimepiride was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States in 1995 for the treatment of T2DM. It is commonly marketed under the brand name Amaryl as oral tablets and is typically administered once daily.','["A10BD04", "A10BB12",

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as sofosbuvir. As a prodrug nucleotide analog, Sofosbuvir is metabolized into its active form as the antiviral agent 2''-deoxy-2''-α-fluoro-β-C-methyluridine-5''-triphosphate (also known as GS-461203), which acts as a defective substrate for NS5B (non-structural protein 5B) [synthesis]. NS5B, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is essential for the transcription of Hepatitis C viral RNA and for its high replicative rate and genetic diversity [A19594]. Sofosbuvir and other direct acting antivirals are therefore very potent options for the treatment of Hepatitis C, as they exhibit a high barrier to the development of resistance [A19593]. This is an important advantage relative to HCV drugs that target other viral enzymes such as the protease, for which rapid development of resistance has proven to be an important cause of therapeutic failure.  

In a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend Sofosbuvir as first line therapy in combination with other antivirals for all six genotypes of Hepatitis C [L852]. Depending on the genotype, sofosbuvir is often used in combination with other antivirals such as [DB09027], [DB11613], [DB09102], [DB06290], [DB11574], [DB11575], [DB00811], [DB00008], or [DB00022] with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626]. Treatment with direct acting antivirals such as sofosbuvir is associated with very minimal side effects, with the most common being headache and fatigue [FDA Label]. Lack of significant side effects and short duration of therapy is a considerable advantage over older interferon- and ribavirin-based regimens, which were limited by infusion site reactions, reduced blood count, and neuropsychiatric effects [A19635]. 

Since 2014, sofosbuvir has been available as a fixed dose combination product with [DB09027] (tradename Harvoni) used for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C. Approved in October 2014 by the FDA, Harvoni is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1, 4, 5, and 6 with or without [DB00811] depending on the level of liver damage or cirrhosis [FDA Label].  When combined together, ledipasvir and sofosbuvir as the combination product Harvoni has been shown to achieve a SVR between 93 and 99% after 12 weeks of treatment [A7535]. Its use has also proven successful in the treatment of HCV in patients co-infected with HIV [A19627].

Sofosbuvir is also available as a fixed dose combination product with [DB11613] as the commercially available product Epclusa. First approved in June 2016, Epclusa is the first combination HCV product indicated for the treatment of all genotypes of Hepatitis C with or without cirrhosis. Epclusa is also currently the most potent HCV antiviral medication on the market with a sustained virologic response (SVR) after 12 weeks of therapy of 93-99% depending on genotype and level of cirrhosis [L852]. Both Canadian and American guidelines list Epclusa as a first line recommendation for all genotypes of HCV [L852, A19626].

Notably, sofosbuvir has come under intense scrutiny since its release to market in 2013. With the price per pill set at $1000, a 12-week treatment can cost upwards of $84,000 per patient [A19636].','["J05AP08", "J05AP51", "J05AP55", "J05AP56"]','[]'),(20056,'Gratisovir 400mg 28 tablets','جراتيسوفير 400 مجم 28 قرص','900','','Antiviral','Sofosbuvir','European egyptian pharm. ind. > pharco','Tablet','أقراص','400mg','4','','indications and usage: it is a hepatitis c virus (hcv) nucleotide analog ns5b polymerase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c (chc) infection as a component of a combination antiviral treatment regimen. *efficacy has been establish','6221151003205','',2565,'2022-07-17',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Sofosbuvir (tradename Sovaldi) is a direct acting antiviral medication used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic Hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV).

The first known inhibitor of SGLTs, phlorizin, was isolated from the bark of apple trees in 1835 and researched extensively into the 20th century, but was ultimately deemed inappropriate for clinical use given its lack of specificity and significant gastrointestinal side effects.[A203501] Attempts at overcoming these limitations first saw the development of O-glucoside analogs of phlorizin (e.g. [remogliflozin etabonate]), but these molecules proved relatively pharmacokinetically unstable. The development of C-glucoside phlorizin analogs remedied the issues observed in the previous generation, and led to the FDA approval of [canagliflozin] in 2013 and both [dapagliflozin] and empagliflozin in 2014.[A203501] As the most recently approved of the "flozin" drugs, empagliflozin carries the highest selectivity for SGLT2 over SGLT1 (approximately 2700-fold). Empagliflozin was further approved by the EMA in March 2022 and Health Canada in April 2022, making it the first and only approved treatment in Europe and Canada for adults with symptomatic chronic heart failure regardless of ejection fraction.[L40783,L13916]','["A10BD19", "A10BD20", "A10BK03", "A10BD27"]','[]'),(20078,'Aaa','ششش','7','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',760,'2022-07-17',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(20079,'Growth formula for kids 10 sachets 330 gm - banana','جروث فورميلا للاطفال 10 اكياس 330 جم بالموز','230','184.5','Dietary supplement','Skimmed milk+whey protein+maltodextrine+sucrose+sodium caseinate+natural flavour','Bio pharma egypt','Sachet','أكياس','330 gm','1','','available in 4 flavors: vanilla | chocolate | strawberry | banana indications: -protein-calorie malnutrition. -decreased oral intake. -delayed growth in children. -underweight children. *dosage: - 1-3 years : 1 tablespoonful to 1 cup of milk or water twic','285602663017','',1156,'2024-09-26',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(20080,'Growth formula for kids 250 gm powder','جروث فورميلا للاطفال 250 جم باودر','70','','Dietary supplement','Skimmed milk+whey protein+maltodextrine+sucrose+sodium caseinate+natural flavour','Bio pharma egypt','Powder','بودرة','250 gm','1','','available in 4 flavors: vanilla | chocolate | strawberry | banana indications: -protein-calorie malnutrition. -decreased oral intake. -delayed growth in children. -underweight children. *dosage: - 1-3 years : 1 tablespoonful to 1 cup of milk or water twic','','',886,'2023-05-01',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(20081,'Growth formula for kids 400 gm pd. - banana','جروث فورميولا للاطفال 400 جرام باودر بالموز','250','194.5','Dietary supplement','Skimmed milk+whey protein+maltodextrine+sucrose+sodium caseinate+natural flavour','Bio pharma egypt','Unknown','غير محدد','400 gm','1','','available in 4 flavors: vanilla | chocolate | strawberry | banana indications: -protein-calorie malnutrition. -decreased oral intake. -delayed growth in children. -underweight children. *dosage: - 1-3 years : 1 tablespoonful to 1 cup of milk or water twic','6223002630851','',1015,'2024-09-26',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(20082,'Growth formula for kids 7 sachets 231 gm','جروث فورميلا للاطفال 7 اكياس 231 جم','35','','Dietary supplement','Skimmed milk+whey protein+maltodextrine+sucrose+sodium caseinate+natural flavour','Bio pharma egypt','Sachet','أكياس','231 gm','1','مكمل غذائي للاطفال لامدادهم بالمعادن و الفيتامينات التي يحتاجها جسمهم','available in 4 flavors: vanilla | chocolate | strawberry | banana indications: -protein-calorie malnutrition. -decreased oral intake. -delayed growth in children. -underweight children. *dosage: - 1-3 years : 1 tablespoonful to 1 cup of milk or water twic','','',772,'2023-05-01',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(20083,'Gatyxel eye ointment 5 gm','جاتيكسيل مرهم عين 5 جم','26','','Antibiotic.quinolone','Gatifloxacin','Orchidia pharmaceutical industries','Ointment','مرهم','5 gm','1','','','6223005443274','',1035,'2024-05-28',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Gatifloxacin is an antibiotic agent and a member of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolone family.

Haloperidol is indicated for the treatment of the manifestations of several psychotic disorders including schizophrenia, acute psychosis, Tourette syndrome, and other severe behavioural states.[F4645] It is also used off-label for the management of chorea associated with Huntington''s disease and for the treatment of intractable hiccups as it is a potent antiemetic. Dopamine-antagonizing medications such as haloperidol are though to improve psychotic symptoms and states that are caused by an over-production of dopamine, such as schizophrenia, which is theorized to be caused by a hyperdopaminergic state within the limbic system of the brain.[A34360]

Use of the first-generation antipsychotics (including haloperidol) is considered highly effective for the management of the "positive" symptoms of schizophrenia including hallucinations, hearing voices, aggression/hostility, disorganized speech, and psychomotor agitation. However, this class of drugs is also limited by the development of movement disorders induced by dopamine-blockade such as drug-induced parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, tardive dyskinesia, as well as other side effects including sedation, weight gain, and prolactin changes. While there are limited high-quality studies comparing haloperidol to lower-potency first-generation antipsychotics such as [DB00477], [DB01624], [DB00623], and [DB01403], haloperidol typically demonstrates the least amount of side effects within this class, but demonstrates a stronger disposition for causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).[A180613, A180616, A180625] These other low‐potency antipsychotics are limited by their lower affinity for dopamine receptors, which requires a higher dose to effectively treat symptoms of schizophrenia. In addition, they block many receptors other than the primary target (dopamine receptors), such as cholinergic or histaminergic receptors, resulting in a higher incidence of side effects such as sedation, weight gain, and hypotension.

Interestingly, in vivo pharmacogenetic studies have demonstrated that the metabolism of haloperidol may be modulated by genetically determined polymorphic _CYP2D6_ activity. However, these findings contradict the findings from studies in vitro with human liver microsomes and from drug interaction studies in vivo. Inter-ethnic and pharmacogenetic differences in haloperidol metabolism may possibly explain these observations.[A32346]

However, this class of drugs is also limited by the development of movement disorders induced by dopamine-blockade such as drug-induced parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, tardive dyskinesia, as well as other side effects including sedation, weight gain, and prolactin changes. While there are limited high-quality studies comparing haloperidol to lower-potency first-generation antipsychotics such as [DB00477], [DB01624], [DB00623], and [DB01403], haloperidol typically demonstrates the least amount of side effects within this class, but demonstrates a stronger disposition for causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).[A180613, A180616, A180625] These other low‐potency antipsychotics are limited by their lower affinity for dopamine receptors, which requires a higher dose to effectively treat symptoms of schizophrenia. In addition, they block many receptors other than the primary target (dopamine receptors), such as cholinergic or histaminergic receptors, resulting in a higher incidence of side effects such as sedation, weight gain, and hypotension.

Interestingly, in vivo pharmacogenetic studies have demonstrated that the metabolism of haloperidol may be modulated by genetically determined polymorphic _CYP2D6_ activity. However, these findings contradict the findings from studies in vitro with human liver microsomes and from drug interaction studies in vivo. Inter-ethnic and pharmacogenetic differences in haloperidol metabolism may possibly explain these observations.[A32346]

First-generation antipsychotic drugs have largely been replaced with second- and third-generation (atypical) antipsychotics such as [DB00734], [DB00334], [DB00363], [DB01224], [DB01238], and [DB00246]. However, haloperidol use remains widespread and is considered the benchmark for comparison in trials of the newer generation antipsychotics.[A180625]

The efficacy of haloperidol was first established in controlled trials in the 1960s.[A180610]','["N05AD01"]','[]');

Felodipine is used to treat mild to moderate essential hypertension.','["C07FB02", "C08CA02", "C09BB05"]','[]'),(20282,'Healthpoint nappy cream 100 gm','هيلث بوينت نابي كريم 100 جم','70','','Diaper rash','Water+zinc oxide+liquid paraffin+lanolin+cetearyl alcohol+glyceryl stearate+benzyl alcohol+peg-100 s','Healthpoint ltd. > paxton','Cream','كريم','100 gm','1','علاج التهابات الحفاضات','composition: water + zinc oxide + liquid paraffin + lanolin + cetearyl alcohol + glyceryl stearate + benzyl alcohol + peg-100 stearate + phenoxyethanol + hydroxyl ethyl cellulose + parfum + ethylhexylglycerin','','',685,'2022-08-17',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(20283,'Healthpoint zinc & castor cream 225 gm','هيلث بوينت كريم الزنك وزيت الخروع 225 جم','150','','Soothing topical','Water+cetearyl alcohol+liquid paraffin+glyceryl stearate+zinc oxide+petrolatum+ricinus communis (cas','Healthpoint ltd. > paxton','Cream','كريم','225 gm','1','','composition: water + cetearyl alcohol + liquid paraffin + glyceryl stearate + zinc oxide + petrolatum + ricinus communis (castor) oil + peg-100 stearate + phenoxyethanol + parfum + ethylhexylglycerin','','',926,'2022-07-09',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(20284,'Healthtadine 10 mg 10 tabs.','هيلثتادين 10 مجم 10 أقراص','26','','Antihistamine.second-generation','Rupatadine','Pharmed healthcare','Tab','أقراص','10 mg','1','','rupatadine fumarate has been approved for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria in adults and children over 12 years. the defined daily dose (ddd) is 10 mg orally.','6224007433133','',841,'2022-07-29',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'R06AX28',NULL),(20285,'Healthy diet 12 teabags','هيلثي دايت 12 كيس شاي','30','25','Weight loss','Green coffee+green tea+garcinia cambogia+moringa','Medcare > explore pharm','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','-you do not need to add sugar. -put the teabag in a cup of boiling water stir well.','','',1155,'2023-08-15',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(20286,'Heamotron syrup 120 ml','هيموترون شراب 120 مل','19','','Multivitamins','Minerals+vitamins','El-obour > aromied pharmaceutials','Syrup','شراب','120 ml','1','','','6224007331170','',978,'2023-04-26',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(20287,'Aaa','ششش','10','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',600,'2022-08-03',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(20288,'Heat comfort cream 50 gm','هيت كومفورت كريم 50جم','16','','Analgesic','Eucalyptus oil+menthol+methyl salicylate+terpentine oil','El nile.','Cream','كريم','50 gm','1','','about menthol terpenes and terpenoid antipruritic decongestant topical analgesic. mechanism of action of menthol menthol acts as a local anesthetic on the respiratory passageways and causing cough suppression. when menthol is rubbed on the skin it acts as','','',597,'2022-08-03',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(20289,'Heatapsin 0.025% cream 30 gm','هيتاسبين 0.25% كريم 30 جم','9','','Topical analgesic','Capsaicin','Jedco int. co. for pharmaceuticals','Cream','كريم','0.025%','1','مسكن موضعي','about capsaicin a lipophilic capsaicinoid(methyl vanillyl nonenamide) substance p release inducer a topical analgesic antineuralgic and antipruritic rubefacient. mechanism of action of capsaicin capsaicin is a rubefacient. it produces reddening of the ski','','',1044,'2022-06-02',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'M02AB',NULL),(20291,'Fulphila 6 mg/0.6 ml s.c. pref. syringe','فولفيلا 6 مجم 0.6مل سرنجة معبأة','4,706','3222','Colony stimulating factor','Pegfilgrastim','One pharma medics','Syringe','حقنة','6 mg','1','','','','',1101,'2025-08-23',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Pegfilgrastim is a PEGylated form of the recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) analogue, [filgrastim].[A187601] The drug is approved for use to decrease the incidence of infection, as manifested by febrile neutropenia, in susceptible patients with with non-myeloid cancer receiving myelosuppressive anti-cancer treatment.[L9746] Although the risk of developing febrile neutropenia is less than 20% in many readily used chemotherapy regimens,[A248855] infections pose risks of hospitalization and mortalities.[A187631] Due to the relatively short circulating half-life of filgrastim, a 20 kDa PEG moiety was covalently conjugated to the N-terminus of filgrastim (at the methionine residue) to develop longer-acting pegfilgrastim.[A29,A187607] Due to a longer half-life and slower elimination rate than filgrastim, pegfilgrastim requires less frequent dosing than filgrastim; however, pegfilgrastim has a comparable pharmacological activity to filgrastim and binds to the G-CSF receptor to stimulate the proliferation, differentiation, and activation of neutrophils.[A187607]

Vitamin D3 and D2 require hydroxylation in order to become biologically active in the human body. Since vitamin D can be endogenously synthesized in adequate amounts by most mammals exposed to sufficient quantities of sunlight, vitamin D functions like a hormone on vitamin D receptors to regulate calcium in opposition to parathyroid hormone.

It is primarily indicated for use in treating hepatitis C and viral hemorrhagic fevers. HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. It is reported that ribavirin might be only effective in early stages of viral hemorrhagic fevers including Lasser fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever, and Hantavirus infection. Ribavirin is a prodrug that is metabolized into nucleoside analogs that blocks viral RNA synthesis and viral mRNA capping. Before the development of newer drugs, ribavirin and [DB00008]/[DB00022] dual therapy was considered the first-generation and standard antiviral treatment [A19626]. The dual therapy was administered for 48 weeks in patients with genotype 1, 4, 5, and 6, and 24 weeks in patients with genotype 2 and 3 [A19626]. Newer drugs developed as Hepatitis C viral infection treatments can be used to reduce or eliminate the use of ribavirin, which are associated with serious adverse effects. They also improve therapeutic efficacy in patients with failed [DB00008]/[DB00022] and ribavirin-based therapy. The potential use of ribavirin as a treatment for acute myeloid leukemia is currently under investigation.

According to 2017 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and 2015 consensus guidelines from the Canadian Association for the Study of the Liver (CASL), ribavirin is typically used as an adjunct therapy to various first-line and second-line combination therapies recommended for each genotypes. Ribavirin is added to decrease relapse rates by accelerating viral clearance early in the treatment course [A19645]. When used to treat Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, it is always used as a part of combination therapies as ribavirin monotherapy is not efficacious in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection [A19644]. Additionally, including ribavirin in the regimen can increase the risk of anemia. 

In HCV genotye 1/2/3/4/5/6 patients, ribavirin can be used in combination therapy involving [DB09102] and [DB08934], Eplusa ([DB08934], [DB11613]), Harvoni ([DB08934], [DB09027]), [DB06290] and [DB08934], Viekira Pak ([DB09296], [DB09297], [DB00503], [DB09183]), Technivie ([DB00503], [DB09296], [DB09297]) and Zepatier ([DB11574], [DB11575]). Addition of weight-based ribavirin to Technivie therapy increased sustained virologic response after 12 weeks of daily therapy (SVR12) from 90% to 97% in patients with HCV genotype 1a and 90.9% to 100% in HCV genotype 4 patients [L852]. Zepatier therapy along with ribavirin improved SVR in HCV genotype 5 patients. Combination therapy of ribavirin and [DB00008] results in the SVR of 44% in patients with genotype 1 infection and 70% in patients with genotype 2-6. The inclusion of ribavirin in the combination therapies depend on individual patient''s profile, for example if HCV genotype 3 patient has a Y93H genetic variant and compensated cirrhosis.','["J05AP01"]','[]'),(20362,'Hepavax-gene 10mcg vial','هيبافاكس جين 10 ميكروجرام فيال','15','','Vaccine','Vaccine hepatitis b','Koria green cross > eimc','Vial','فيال','10mcg','1','','','','',1138,'2022-07-22',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(20363,'Hepaverin 200mg 170 caps.','هيبافيرين 200 مجم 170 كبسولة','244','','Antiviral.nucleoside','Ribavirin','Amriya','Cap','كبسولة','200mg','1','','about ribavirin a nucleoside antimetabolite triazole derivative antiviral. mechanism of action of ribavirin ribavirin is a nucleoside analogue and it is phosphorylated by adenosine kinase enzyme in the host cell to form ribavirin monophosphate.this will i','','',893,'2022-07-18',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Producing a broad-spectrum activity against several RNA and DNA viruses, Ribavirin is a synthetic guanosine nucleoside and antiviral agent that interferes with the synthesis of viral mRNA.

They also improve therapeutic efficacy in patients with failed [DB00008]/[DB00022] and ribavirin-based therapy. The potential use of ribavirin as a treatment for acute myeloid leukemia is currently under investigation.

According to 2017 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and 2015 consensus guidelines from the Canadian Association for the Study of the Liver (CASL), ribavirin is typically used as an adjunct therapy to various first-line and second-line combination therapies recommended for each genotypes. Ribavirin is added to decrease relapse rates by accelerating viral clearance early in the treatment course [A19645]. When used to treat Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, it is always used as a part of combination therapies as ribavirin monotherapy is not efficacious in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection [A19644]. Additionally, including ribavirin in the regimen can increase the risk of anemia. 

In HCV genotye 1/2/3/4/5/6 patients, ribavirin can be used in combination therapy involving [DB09102] and [DB08934], Eplusa ([DB08934], [DB11613]), Harvoni ([DB08934], [DB09027]), [DB06290] and [DB08934], Viekira Pak ([DB09296], [DB09297], [DB00503], [DB09183]), Technivie ([DB00503], [DB09296], [DB09297]) and Zepatier ([DB11574], [DB11575]). Addition of weight-based ribavirin to Technivie therapy increased sustained virologic response after 12 weeks of daily therapy (SVR12) from 90% to 97% in patients with HCV genotype 1a and 90.9% to 100% in HCV genotype 4 patients [L852]. Zepatier therapy along with ribavirin improved SVR in HCV genotype 5 patients. Combination therapy of ribavirin and [DB00008] results in the SVR of 44% in patients with genotype 1 infection and 70% in patients with genotype 2-6. The inclusion of ribavirin in the combination therapies depend on individual patient''s profile, for example if HCV genotype 3 patient has a Y93H genetic variant and compensated cirrhosis.','["J05AP01"]','[]'),(20364,'Hepsera 10mg 30 tab.','هيبسيرا 10 مجم 30 قرص','520','','Antiviral.nucleoside','Adefovir','Glaxo smithkline','Tab','أقراص','10mg','3','','about adefovir antiretroviral agent reverse transcriptase inhibitor (nucleoside) mechanism of action of adefovir adefovir undergoes phosphorylation in the presence of cellular kinase enzyme to adefovir diphosphate. this adefovir diphosphate competitively','','',912,'2022-07-24',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'J05AF08',NULL),(20365,'Hepta 150mg/ml oral drops 10 ml','هيبتا 150 مجم / مل نقط فموية 10 مل','4','','Orthostatic hypotension','Heptaminol','Alexandria','Drops','نقط','150mg','1','','description of heptaminol heptaminol: an amino alcohol that has been used as a myocardial stimulant and vasodilator and to relieve bronchospasm. its most common therapeutic use is in orthostatic hypotension. the mechanism of heptaminol s therapeutic actio','','',1216,'2022-07-12',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'C01DX08',NULL),(20366,'Hepta yeast 30 tabs','حبوب الخميرة 30 قرص','69','','Multivitamins','Yeast','Technomed pharma','Tab','أقراص','','1','مكمل غذائى يعمل على الحفاظ على صحة الجلد، والشعر، والعينين، والفم.الحفاظ على صحة الجهاز العصبي.','','','',7276,'2022-07-24',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'V01AA04',NULL),(20367,'Heptaminol 150mg 20 tabs.','هيبتامينول 150مجم 20 قرص','8','','Orthostatic hypotension','Heptaminol','Alexandria','Tab','أقراص','150mg','2','','description of heptaminol heptaminol: an amino alcohol that has been used as a myocardial stimulant and vasodilator and to relieve bronchospasm. its most common therapeutic use is in orthostatic hypotension. the mechanism of heptaminol s therapeutic actio','','',1194,'2022-07-10',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'C01DX08',NULL),(20368,'Herasera serum 75 ml','هيرا سيرا سيروم للشعر 75 مل','120','','Hair care','Caffeine+hydrolyzed keratin+silicon+dimethiconol+amodimethicone+linseed+grape seed+aloe vera oil','Dreams > drug pharma egypt','Serum','سيروم','75 ml','1','','','','',922,'2022-08-02',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'A06AC05',NULL),(20370,'Herba care cream 50 gm','هيربا كير كريم 50 جم','35','','Hair care','Saga oil+juniper oil+carrot oil+linseed oil+sesame oil+sunflower oil+almond oil+aloe vera extract+ca','Egpi > herba pharm','Cream','كريم','50 gm','1','غنى غنى بالفيتامينات لترميم وتقوية بصيلات الشعر ومنع التساقط والهيشان','special formula for hair growth','','',750,'2022-08-02',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(20371,'Aaa','ششش','22','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',828,'2022-07-25',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(20372,'Herbal bronch n syrup 120 ml','هيربال برونش إن شراب 120 مل','75','50','Cough drugs','Tincture primula root+tincture thyme+tincutre pimpinella+tincture grindelia+tincture tilia','Hochster pharmaceutical industries','Syrup','شراب','120 ml','1','مكمل غذائي مهدئ للسعال والكحة','dietary supplement of cough. herbal bronch is a natural syrup tinctures of natural herbs which herbs which help to reduce bronchial secretions and relief or reduce symptoms of bronchial asthma. * dosage adults : one tablespoonful three times daily. childr','6224007751282','',2825,'2024-08-08',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(20373,'Herbal laxative 100 caps.

It is suggested that the overexpression or gene amplification of HER2 has been found in about 20–30% of breast cancers and elevated activation of HER2 triggers multiple downstream pathways leading to abnormal proliferation of cancer cells [A121]. Trastuzumab binds to HER2 and suppresses cancer cell growth, proliferation, and survival directly and indirectly [A121].

In December 2017, FDA approved OGIVRI (trastuzumab-dkst) as a biosimilar to Herceptin (trastuzumab) for the treatment of patients with breast or metastatic stomach cancer (gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma) whose tumors overexpress the HER2 gene (HER2+). It displays biosimilar properties as Herceptin according to clinical data.
