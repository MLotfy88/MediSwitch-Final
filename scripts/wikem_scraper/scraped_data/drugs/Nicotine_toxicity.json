      "text": "Nicotine is an alkaloid. Alkaloids are a group of compounds that are typically produced by plants to discourage animals from eating them.\nNicotine commonly comes from the tobacco plant\nThere are 66 other plants from which nicotine can be obtained.\nThese plants are apart of the nightshade family (include eggplant, tomato, potato, green pepper)\nFree-base nicotine is used as an insecticide since it is highly poisonous and reactive with oxygen and other chemicals, destroying cells and tissues.",
