Ordinarily a prompt diuresis ensues. If needed, the same dose can be administered 6 to 8 hours later or the dose may be increased. The dose may be raised by 20 or 40 mg and given not sooner than 6 to 8 hours after the previous dose until the desired diuretic effect has been obtained. The individually determined single dose should then be given once or twice daily (e.g., at 8 am and 2 pm). The dose of furosemide may be carefully titrated up to 600 mg/day in patients with clinically severe edematous states. Edema may be most efficiently and safely mobilized by giving furosemide on 2 to 4 consecutive days each week.When doses exceeding 80 mg/day are given for prolonged periods, careful clinical observation and laboratory monitoring are particularly advisable. (See PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests.)Geriatric patients -- In general, dose selection for the elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use).Pediatric Patients -- The usual initial dose of oral furosemide in pediatric patients is 2 mg/kg body weight, given as a single dose. If the diuretic response is not satisfactory after the initial dose, dosage may be increased by 1 or 2 mg/kg no sooner than 6 to 8 hours after the previous dose. Doses greater than 6 mg/kg body weight are not recommended. For maintenance therapy in pediatric patients, the dose should be adjusted to the minimum effective level.

(2.1) •Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Reserve titration to higher doses of oxycodone HCl tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. (2.1, 5) •Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. (2.1) •Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient’s underlying case and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. (2.1, 5.1) •Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with oxycodone HCl tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments. (2.1, 5.2) •Discuss availability of naloxone with the patient and caregiver and assess each patient’s need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with oxycodone HCl tablets. Consider prescribing naloxone based on the patient’s risk factors for overdose. (2.2, 5.1, 5.2 , 5.3) •Initiate treatment with oxycodone HCl tablets in a dosing range of 5 to 15 mg every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia.

The maximum dose should not exceed 400 mcg per day. If the 400 mcg dose is used, it may be given either as a once a day dosage (4 sprays in each nostril) or divided into two daily doses of two sprays/nostril twice a day. The nasal spray pump must be primed before AllerNaze is used for the first time. To prime the pump, press down on the shoulder of the white nasal applicator using your forefinger and middle finger while supporting the base of the bottle with your thumb. Press down and release the pump until it sprays 3 times or until a fine mist is observed (see DIRECTIONS FOR USE ). Some patients may obtain relief of symptoms sooner when started on a 400 mcg per day dose of AllerNaze than with 200 mcg per day. Onset of significant relief of nasal symptoms was seen within two days after starting treatment at 400 mcg once daily. A starting dose of 400 mcg per day may be considered in patients when starting therapy with AllerNaze in cases where a faster onset of relief is desirable. Generally, maximum relief of symptoms may take several days or up to one week to occur. After symptoms have been brought under control, patients should be titrated to the minimum effective dose to reduce the possibility of adverse effects. If relief of symptoms is not achieved after 14-21 days of AllerNaze therapy given in an adequate dose, AllerNaze should be discontinued and alternative diagnosis and therapies considered. AllerNaze is not recommended for use in persons under 12 years of age since its safety and effectiveness have not been established in this age group.

The patient’s dose should be carefully adjusted to a point where the suppression of tics and the relief afforded is balanced against the untoward side effects of the drug. An ECG should be done at baseline and periodically thereafter, especially during the period of dose adjustment (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS - Laboratory Tests). Periodic attempts should be made to reduce the dosage of pimozide tablets, USP to see whether or not tics persist at the level and extent first identified. In attempts to reduce the dosage of pimozide tablets, USP consideration should be given to the possibility that increases of tic intensity and frequency may represent a transient, withdrawal related phenomenon rather than a return of disease symptoms. Specifically, one to two weeks should be allowed to elapse before one concludes that an increase in tic manifestations is a function of the underlying disease syndrome rather than a response to drug withdrawal. A gradual withdrawal is recommended in any case. Children Reliable dose response data for the effects of pimozide tablets, USP on tic manifestation in Tourette’s Disorder patients below the age of twelve are not available. Treatment should be initiated at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg preferably taken once at bedtime. The dose may be increased every third day to a maximum of 0.2 mg/kg not to exceed 10 mg/day. At doses above 0.05 mg/kg/day, CYP 2D6 genotyping should be performed. In poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers, pimozide tablets, USP doses should not exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day, and doses should not be increased earlier than 14 days (see PRECAUTIONS – Pharmacogenomics). Adults In general, treatment with pimozide tablets, USP should be initiated with a dose of 1 to 2 mg a day in divided doses. The dose may be increased thereafter every other day.

The injection is especially useful for psychotic patients with acute dystonic reactions or other reactions that make oral medication difficult or impossible. It is recommended also when a more rapid response is desired than can be obtained with the tablets. Because of cumulative action, therapy should be initiated with a low dose which is increased gradually at five or six-day intervals to the smallest amount necessary for optimal relief. Increases should be made in increments of 0.5 mg, to a maximum of 6 mg, or until optimal results are obtained without excessive adverse reactions. Postencephalitic and Idiopathic Parkinsonism The usual daily dose is 1 to 2 mg, with a range of 0.5 to 6 mg orally or parenterally. As with any agent used in parkinsonism, dosage must be individualized according to age and weight, and the type of parkinsonism being treated. Generally, older patients, and thin patients cannot tolerate large doses. Most patients with postencephalitic parkinsonism need fairly large doses and tolerate them well. Patients with a poor mental outlook are usually poor candidates for therapy. In idiopathic parkinsonism, therapy may be initiated with a single daily dose of 0.5 to 1 mg at bedtime. In some patients, this will be adequate; in others 4 to 6 mg a day may be required. In postencephalitic parkinsonism, therapy may be initiated in most patients with 2 mg a day in one or more doses. In highly sensitive patients, therapy may be initiated with 0.5 mg at bedtime, and increased as necessary. Some patients experience greatest relief by taking the entire dose at bedtime; others react more favorably to divided doses, two to four times a day. Frequently, one dose a day is sufficient, and divided doses may be unnecessary or undesirable.

Daily dosage can be increased to 10, 20 and then to 40 mg in single or divided doses if required for optimum blood pressure control. The effective dosage range is usually 10 to 40 mg per day. The maximum recommended dosage is 100 mg per day. Patients under 12 years of age: The initial dosage is 0.2 mg/kg minoxidil as a single daily dose. The dosage may be increased in 50 to 100% increments until optimum blood pressure control is achieved. The effective dosage range is usually 0.25 to 1 mg/kg/day. The maximum recommended dosage is 50 mg daily (see 9. Pediatric Use under PRECAUTIONS). Dose frequency: The magnitude of within-day fluctuation of arterial pressure during therapy with minoxidil is directly proportional to the extent of pressure reduction. If supine diastolic pressure has been reduced less than 30 mm Hg, the drug need be administered only once a day; if supine diastolic pressure has been reduced more than 30 mm Hg, the daily dosage should be divided into two equal parts. Frequency of dosage adjustment: Dosage must be titrated carefully according to individual response. Intervals between dosage adjustments normally should be at least 3 days since the full response to a given dose is not obtained for at least that amount of time. Where a more rapid management of hypertension is required, dose adjustments can be made every 6 hours if the patient is carefully monitored. Concomitant therapy: Diuretic and beta-blocker or other sympathetic nervous system suppressant. Diuretics: Minoxidil must be used in conjunction with a diuretic in patients relying on renal function for maintaining salt and water balance.

As with all antipsychotic drugs, dosage should be individualized according to the needs and response of each patient. Dosage adjustments, either upward or downward, should be carried out as rapidly as practicable to achieve optimum therapeutic control. To determine the initial dosage, consideration should be given to the patient’s age, severity of illness, previous response to other antipsychotic drugs, and any concomitant medication or disease state. Children, debilitated or geriatric patients, as well as those with a history of adverse reactions to antipsychotic drugs, may require less haloperidol. The optimal response in such patients is usually obtained with more gradual dosage adjustments and at lower dosage levels, as recommended below. Clinical experience suggests the following recommendations: Oral Administration Inital Dosage Range Adults Moderate Symptomatology - 0.5 mg to 2 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. Severe Symptomatology - 3 mg to 5 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. To achieve prompt control, higher doses may be required in some cases. Geriatric or Debilitated Patients - 0.5 mg to 2 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. Chronic or Resistant Patients - 3 mg to 5 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. Patients who remain severely disturbed or inadequately controlled may require dosage adjustment. Daily dosages up to 100 mg may be necessary in some cases to achieve an optimal response. Infrequently haloperidol has been used in doses above 100 mg for severely resistant patients; however the limited clinical usage has not demonstrated the safety of prolonged administration of such doses. Children The following recommendations apply to children between the ages of 3 and 12 years (weight range 15 kg to 40 kg). Haloperidol is not intended for children under 3 years old.

Use the smallest dosage necessary to achieve the required response. Adults For EdemaThe usual adult dosage is 25 to 100 mg daily as a single or divided dose. Many patients with edema respond to intermittent therapy, i.e., administration on alternate days or on three to five days each week. With an intermittent schedule, excessive response and the resulting undesirable electrolyte imbalance are less likely to occur.For Control of HypertensionThe usual initial dose in adults is 25 mg daily given as a single dose. The dose may be increased to 50 mg daily, given as a single or two divided doses. Doses above 50 mg are often associated with marked reductions in serum potassium (see also PRECAUTIONS).Patients usually do not require doses in excess of 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide daily when used concomitantly with other antihypertensive agents.

The usual starting dose of losartan potassium tablets is 50 mg once daily, with 25 mg used in patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g., patients treated with diuretics) (see WARNINGS, Hypotension — Volume-Depleted Patients) and patients with a history of hepatic impairment (see PRECAUTIONS, General). Losartan potassium tablets can be administered once or twice daily with total daily doses ranging from 25 mg to 100 mg. If the antihypertensive effect measured at trough using once-a-day dosing is inadequate, a twice-a-day regimen at the same total daily dose or an increase in dose may give a more satisfactory response. The effect of losartan is substantially present within one week but in some studies the maximal effect occurred in 3-6 weeks (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects, Hypertension).

Dosage should then be adjusted according to blood pressure response at peak (2 to 6 hours) and trough (about 24 hours after dosing) blood levels. The usual dosage range needed to maintain a response at trough is 20 to 40 mg but some patients appear to have a further response to 80 mg. In some patients treated with once daily dosing, the antihypertensive effect may diminish toward the end of the dosing interval. If trough response is inadequate, dividing the daily dose should be considered. If blood pressure is not adequately controlled with fosinopril sodium alone, a diuretic may be added. Concomitant administration of fosinopril sodium with potassium supplements, potassium salt substitutes, or potassium-sparing diuretics can lead to increases of serum potassium (see PRECAUTIONS ). In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic hypotension occasionally can occur following the initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets. To reduce the likelihood of hypotension, the diuretic should, if possible, be discontinued two to three days prior to beginning therapy with fosinopril sodium tablets (see WARNINGS ). Then, if blood pressure is not controlled with fosinopril sodium tablets alone diuretic therapy should be resumed. If diuretic therapy cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 10 mg of fosinopril sodium tablets should be used with careful medical supervision for several hours and until blood pressure has stabilized. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and Drug Interactions ). Since concomitant administration of fosinopril sodium tablets with potassium supplements, or potassium containing salt substitutes or potassium-sparing diuretics may lead to increases in serum potassium, they should be used with caution (see PRECAUTIONS ).

With an intermittent schedule, excessive response and the resulting undesirable electrolyte imbalance are less likely to occur.For Control of HypertensionThe usual initial dose in adults is 25 mg daily given as a single dose. The dose may be increased to 50 mg daily, given as a single or two divided doses. Doses above 50 mg are often associated with marked reductions in serum potassium (see also PRECAUTIONS).Patients usually do not require doses in excess of 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide daily when used concomitantly with other antihypertensive agents.

If symptoms occur only intermittently or at specific times of the day, use of metoclopramide in single doses up to 20 mg prior to the provoking situation may be preferred rather than continuous treatment. Occasionally, patients (such as elderly patients) who are more sensitive to the therapeutic or adverse effects of metoclopramide will require only 5 mg per dose. Experience with esophageal erosions and ulcerations is limited, but healing has thus far been documented in one controlled trial using q.i.d. therapy at 15 mg per dose, and this regimen should be used when lesions are present, so long as it is tolerated (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Because of the poor correlation between symptoms and endoscopic appearance of the esophagus, therapy directed at esophageal lesions is best guided by endoscopic evaluation. Therapy longer than 12 weeks has not been evaluated and cannot be recommended. For the Relief of Symptoms Associated with Diabetic Gastroparesis (Diabetic Gastric Stasis): Administer 10 mg of metoclopramide 30 minutes before each meal and at bedtime for two to eight weeks, depending upon response and the likelihood of continued well-being upon drug discontinuation. The initial route of administration should be determined by the severity of the presenting symptoms. If only the earliest manifestations of diabetic gastric stasis are present, oral administration of metoclopramide may be initiated.

Dosage may be increased by 0.25 mg twice weekly up to a dosage of 1 mg twice a week according to the patient's serum prolactin level. Before initiating treatment, cardiovascular evaluation should be performed and echocardiography should be considered to assess for valvular disease. Dosage increases should not occur more rapidly than every 4 weeks, so that the physician can assess the patient's response to each dosage level. If the patient does not respond adequately, and no additional benefit is observed with higher doses, the lowest dose that achieved maximal response should be used and other therapeutic approaches considered. Patients receiving long term treatment with Cabergoline should undergo periodic assessment of their cardiac status and echocardiography should be considered. After a normal serum prolactin level has been maintained for 6 months, cabergoline may be discontinued, with periodic monitoring of the serum prolactin level to determine whether or when treatment with cabergoline should be reinstituted. The durability of efficacy beyond 24 months of therapy with cabergoline has not been established.

JANUVIA can be taken with or without food. 2.2 Patients with Renal Insufficiency For patients with mild renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance [CrCl] ≥50 mL/min, approximately corresponding to serum creatinine levels of ≤1.7 mg/dL in men and ≤1.5 mg/dL in women), no dosage adjustment for JANUVIA is required. For patients with moderate renal insufficiency (CrCl ≥30 to <50 mL/min, approximately corresponding to serum creatinine levels of >1.7 to ≤3.0 mg/dL in men and >1.5 to ≤2.5 mg/dL in women), the dose of JANUVIA is 50 mg once daily.

JANUVIA may be administered without regard to the timing of hemodialysis. Because there is a need for dosage adjustment based upon renal function, assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiation of JANUVIA and periodically thereafter. Creatinine clearance can be estimated from serum creatinine using the Cockcroft-Gault formula.

Use the smallest dosage necessary to achieve the required response. Adults For EdemaThe usual adult dosage is 25 to 100 mg daily as a single or divided dose. Many patients with edema respond to intermittent therapy, i.e., administration on alternate days or on three to five days each week. With an intermittent schedule, excessive response and the resulting undesirable electrolyte imbalance are less likely to occur.For Control of HypertensionThe usual initial dose in adults is 25 mg daily given as a single dose. The dose may be increased to 50 mg daily, given as a single or two divided doses. Doses above 50 mg are often associated with marked reductions in serum potassium (see also PRECAUTIONS).Patients usually do not require doses in excess of 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide daily when used concomitantly with other antihypertensive agents. Infants and Children For Diuresis and For Control of HypertensionThe usual pediatric dosage is 0.5 to 1 mg per pound (1 to 2 mg/kg) per day in single or two divided doses, not to exceed 37.5 mg per day in infants up to 2 years of age or 100 mg per day in children 2 to 12 years of age.

ABRAXANE has different dosage and administration instructions from other paclitaxel products. Closely monitor the infusion site for extravasation or drug infiltration during administration. Limiting the infusion of ABRAXANE to 30 minutes may reduce the risk of infusion-related reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

The patient’s fasting blood glucose and HbA1c must be measured periodically to determine the minimum effective dose for the patient; to detect primary failure, i.e., inadequate lowering of blood glucose at the maximum recommended dose of medication; and to detect secondary failure, i.e., loss of adequate blood glucose lowering response after an initial period of effectiveness. Glycosylated hemoglobin levels should be performed to monitor the patient’s response to therapy. Short-term administration of glimepiride may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control in patients usually controlled well on diet and exercise. Usual Starting Dose The usual starting dose of glimepiride tablets USP as initial therapy is 1 to 2 mg once daily, administered with breakfast or the first main meal. Those patients who may be more sensitive to hypoglycemic drugs should be started at 1 mg once daily, and should be titrated carefully. (See PRECAUTIONS Section for patients at increased risk.) No exact dosage relationship exists between glimepiride and the other oral hypoglycemic agents. The maximum starting dose of glimepiride tablets USP should be no more than 2 mg. Failure to follow an appropriate dosage regimen may precipitate hypoglycemia. Patients who do not adhere to their prescribed dietary and drug regimen are more prone to exhibit unsatisfactory response to therapy. Usual Maintenance Dose The usual maintenance dose is 1 to 4 mg once daily. The maximum recommended dose is 8 mg once daily. After reaching a dose of 2 mg, dosage increases should be made in increments of no more than 2 mg at 1 to 2 week intervals based upon the patient’s blood glucose response.

If abnormal, use caution when treating with pioglitazone tablets, investigate the probable cause, treat (if possible) and follow appropriately. Monitoring liver tests while on pioglitazone tablets is not recommended in patients without liver disease. (5.3) 2.1 Recommendations for All Patients Pioglitazone tablets should be taken once daily and can be taken without regard to meals. The recommended starting dose for patients without congestive heart failure is 15 mg or 30 mg once daily. The recommended starting dose for patients with congestive heart failure (NYHA Class I or II) is 15 mg once daily. The dose can be titrated in increments of 15 mg up to a maximum of 45 mg once daily based on glycemic response as determined by HbA1c. After initiation of pioglitazone tablets or with dose increase, monitor patients carefully for adverse reactions related to fluid retention such as weight gain, edema, and signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Liver tests (serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) should be obtained prior to initiating pioglitazone tablets.

Blood pressure response is dose related over the range of 2 to 32 mg. The usual recommended starting dose of ATACAND is 16 mg once daily when it is used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume depleted. ATACAND can be administered once or twice daily with total daily doses ranging from 8 mg to 32 mg. Larger doses do not appear to have a greater effect, and there is relatively little experience with such doses. Most of the antihypertensive effect is present within 2 weeks, and maximal blood pressure reduction is generally obtained within 4 to 6 weeks of treatment with ATACAND. Use in Hepatic Impairment: Initiate with 8 mg ATACAND in patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency. Dosing recommendations cannot be provided for patients with severe hepatic insufficiency [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. ATACAND may be administered with or without food. If blood pressure is not controlled by ATACAND alone, a diuretic may be added.

For most patients, the recommended starting dose is 5 mg once daily, with or without food, as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure, the dose can be increased at 2-week intervals up to 40 mg. A more frequent dosing regimen is unlikely to be beneficial. Renal Impairment In patients with severe renal impairment (ClCr less than 30 mL/min) the recommended initial dose is 2.5 mg once daily; titrate up slowly if needed.

Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, the recommended initial dose is 2.5 mg once daily; titrate up slowly if needed.

Do not use diluents containing calcium, such as Ringer's solution or Hartmann's solution, to reconstitute ceftriaxone for injection vials or to further dilute a reconstituted vial for IV administration because a precipitate can form. Precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium can also occur when ceftriaxone for injection is mixed with calcium-containing solutions in the same IV administration line. Ceftriaxone for injection must not be administered simultaneously with calcium-containing IV solutions, including continuous calcium-containing infusions such as parenteral nutrition via a Y-site. However, in patients other than neonates, ceftriaxone for injection and calcium-containing solutions may be administered sequentially of one another if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid (see WARNINGS). There have been no reports of an interaction between ceftriaxone and oral calcium-containing products or interaction between intramuscular ceftriaxone and calcium-containing products (IV or oral). NEONATES: Hyperbilirubinemic neonates, especially prematures, should not be treated with ceftriaxone for injection (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Ceftriaxone for injection is contraindicated in neonates if they require (or are expected to require) treatment with calcium-containing IV solutions, including continuous calcium-containing infusions such as parenteral nutrition because of the risk of precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Recommended Dosage: •ALL: 20 mg/m2 one time weekly (2.2). •pJIA: Starting dose of 10 mg/m2 one time weekly (2.3). 2.1 Important Administration Information XATMEP is intended for oral use only. Use another formulation of methotrexate for alternative dosing in patients who require dosing via other routes of administration. Instruct patients and caregivers that the recommended dose should be taken weekly, as directed, and that mistaken daily use of the recommended dose has led to fatal toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.15 ), Overdosage (10)]. It is important that XATMEP be measured with an accurate measuring device [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.15 ), Patient Counseling Information (17)]. A household teaspoon is not an accurate measuring device. A pharmacist can provide an appropriate device and can provide instructions for measuring the correct dose. 2.2 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia The recommended starting dose of XATMEP, in multi-agent combination chemotherapy maintenance regimens, is 20 mg/m2 given one time weekly. After initiating XATMEP, continuation of appropriate dosing requires periodic monitoring of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and platelet count to assure sufficient drug exposure (that is to maintain ANC at a desirable level) and to adjust for excessive hematological toxicity. 2.3 Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis The recommended starting dose of XATMEP is 10 mg/m2 given one time weekly. Dosages should be tailored to the individual patient and adjusted gradually to achieve an optimal response.

The tablets should be taken intact; they should not be chewed, crushed, or broken. The suggested total daily dose ranges between 3 to 6 mg/day. Dosage should be individualized for maximum beneficial effect. While the suggested total daily dosages given will meet the needs of most patients, there will be some patients who require doses greater than 6 mg/day. In such cases, dosage should be increased cautiously to avoid adverse effects. Dosing in Special Populations In elderly patients, in patients with advanced liver disease, or in patients with debilitating disease, the usual starting dose of alprazolam extended-release tablets is 0.5 mg once daily. This may be gradually increased if needed and tolerated (see Dose Titration). The elderly may be especially sensitive to the effects of benzodiazepines. Dose Titration Treatment with alprazolam extended-release tablets may be initiated with a dose of 0.5 mg to 1 mg once daily. Depending on the response, the dose may be increased at intervals of 3 to 4 days in increments of no more than 1 mg/day. Slower titration to the dose levels may be advisable to allow full expression of the pharmacodynamic effect of alprazolam extended-release tablets. Generally, therapy should be initiated at a low dose to minimize the risk of adverse responses in patients especially sensitive to the drug. Dose should be advanced until an acceptable therapeutic response (i.e., a substantial reduction in or total elimination of panic attacks) is achieved, intolerance occurs, or the maximum recommended dose is attained. Dose Maintenance In controlled trials conducted to establish the efficacy of alprazolam extended-release tablets in panic disorder, doses in the range of 1 to 10 mg/day were used.

Begin dosing at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability.

Although LYRICA was also studied at 600 mg/day, there is no evidence that this dose confers additional significant benefit and this dose was less well tolerated.

In situations of less severity, lower doses will generally suffice, while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisolone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy.IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT.After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small increments at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisolone for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. Alternate-Day Therapy Alternate-Day Therapy is a corticosteroid dosing regimen in which twice the usual daily dose of corticoid is administered every other morning. The purpose of this mode of therapy is to provide the patient requiring long-term pharmacologic dose treatment with the beneficial effects of corticoid",General,DailyMed,0,,,

(2.1) Children undergoing cardio-pulmonary bypass should receive an additional dose of Synagis as soon as possible after the cardio-pulmonary bypass procedure (even if sooner than a month from the previous dose). Thereafter, doses should be administered monthly as scheduled. (2.1, 12.3) 2.1 Dosing Information The recommended dose of Synagis is 15 mg per kg of body weight given monthly by intramuscular injection. The first dose of Synagis should be administered prior to commencement of the RSV season and the remaining doses should be administered monthly throughout the RSV season. Children who develop an RSV infection should continue to receive monthly doses throughout the RSV season. In the northern hemisphere, the RSV season typically commences in November and lasts through April, but it may begin earlier or persist later in certain communities. Synagis serum levels are decreased after cardio-pulmonary bypass [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Children undergoing cardio-pulmonary bypass should receive an additional dose of Synagis as soon as possible after the cardio-pulmonary bypass procedure (even if sooner than a month from the previous dose). Thereafter, doses should be administered monthly as scheduled. The efficacy of Synagis at doses less than 15 mg per kg, or of dosing less frequently than monthly throughout the RSV season, has not been established. 2.2 Administration Instructions DO NOT DILUTE THE PRODUCT.

Striant® should be placed in a comfortable position just above the incisor tooth (on either side of the mouth). With each application, Striant® should be rotated to alternate sides of the mouth. Upon opening the packet, the rounded side surface of the buccal system should be placed against the gum and held firmly in place with a finger over the lip and against the product for 30 seconds to ensure adhesion. Striant® is designed to stay in position until removed. If the buccal system fails to properly adhere to the gum or should fall off during the 12-hour dosing interval, the old buccal system should be removed and a new one applied. If the buccal system falls out of position within 4 hours prior to the next dose, a new buccal system should be applied and it may remain in place until the time of next regularly scheduled dosing. Patients should take care to avoid dislodging the buccal system. Patients should check to see if Striant® is in place following toothbrushing, use of mouthwash and consumption of food or alcoholic/non-alcoholic beverages.

TPMT genotyping or phenotyping can be used to identify patients with absent or reduced TPMT activity. Patients with low or absent TPMT activity are at an increased risk of developing severe, life-threatening myelotoxicity from azathioprine tablets if conventional doses are given. Physicians may consider alternative therapies for patients who have low or absent TPMT activity (homozygous for non-functional alleles). Azathioprine tablets should be administered with caution to patients having one non-functional allele (heterozygous) who are at risk for reduced TPMT activity that may lead to toxicity if conventional doses are given. Dosage reduction is recommended in patients with reduced TPMT activity. Early drug discontinuation may be considered in patients with abnormal CBC results that do not respond to dose reduction. Renal Homotransplantation The dose of azathioprine tablets required to prevent rejection and minimize toxicity will vary with individual patients; this necessitates careful management. The initial dose is usually 3 to 5 mg/kg daily, beginning at the time of transplant. Azathioprine tablets are usually given as a single daily dose on the day of, and in a minority of cases 1 to 3 days before, transplantation. Azathioprine is often initiated with the intravenous administration of the sodium salt, with subsequent use of tablets (at the same dose level) after the postoperative period. Intravenous administration of the sodium salt is indicated only in patients unable to tolerate oral medications. Dose reduction to maintenance levels of 1 to 3 mg/kg daily is usually possible. The dose of azathioprine tablets should not be increased to toxic levels because of threatened rejection.

Initial dosing is generally 2 mg/day. Dose increases should then occur at intervals not less than 24 hours, in increments of 1 to 2 mg/day, as tolerated, to a recommended dose of 4 to 8 mg/day. In some patients, slower titration may be appropriate. Efficacy has been demonstrated in a range of 4 to 16 mg/day [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. However, doses above 6 mg/day for twice daily dosing were not demonstrated to be more efficacious than lower doses, were associated with more extrapyramidal symptoms and other adverse effects, and are generally not recommended. In a single study supporting once-daily dosing, the efficacy results were generally stronger for 8 mg than for 4 mg. The safety of doses above 16 mg/day has not been evaluated in clinical trials. Maintenance TherapyWhile it is unknown how long a patient with schizophrenia should remain on risperidone, the effectiveness of risperidone 2 mg/day to 8 mg/day at delaying relapse was demonstrated in a controlled trial in patients who had been clinically stable for at least 4 weeks and were then followed for a period of 1 to 2 years[see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment with an appropriate dose.

Adenosine Injection should be given as a rapid bolus by the peripheral intravenous route. To be certain the solution reaches the systemic circulation, it should be administered either directly into a vein or, if given into an IV line, it should be given as close to the patient as possible and followed by a rapid se flush. Adult Patients The dose recommendation is based on clinical studies with peripheral venous bolus dosing. Central venous (CVP or other) administration of adenosine has not been systematically studied. The recommended intravenous doses for adults are as fo Initial dose: 6 mg given as a rapid intravenous bolus (administered over a 1 to 2 second pe Repeat administration: If the first dose does not result in elimination of the supraventricular tachycardia within 1 to 2 minutes, 12 mg should be given as a rapid intravenous bolus. This 12 mg dose may be repeated a second time if required. Pediatric Patients The dosages used in neonates, infants, children and adolescents were equivalent to those administered to adults on a weight basis. Pediatric Patients with a Body Weight < 50 kg: Initial dose: Give 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg as a rapid IV bolus given either centrally or peripherally. A saline flush should follow. Repeat administration: If conversion of PSVT does not occur within 1 to 2 minutes, additional bolus injections of adenosine can be administered at incrementally higher doses, increasing the amount given by 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg. Follow each bolus with a saline flush. This process should continue until sinus rhythm is established or a maximum single dose of 0.3 mg/kg is used.

Dosage of metformin must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance, while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily doses. The maximum recommended daily dose of metformin is 2550 mg in adults and 2000 mg in pediatric patients (10-16 years of age).Metformin should be given in divided doses with meals and should be started at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation, both to reduce gastrointestinal side effects and to permit identification of the minimum dose required for adequate glycemic control of the patient.During treatment initiation and dose titration (see Recommended Dosing Schedule), fasting plasma glucose should be used to determine the therapeutic response to metformin and identify the minimum effective dose for the patient. Thereafter, glycosylated hemoglobin should be measured at intervals of approximately three months. The therapeutic goal should be to decrease both fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels to normal or near normal by using the lowest effective dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets, either when used as monotherapy or in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin.Monitoring of blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin will also permit detection of primary failure, i.e., inadequate lowering of blood glucose at the maximum recommended dose of medication, and secondary failure, i.e., loss of an adequate blood glucose lowering response after an initial period of effectiveness.Short-term administration of metformin may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control in patients usually well-controlled on diet alone.

Follow-up cultures should be obtained from the original site(s) of infection 7 to 14 days after therapy. In women, it is also desirable to obtain culture test-of-cure from both the endocervical and anal canals. Prolonged intensive therapy is needed for complications such as prostatitis and epididymitis. For respiratory tract infections, the usual dose is 250 mg qid in equally spaced doses. CHILDREN WEIGHING 20 KG OR LESS: For genitourinary or gastrointestinal tract infections, the usual dose is 100 mg/kg/day total, qid in equally divided and spaced doses. For respiratory infections, the usual dose is 50 mg/kg/day total, in equally divided and spaced doses three to four times daily. Doses for children should not exceed doses recommended for adults. ALL PATIENTS, IRRESPECTIVE OF AGE AND WEIGHT: Larger doses may be required for severe or chronic infections. Although ampicillin is resistant to degradation by gastric acid, it should be administered at least one-half hour before or two hours after meals for maximal absorption. Except for the single dose regimen for gonorrhea referred to above, therapy should be continued for a minimum of 48 to 72 hours after the patient becomes asymptomatic or evidence of bacterial eradication has been obtained. In infections caused by hemolytic strains of streptococci, a minimum of 10 days’ treatment is recommended to guard against the risk of rheumatic fever of glomerulonephritis (see PRECAUTIONS–Labo",General,DailyMed,1,,,Oral

Patients requiring large LDL-C reduction (>45%) may start at 40 mg once daily (2.1). Pediatric starting dose: 10 mg once daily; maximum recommended dose: 20 mg once daily (2.2). 2.1 Hyperlipidemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb) The recommended starting dose of LIPITOR is 10 or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDL-C (more than 45%) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of LIPITOR is 10 to 80 mg once daily. LIPITOR can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. The starting dose and maintenance doses of LIPITOR should be individualized according to patient characteristics such as goal of therapy and response (see current NCEP Guidelines). After initiation and/or upon titration of LIPITOR, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly. 2.2 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (10–17 years of age) The recommended starting dose of LIPITOR is 10 mg/day; the maximum recommended dose is 20 mg/day (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy [see current NCEP Pediatric Panel Guidelines, Clinical Pharmacology (12) , and Indications and Usage (1.2) ]. Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more. 2.3 Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia The dosage of LIPITOR in patients with homozygous FH is 10 to 80 mg daily. LIPITOR should be used as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable. 2.4 Concomitant Lipid-Lowering Therapy LIPITOR may be used with bile acid resins.

The patient’s dose should be carefully adjusted to a point where the suppression of tics and the relief afforded is balanced against the untoward side effects of the drug. An ECG should be done at baseline and periodically thereafter, especially during the period of dose adjustment (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS - Laboratory Tests). Periodic attempts should be made to reduce the dosage of pimozide tablets, USP to see whether or not tics persist at the level and extent first identified. In attempts to reduce the dosage of pimozide tablets, USP consideration should be given to the possibility that increases of tic intensity and frequency may represent a transient, withdrawal related phenomenon rather than a return of disease symptoms. Specifically, one to two weeks should be allowed to elapse before one concludes that an increase in tic manifestations is a function of the underlying disease syndrome rather than a response to drug withdrawal. A gradual withdrawal is recommended in any case. Children Reliable dose response data for the effects of pimozide tablets, USP on tic manifestation in Tourette’s Disorder patients below the age of twelve are not available. Treatment should be initiated at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg preferably taken once at bedtime. The dose may be increased every third day to a maximum of 0.2 mg/kg not to exceed 10 mg/day. At doses above 0.05 mg/kg/day, CYP 2D6 genotyping should be performed. In poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers, pimozide tablets, USP doses should not exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day, and doses should not be increased earlier than 14 days (see PRECAUTIONS – Pharmacogenomics). Adults In general, treatment with pimozide tablets, USP should be initiated with a dose of 1 to 2 mg a day in divided doses. The dose may be increased thereafter every other day. Most patients are maintained at less than 0.2 mg/kg/day, or 10 mg/day,",General,DailyMed,1,,,
