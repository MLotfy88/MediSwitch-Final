Antihypertensive agents such as diuretics may potentiate the orthostatic effect that is occasionally observed upon the initiation of SSRI or SNRI therapy. Syncope and orthostatic hypotension tend to occur within the first week of SNRI/SSRI therapy but can occur at any time during treatment, particularly after a dosage increase. The use of SSRIs or SNRIs may also cause sustained increases in blood pressure and heart rate, which may antagonize the therapeutic effects of antihypertensive medications.",
      "management_text": "Caution is recommended if SSRIs or SNRIs are prescribed in combination with diuretics, particularly in the elderly. Patients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience potential signs and symptoms of hyponatremia such as nausea, vomiting, headache, malaise, lethargy, irritability, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, muscle spasm, and unsteadiness (which may lead to falls). More severe and/or acute cases may include hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. Discontinuation of SSRI/SNRI therapy should be considered in patients who develop symptomatic hyponatremia, and appropriate medical intervention instituted as necessary. Patients should also have their blood pressure and pulse monitored before and during SSRI/SNRI therapy, especially during the first few weeks and following a dosage increase. Patients should be advised to avoid rising abruptly from a sitting or recumbent position and to notify their doctor if they experience dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope, orthostasis, or tachycardia.",

      "effect": "Coadministration with echinacea may alter the plasma concentrations and therapeutic effects of drugs that are substrates of CYP450 3A4. Echinacea appears to inhibit intestinal CYP450 3A4, which would lead to an increase in oral midazolam (a sensitive 3A4 substrate) bioavailability; however, plasma levels of midazolam following oral administration do not appear to be affected by echinacea. In contrast, it appears that echinacea may also induce hepatic CYP450 3A4; thereby increasing the hepatic clearance of drugs that are substrates of CYP450 3A4.",
      "management_text": "In general, patients should be advised to consult their healthcare provider before using any herbal or alternative medicines. If echinacea is prescribed with a drug that is a CYP450 3A4 substrate, the possibility of an altered (increased or decreased) therapeutic response should be considered. Patients should be monitored more closely following the addition or withdrawal of echinacea and the dosage of the CYP450 3A4 substrate adjusted as necessary.",
