    "indications": "Cradle cap, or pityriasis capitis, is a subset of infantile seborrheic dermatitis (ISD). It is a very common, mostly self-limiting, chronic non-inflammatory scaling skin condition that presents between the third week and first couple months of life. The peak incidence is at 3 months of life.\n[1]\nThe skin manifestations are marked by erythematous plaques with greasy-appearing yellowish scale. Cradle cap's name is analogous to its anatomical location. It can be found in areas dense in sebaceous gland activity, such as the scalp, T line of the face and external ears. Parents should be educated properly on the management and benign nature of this condition.",
    "mechanism": "Currently, there is no known cause for cradle crap. However, there are many factors that have been hypothesized to influence the condition. One hypothesis is the secondary influence of maternal circulating hormones resulting in overactive sebaceous gland activity.\n[2]\nSebaceous glands produce sebum, which is an oil-like substance. Overproduction of sebum causes the dead corneocytes (scale) to remain adherant instead of undergoing normal desquamation. Furthermore, the increase in frequency of seborrheic dermatitis during infancy and adolescence supports a hormonal influence on the condition. Malassezia, a yeast, has been implicated in many cases of cradle cap. The yeast breaks down sebum, consuming the saturated fatty acids, and subsequently leaves the unsaturated fatty acids behind. M. globosa and M. restricta have been found in over 80% of all age cases in an outpatient dermatology setting.\n[3]\nThe response from anti-fungals further strengthens this causal relationship. However, the yeast is also seen in a large quantity of normal patients, suggesting an independent susceptibility to the yeast.",
    "monitoring": "Cradle cap does not require biopsy or laboratory studies.",
    "administration": "Cradle cap is generally a self-limiting skin condition. Prevention of cradle cap is difficult, secondary to the unknown cause of the condition, yet many believe hormones play a strong role.\n[3]\nMoreover, the treatment for mild and localized cradle cap should remain conservative. The infant should be washed daily with a gentle baby shampoo along with an emollient (white petrolatum, mineral oil, baby oil) prior to the shampoo use. The emollient may prove more effective if remaining in contact with the skin for a prolonged period of time, overnight if necessary, to break up the scale. Afterward, there should be the gentle removal of scale with a soft toothbrush or cradle crap comb. The oil will help soften the scale making it easier for removal. Once the scale is removed, parents should continue daily shampooing of their infant's affected areas to prevent recurrence. Cradle cap that does not improve after conservative measures or that is extensive in nature can be treated with an antifungal cream such as ketoconazole 2% or a topical steroid cream such as hydrocortisone 1% for approximately 1-2 weeks. In intertriginous areas, ketoconazole 2% cream is the preferred treatment option. Wannanukul et al. reported no superiority between ketoconazole 2% and hydrocortisone 1% for ISD, suggesting the primary mechanism to be emollient care.  Nonetheless, the efficacy between 2% ketoconazole cream and 1% hydrocortisone cream showed no statistical significance in the better treatment option.  Selenium sulfide, zinc pyrithione, and salicylic acid are used in adults with seborrheic dermatitis, yet the efficacy and safety are not known in the infant population. Parents should also be educated on the chronicity of this condition during the early infant years and reminded of its self-limiting nature.\n[7]\n[8]",
    "adverse_effects": "Bacterial co-infection could be a possible, but rarely seen complication, likely due to repeated scratching if irritated."
