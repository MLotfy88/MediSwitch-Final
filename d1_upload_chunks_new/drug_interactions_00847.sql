Although these PPIs are primarily metabolized by CYP450 2C19, CYP450 3A4 is the major metabolic pathway in individuals who are CYP450 2C19-deficient (i.e., CYP450 2C19 poor metabolizers), thereby increasing the risk of CYP450 3A4-mediated interactions. Chronic use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may induce hypomagnesemia, and the risk may be increased during concomitant use of other agents that can cause magnesium loss such as tacrolimus. The mechanism via which hypomagnesemia may occur during long-term PPI use is unknown, although changes in intestinal absorption of magnesium may be involved.', 'DDInter', 'Since 2C19 genotype information is not frequently available for patients, caution is advised whenever tacrolimus is coadministered with PPIs. Pharmacologic response to tacrolimus and blood concentrations should be monitored more closely whenever the PPI is added to or withdrawn from therapy, and the tacrolimus dosage adjusted as necessary to prevent concentration-dependent adverse effects such as nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, posttransplant diabetes mellitus, infections, and myocardial hypertrophy. Clinicians should bear in mind that CYP450 2C19 deficiency can also be pharmacologically induced by drugs such as cimetidine, delavirdine, efavirenz, felbamate, fluconazole, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, oxcarbazepine, ticlopidine, and voriconazole. To minimize the risk of interaction, alternatives such as famotidine, nizatidine, ranitidine, or rabeprazole should be considered for acid suppression therapy in patients treated with tacrolimus. ​Monitoring of serum magnesium levels is recommended prior to initiation of therapy and periodically thereafter if prolonged treatment with a PPI is anticipated or when combined with other agents that can cause hypomagnesemia such as tacrolimus. Patients should be advised to seek immediate medical attention if they develop potential signs and symptoms of hypomagnesemia such as palpitations, arrhythmia, muscle spasm, tremor, or convulsions.
