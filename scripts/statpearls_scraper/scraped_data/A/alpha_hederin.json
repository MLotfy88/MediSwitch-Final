    "clinical_significance": "α-thalassemia has a broad spectrum of clinical presentations. Accurate diagnosis is thus crucial to management decision-making, as in determining whether a fetus with Hb Bart's should be aborted or given intrauterine transfusions.\n[45]\n\nParents with the silent carrier or α-thalassemia minor type may be properly counseled if diagnosed. Techniques like molecular analysis may be used in clinically difficult cases, as in families with mild mutations or α and β interactions. The laboratory evaluation of α-thalassemia thus holds paramount importance in improving patients' quality of life by timely initiation of therapy, counseling sessions, blood transfusions if required, and prevention of future complications."
