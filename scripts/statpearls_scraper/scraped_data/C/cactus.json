    "indications": "Plant chemistry and toxicology are complex with a rich history. Much about plant chemistry remains unknown, and our understanding relies on animal research combined with documented human experiences. The dynamic science of pharmacognosy, which highlights the therapeutic value of plants, has elucidated several major classes of organic molecules found in plants, of which alkaloids represent one. Others include phenols and phenylpropanoids; terpenes and resins; glycosides; and proteins, peptides, and lectins. Plant alkaloids represent a diverse array of secondary plant metabolites exemplified by familiar compounds such as nicotine, caffeine, cocaine, mescaline, ephedrine, and strychnine. Chemically classified as amines, plant alkaloids are defined by their function as bases generally containing one or more nitrogen atoms within a heterocyclic structure.\n[1]\n\nThey typically exhibit strong pharmacologic activity and serve as a constituent of these plants’ chemical arsenals. A given plant species may contain one, a few, or many types of alkaloids. Certain plant families are particularly rich in these phytochemicals, such as the Papaveraceae (poppy) and Solanaceae (nightshades).\n[2]\nMost in their pure forms are nonvolatile, colorless crystalline solids with a bitter taste.\n\nPlant alkaloids illustrate the overlap between the toxic and the therapeutic: one may appreciate the cytoprotective effects of the vinca alkaloids and the genotoxic effects of the pyrrolizidine alkaloids; the disruption of cholinergic neurotransmission by hyoscyamine and the therapeutic potential of pro-cholinergic galantamine in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease; the lethal potential of the “deadly nightshades” contrasted with the light shed on novel life-promoting therapeutic agents.\n[3]\n\nWithin this same group which we find coniine, the piperidine alkaloid and so-called “killer of Socrates” that claimed the philosopher’s life by respiratory arrest, we have the indole alkaloids with therapeutic potential in obstructive lung disease.\n[4]\n\nIn certain cases, one alkaloid may serve as the antidote for the toxicity of another. Since the discovery of morphine by modern chemistry, through repurposing and metabolic engineering, plant alkaloids have been exploited for their immense medicinal properties in a wealth of pharmacologic applications. These include the treatment of pain (e.g., morphine, cocaine), fever (e.g., quinine), malignancy (e.g., vinblastine, berberine), asthma (e.g., ephedrine), dysrhythmias (e.g., quinidine), hyperglycemia (e.g., piperine), hypertension (e.g., reserpine), and bacterial infections (e.g., ciprofloxacin). This activity will incorporate the available data to highlight the less desirable effects of these metabolites, the exposure to which may lead to disease.",
    "mechanism": "Plant alkaloid toxicity results from over-exposure to plants harboring these phytochemicals, including seeds, flowers, or weeds, in the form of extracts, tinctures, herbal teas, or as contaminants of food products. Utilization may be inadvertent or deliberate- recreational or for self-harm. Contact may be direct or indirect through inhalation, ingestion, transdermal, or vertical transmission. Nicotine toxicity can result after ingestion of\nNicotiana tabacum\nleaves, insecticidal products, electronic cigarette refills, cigarettes, and transdermal, as in green tobacco sickness affecting farm workers who harvest tobacco. Pyrrolizidine alkaloid toxicity may occur secondary to ingestion of parent plants for medicinal purposes or via consumption of food grain contaminated with the seeds of such plants.\n[5]\n\nMaternal consumption of plant products comprising pyridine or quinolizidine alkaloids has been linked to developmental defects in humans and animals. Through alkaloid-mediated desensitization of fetal muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, fetal movement is arrested and leads to skeletal flexure defects like kyphosis, lordosis, scoliosis, and torticollis.\n[6]\nCases of unintentional anticholinergic poisoning have resulted from tropane alkaloid contaminants in foods such as hamburgers, honey, millet used to make porridge, homemade wine, and Paraguay tea derived from Ilex paraguariensis. In 1995, an epidemic beginning in New York City ensued from the use of heroin adulterated with scopolamine, causing severe anticholinergic toxicity and affecting at least 300 unassuming individuals.\n[7]\n\nIn many instances, as in the case of nicotinic toxicity, only small concentrations of a toxin may be required to cause illness. Poison hemlock has been unintentionally ingested by foragers searching for wild carrots due to the similar appearance of the two plants. Cytisine, another nicotine-like alkaloid found in\nCytisus laburnum\n, has been held responsible for the mass poisoning of children and adults who consumed as little as 0.5 milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) body weight.",
    "monitoring": "The evaluation of the patient with a suspected plant alkaloid toxic exposure centers on plant identification and consultation with a medical toxicologist or poison control center. Identifying the plant species based on characteristic features and consultation with a poison expert can be diagnostic. The now decommissioned Federal Drug Administration-managed PLANTOX database can be utilized for comparison.\n\nAs analytical science methods continue to advance, confirmatory DNA analysis of plant material may become more widespread. The diagnosis is generally clinical, and laboratory studies may be of limited diagnostic utility. In the case of cocaine toxicity, urine assays detect its primary metabolite, benzoylecgonine, within four hours of cocaine use and up to 10 days after use.\n[17]\n\nLaboratory evaluation should investigate possible co-ingestions, and an electrocardiogram should be performed to evaluate for dysrhythmias or conduction abnormalities. The remainder of the workup should be dictated by the history and physical examination. For patients with altered mental status, it is prudent to broaden the differential and workup to other medical causes, including but not limited to infectious or structural, as appropriate. Anticholinergic toxicity is identified based on presentation, although clinical specimens can be tested for atropine and scopolamine.",
    "administration": "Management of these toxicities should focus on prevention, early identification, decontamination, close hemodynamic monitoring and observation, and supportive care. Early administration of activated charcoal within the first few hours of exposure to limit may benefit via the adsorption of toxins and reduced gastrointestinal absorption, but it is contraindicated in cases of an unprotected airway or decreased intestinal motility, as it may cause aspiration or bowel obstruction.\n[18]\n\nBenzodiazepines are first-line agents for acute agitation and seizures. For severe anticholinergic poisoning, the administration of a reversible anticholinesterase inhibitor should be considered. Classically, physostigmine was used, but it is not currently available. Rivastigmine and pyridostigmine have been proposed as alternatives but are not approved for this indication. Conversely, atropine is given as the antidote to reverse the cholinergic toxidrome.\n\nIn acute cocaine toxicity, beta-blockers should be avoided to prevent potential unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation. Sodium bicarbonate should be considered for wide-complex dysrhythmias. In opioid toxicity leading to respiratory depression, naloxone is indicated in addition to supportive care measures and close monitoring.",
    "adverse_effects": "Complications of plant alkaloid toxicity may be acute or chronic. Each of the toxidromes reviewed entails the potential to produce grave consequences if not identified or managed appropriately. The anticholinergic toxidrome that may result from belladonna alkaloid poisoning may be complicated by seizures or agitated delirium. Cardiac dysrhythmias that result may deteriorate into fatal dysrhythmias. Ingestion of one-hundred jimsonweed (\nDatura stramonium\n) seeds, which delivers about 6 mg of atropine, can prove fatal. Synephrine is a plant-derived alkaloid chemically related to ephedrine found in bitter orange (\nCitrus aurantium\n) that can also produce central nervous system stimulant activity. Like ephedrine, this toxin has been linked to deaths and drug interactions.\n[19]\n\nThe pyrrolizidine alkaloids are converted to highly reactive pyrroles by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, which result in hepatocellular toxicity in the acute setting. In about 30% of acute poisonings, a pyrrolizidine-alkaloid-induced proliferation of the hepatic vasculature intima leads to veno-occlusive disease. Death occurs in approximately 2 out of 10 cases. Toxicity with opioids and coniine may lead to respiratory depression, failure, and arrest. Berberine, derived from goldenseal (\nHydrastis canadensis\n) and barberry (Berberis spp), has produced both respiratory and myocardial depressant effects.\n[20]\n\nThe muscle spasms, rigidity, and weakness produced by strychnine may lead to respiratory failure and death. Consumption of sanguinarine may induce heart failure and myocarditis.\n[21]\nChronic exposure to arecoline via betel nut (Areca catechu) chewing has been shown to lead to genotoxicity, oral submucous fibrosis, and head and neck cancer. Chronic dependence may result from prolonged and excessive use of opioids, cocaine, and the psychotropic alkaloids lysergic acid diethylamide and mescaline. Personality changes, mood lability, psychosis, rage reactions, and even suicidal or homicidal ideations may occur with the overuse of the latter three phytochemicals."
