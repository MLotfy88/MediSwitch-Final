Orthostatic effects are most common during initiation of therapy and often occur within 90 minutes after the first dose.  However, they can also occur following a dosage increase or resumption of therapy after an interruption of more than a few days.  Agents with alpha 1a specificity, such as tamsulosin, act primarily on the prostate but are not devoid of hypotensive effects.  Therapy with peripheral alpha-1 blockers should be administered cautiously in patients with or predisposed to hypotensive or syncopal episodes.  Caution is also advised in patients who are dehydrated (e.g., due to severe or prolonged diarrhea or vomiting), since they may be more sensitive to the hypotensive effect of the drugs.  Therapy should be initiated with the lowest dosage possible and titrated gradually based on patient response and tolerance in accordance with the individual product package labeling.  During initiation or reinstitution of therapy and following an increase in dosage, patients should be advised not to rise abruptly from a sitting or recumbent position and to avoid situations where injury could result if syncope occur.  Concomitant use of alcohol, extensive periods of standing, prolonged or intense exercise, and exposure to heat can also precipitate orthostatic hypotension and should be minimized.  If dizziness, lightheadedness or palpitations occur, the patient should sit or lie down, and seek medical attention if symptoms are recurrent or bothersome.', '2', 'Grunstein JA "The problem of postural hypotension."

HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are extensively metabolized by the liver.  Decreased drug metabolism may lead to accumulation and increased risk of toxicity, including biochemical abnormalities of liver function and, rarely, jaundice, hepatitis, cirrhosis, fatty change in the liver, and fulminant hepatic necrosis.  Therapy with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors should be administered cautiously in patients with a history of liver disease and/or heavy alcohol use.  A lower initial dosage may be appropriate, and clinical monitoring of liver transaminase levels according to the individual product package labeling is recommended.  Patients who develop elevated  ALT or AST levels during therapy should be monitored until abnormalities resolve.
