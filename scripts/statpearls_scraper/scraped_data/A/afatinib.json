    "indications": "Warnings and Precautions\n\nNo contraindications are listed in the manufacturer's labeling thus far. However, prescribers should withhold dosing for any adverse drug reactions.\n[16]\n\nPermanent discontinuation of this drug is required if any of the following are recorded.\n\nLife-threatening bullous, blistering, or exfoliative skin lesions.\nInterstitial lung disease (ILD)\nSevere drug-induced hepatic impairment\nPersistent ulcerative keratitis\nSymptomatic left ventricle dysfunction\nSevere or intolerable adverse reactions occurring at a dose of 20 mg/d\n\nThis drug is not recommended during pregnancy, as no adequate clinical trials exist examining the drug's use during pregnancy. Instead, a strong recommendation is that women of reproductive age use an effective contraception method during therapy. It should be continued at least 2 weeks after the last dose of afatinib. The manufacturer warns against using this medication during breastfeeding, given the potentially severe adverse reactions in a breastfed infant. Breastfeeding can resume 2 weeks after the last dose.\n[17]",
    "mechanism": "Similarly to other protein kinase inhibitors, afatinib's mechanism of action involves irreversibly inhibiting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and HER4.\n[1]\nEGFR and HER2 are part of the receptor tyrosine kinase family and play significant roles in tumor cell proliferation and vascularization. These receptors are known to exhibit overexpression in many cancer cell types.\n\nAfatinib loses its activity against T790M EGFR mutations, and osimertinib has a high clinical response rate to this mutation.\n[9]\n\nAfatinib exerts antineoplastic effects in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) by suppressing mTORC1, which initiates apoptosis of the cancer cells.\n[10]\nCombining autophagy inhibitors with afatinib could improve the treatment of HNSCC.\n\nZhu X. et al conducted a study on afatinib-resistant lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (HCC827 AR). The baculovirus IAP repeat protein 5 (BIRC5) was overexpressed in this cell line and was detected on Western blot analysis. BIRC5 overexpression may confer resistance to afatinib by dysregulation of apoptosis. The BIRC5 inhibitor, YM155, restored afatinib activity against the lung adenocarcinoma cell line.\n[11]\n\nAfatinib helps manage rare epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. It effectively treats osimertinib resistance mutations, such as G724S and L718Q/V. Afatinib also effectively treats E709X, E709_T710delinsX, some rare exon 19, and some 20 exon insertional mutations. However, some rare exon 19 and some 20 exon insertional mutations do not respond to afatinib treatment.\n[12]",
    "administration": "Available Dosage Forms\n\nAfatinib is an orally administered drug that is only available in tablet form. These tablets can be in 20, 30, or 40 mg doses. An afatinib tablet should be taken on an empty stomach at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal, as absorption decreases with high-fat meals. The tablet should be swallowed whole with at least 8 ounces of water. The tablet should never be crushed or dissolved. This medication should be stored at room temperature (68 °F to 77 °F or 20 °C to 25 °C).\n\nAdult Dosing\n\nThe recommended dosage is 40 mg tablets daily in a patient with normal creatinine clearance without any significant liver dysfunction until the disease progresses or the patient no longer tolerates it. Following oral administration, the time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax) is reported to be between 2 and 5 hours.\n[13]\n\nFor both non-small cell and squamous non-small cell metastatic cancers, dosing is 40 mg orally once daily, preferably more than an hour before or 2 hours after food intake.\n\nSpecific Patient Populations\n\nHepatic impairment:\nNo dosage adjustment is necessary for mild-moderate (Child-Pugh A or B) hepatic impairment. For severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, the patient should be closely monitored, and the dose should be adjusted if not tolerated.\n\nRenal impairment:\nThe dosage changes for patients with kidney disease are based on creatinine clearance (CrCl):\n\n30 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m\n2\n: no dosage adjustment necessary\n15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m\n2\n: 30 mg PO daily\n<15 mL/min/1.73 m\n2\n: Not studied",
    "adverse_effects": "Based on a study by Keating et al, afatinib has a predictable and manageable side effect profile.\n[1]\nHowever, like other medications, it has a particular adverse event profile. The most commonly reported adverse events are diarrhea and rash/acne in 88% and 82% of patients, respectively.\n[14]\n\nDermatologic:\nAcneiform eruption (≤90%)\nSkin rash (≤90%)\nParonychia (11% to 58%)\nXeroderma (31%)\nPruritus (10% to 21%)\nCheilitis (12%)\nEndocrine & metabolic:\nDecreased serum potassium (11% to 30%)\nWeight loss (17%)\nHypokalemia (11%)\nGastrointestinal:\nDiarrhea (75% to 96%)\nStomatitis (30% to 71%)\nDecreased appetite (25% to 29%)\nNausea (21% to 25%)\nVomiting (13% to 23%)\nGenitourinary:\nCystitis (13%)\nHematologic & oncologic:\nAbnormal lymphocytes (decreased: 38%; grades 3/4: 9%)\nDecreased white blood cell count (12%; grades 3/4: 1%)\nHepatic:\nIncreased serum ALT (10% to 54%)\nIncreased serum alkaline phosphatase (34% to 51%)\nIncreased serum AST (7% to 46%)\nAbnormal hepatic function tests (6% to 18%)\nIncreased serum bilirubin (3% to 16%)\nOphthalmic:\nConjunctivitis (11%)\nRenal:\nDecreased creatinine clearance (49%)\nRespiratory:\nEpistaxis (17%)\nRhinorrhea (11%)\nMiscellaneous:\nFever (12%)\n\nThe following side effects occurred in up to 10% of patients.\n\nCentral nervous system:\nFatigue (under 2%)\nDermatologic:\nNail disease (3% to 9%)\nPalmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (2% to 7%)\nOphthalmic:\nKeratitis (≤2%)\nRenal:\nRenal insufficiency (6%)\nRespiratory:\nInterstitial pulmonary disease (2%)\n[6]\nDyspnea (≤2%)\n\nLiu X et al reported 2 cases of interstitial pneumonia during afatinib therapy.\n[15]\nThe first case is a 58-year-old man with advanced lung adenocarcinoma. The patient had EGFR mutations, including exon 18 G719X and exon 20 S781I. This patient presented with shortness of breath and fever 68 days after starting afatinib therapy and received treatment with an empirical antimicrobial and a low-dose glucocorticoid. The afatinib-induced interstitial pneumonia was not diagnosed. The patient died 15 days after the onset of symptoms because of pulmonary inflammation.\n\nThe second case is a 57-year-old man with advanced lung adenocarcinoma. The patient had EGFR mutations, including exon 21 L861Q. This patient presented with shortness of breath and fever 22 days after starting afatinib therapy. The patient received empirical antimicrobial treatment, and 5 days later, the patient received a CT scan, which showed pulmonary inflammation. The patient was diagnosed with afatinib-induced interstitial pneumonia and was promptly treated with glucocorticoid therapy, which quickly resolved the pneumonia. The investigators concluded that clinicians must be vigilant for the uncommon event of afatinib-induced interstitial pneumonia and treat it promptly with glucocorticoid therapy.",
    "monitoring": "Afatinib has several monitoring requirements.\n[18]\n[19]\nThese include:\n\nSince dermatology adverse reactions are the most commonly reported during treatment, patients should be advised to avoid sun exposure if possible or utilize adequate sun protection.\n[20]\nMonitor for signs and symptoms of volume depletion in patients with diarrhea.\nHepatic impairment was commonly observed in clinical trials; it is advised to monitor liver function periodically during treatment.\nRenal function requires periodic monitoring.\nKeratitis is one of the rare adverse effects reported in clinical trials; therapy should be interrupted with any suspected keratitis.\nIt is recommended to reduce the dose in patients with paronychia.\nMonitor patients for any signs and symptoms that raise concern for pulmonary toxicity; interstitial lung disease occurred in a small percentage of patients.\nAssess left ventricle function before and during treatment in patients with high-risk cardiac conditions. This drug should be used with caution in patients with cardiac risk factors or decreased left ventricle heart failure, as patients with significant cardiac history met exclusion criteria for clinical trials.\n\nTakahashi T et al studied using afatinib trough plasma concentrations in patients with non–small cell lung cancer to improve the safety and efficacy of afatinib therapy.\n[21]",
    "toxicity": "Limited research and data regarding toxic and therapeutic levels of afatinib are available. However, it has been reported to have a predictable and manageable profile in terms of side effects.\n\nSome severe adverse reactions have been identified, including hepatic impairment, dermatology complications, and rarely lung and cardiac complications. Afatinib should be dose-adjusted in case of concomitant treatment with P-glycoprotein inducers or inhibitors.\n[13]"
