Because vitamin E is an antioxidant, pharmacologic doses could theoretically interfere with radiation therapy and chemotherapeutic agents whose cytotoxic mechanism depends on generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that damage DNA and proteins, including but not limited to alkylating agents (e.g., busulfan, cyclophosphamide, melphalan), anthracyclines (e.g., doxorubicin, epirubicin), platinum coordination complexes (e.g., cisplatin, carboplatin), DNA topoisomerase inhibitors (e.g., etoposide, teniposide, irinotecan, topotecan), and photodynamic agents (e.g., porfimer). On the other hand, vitamin E may help reduce oxidative stress associated with more aggressive cancers and protect non-cancer cells from oxidative damage generated by cancer treatments, which can enhance patient tolerance and lessen the need for reducing dosage or duration of treatment.",

The risk of systemic anticholinergic effects following topical administration depends on variables such as strength of the product, size of the application area, frequency of application, and use of occlusive dressing.

By inhibiting the metabolism of acetylcholine, more of the neurotransmitter may be available to compete at muscarinic receptors, the site of action of anticholinergic agents. Conversely, anticholinergic agents may negate the already small pharmacologic benefits of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in the treatment of dementia.

Clinically significant mental status changes associated with anticholinergic agents can range from mild cognitive impairment to delirium, and patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementia are especially sensitive.",

For patients requiring treatment to counteract adverse effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor therapy (e.g., gastrointestinal intolerance, urinary problems), an agent without anticholinergic properties should be used whenever possible. Otherwise, a dosage reduction, slower titration, or even discontinuation of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor should be considered. For patients who are already receiving an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor with anticholinergic agents, every attempt should be made to discontinue the latter or substitute them with less anticholinergic alternatives.

By inhibiting the metabolism of acetylcholine, more of the neurotransmitter may be available to compete at muscarinic receptors, the site of action of anticholinergic agents. Conversely, anticholinergic agents may negate the already small pharmacologic benefits of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in the treatment of dementia. These agents may also adversely affect elderly patients in general. Clinically significant mental status changes associated with anticholinergic agents can range from mild cognitive impairment to delirium, and patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementia are especially sensitive.",

For patients requiring treatment to counteract adverse effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor therapy (e.g., gastrointestinal intolerance, urinary problems), an agent without anticholinergic properties should be used whenever possible. Otherwise, a dosage reduction, slower titration, or even discontinuation of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor should be considered. For patients who are already receiving an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor with anticholinergic agents, every attempt should be made to discontinue the latter or substitute them with less anticholinergic alternatives. Caution is required, however, since anticholinergic withdrawal may occur.

By inhibiting the metabolism of acetylcholine, more of the neurotransmitter may be available to compete at muscarinic receptors, the site of action of anticholinergic agents. Conversely, anticholinergic agents may negate the already small pharmacologic benefits of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in the treatment of dementia. These agents may also adversely affect elderly patients in general. Clinically significant mental status changes associated with anticholinergic agents can range from mild cognitive impairment to delirium, and patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementia are especially sensitive.",

For patients requiring treatment to counteract adverse effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor therapy (e.g., gastrointestinal intolerance, urinary problems), an agent without anticholinergic properties should be used whenever possible. Otherwise, a dosage reduction, slower titration, or even discontinuation of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor should be considered. For patients who are already receiving an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor with anticholinergic agents, every attempt should be made to discontinue the latter or substitute them with less anticholinergic alternatives. Caution is required, however, since anticholinergic withdrawal may occur. Seizures have been reported following abrupt discontinuation of anticholinergics during acetylcholinesterase inhibitor therapy.",

The risk of systemic anticholinergic effects following topical administration depends on variables such as strength of the product, size of the application area, frequency of application, and use of occlusive dressing. Systemic effects are uncommon following oral inhalation or nasal administration due to the poor absorption of quaternary ammonium compounds from gastrointestinal and nasal mucosa.",
