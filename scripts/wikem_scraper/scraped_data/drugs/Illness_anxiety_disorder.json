If another medical condition is present or there is a high risk for developing a medical condition (e.g., strong family history is present), the preoccupation is clearly excessive or disproportionate.\nC. There is a high level of anxiety about health, and the individual is easily alarmed about personal health status.\nD. The individual performs excessive health-related behaviors (e.g., repeatedly checks his or her body for signs of illness) or exhibits maladaptive avoidance (e.g., avoids doctor appointments and hospitals).\nE. Illness preoccupation has been present for at least 6 months, but the specific illness that is feared may change over that period of time.\nF. The illness-related preoccupation is not better explained by another mental disorder, such as somatic symptom disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, body dysmor­phic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or delusional disorder, somatic type.",
