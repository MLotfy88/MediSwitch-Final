The proposed mechanism is NSAID-induced inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis, which results in unopposed pressor activity producing hypertension. In addition, NSAIDs can cause fluid retention, which also affects blood pressure. Indomethacin and piroxicam have been reported to have greater attenuating effects than other NSAIDs, and indomethacin effects may be significant in patients with eclampsia.', 'DDInter', 1767317476, 'Patients receiving a beta-blocker who require prolonged (greater than 1 week) concomitant therapy with an NSAID should have blood pressure monitored more closely following initiation, discontinuation, or change of dosage of the NSAID. The interaction is not expected to occur with low doses (e.g., low-dose aspirin) or intermittent short-term administration of NSAIDs.', 'Antagonism', 'Patients receiving a beta-blocker who require prolonged (greater than 1 week) concomitant therapy with an NSAID should have blood pressure monitored more closely following initiation, discontinuation, or change of dosage of the NSAID.', NULL, NULL, 'Moderate', 'pharmacodynamic');

In the presence of beta-blockade, the risk and/or severity of first-dose effects associated with alpha-blockers such as postural hypotension and syncope may be increased. Beta-blockers may also blunt the reflex tachycardia that occurs in response to postural hypotension. Theoretically, the interaction may also occur with beta-blocker ophthalmic preparations, since they may be systemically absorbed and can produce clinically significant systemic effects even at low or undetectable plasma levels.', 'DDInter', 1767317476, 'Caution is advised during coadministration of these agents, particularly when initiating an alpha-blocker in the presence of a beta-blocker, including ophthalmic formulations. Small initial dosages of the alpha-blocker should be considered and gradually titrated to desired effect, while the systemic beta-blocker dosage may also need to be reduced. Hemodynamic responses should be monitored, especially during the first few weeks of therapy. Taking the alpha-blocker at bedtime may minimize the occurrence of orthostatic effects. Patients should be advised to avoid rising abruptly from a sitting or recumbent position and to notify their physician if they experience dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope, orthostasis, or tachycardia.', 'Synergism', 'Caution is advised during coadministration of these agents, particularly when initiating an alpha-blocker in the presence of a beta-blocker, including ophthalmic formulations.', NULL, NULL, 'Moderate', 'pharmacodynamic');
