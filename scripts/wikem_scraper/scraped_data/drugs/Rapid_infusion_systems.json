      "text": "Infusion Pumps: Commonly used in acute care. Maximum flow rate of 1000 mL/h.\nGravity: Fluid flow is determined by multiple factors, including luminal flow, length of the tube and where it is positioned.\nPressure Bag: Applying a form of pressure to the bag can increase flow rate, but often not substantially.\n\"Push- pull technique\": Manual syringe infusion typically used in pediatric patients using a syringe and three-way stopcock.\nTraditional Rapid Infuser:\nLifeFlow PLUS: A hand-operated rapid infuser.",
