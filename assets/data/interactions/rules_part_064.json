The manufacturer recommends lamotrigine be avoided in patients who have cardiac conduction disorders (e.g., second- or third-degree heart block), ventricular arrhythmias, or cardiac disease or abnormality (e.g., myocardial ischemia, heart failure, structural heart disease, Brugada syndrome or other sodium channelopathies) as use may increase the risk of proarrhythmias including sudden death. Patients should be advised to seek prompt medical attention if they experience symptoms that could indicate an irregular heart rhythm such as dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, palpitation, shortness of breath, or syncope.",
