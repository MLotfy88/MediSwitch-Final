Opioids such as fentanyl and its analogues, when combined with isoflurane, may lead to a synergistic fall in blood pressure and respiratory rate. Nitrous oxide decreases the MAC of isoflurane (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Isoflurane potentiates the muscle relaxant effect of all muscle relaxants and decreases the required doses of neuromuscular blocking agents. In general, anesthetic concentrations of isoflurane at equilibrium reduce the ED 95 of succinylcholine, atracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium by approximately 25 to 40% or more compared to N 2O/opioid anesthesia. If added relaxation is required, supplemental doses of muscle relaxants may be used. Isoflurane is similar to sevofl', 'DailyMed'),
