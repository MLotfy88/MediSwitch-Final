These agents individually have been associated with the development of pseudotumor cerebri and may have additive effects during coadministration. Both acute and chronic vitamin A intoxication have been identified as secondary causes of pseudotumor cerebri.', NULL, 'Caution is advised if vitamin A is coadministered with tetracyclines.', NULL, 'Caution is advised if vitamin A is coadministered with tetracyclines. Concomitant use of most retinoids with tetracyclines is considered contraindicated. Patients treated with any of these agents should be advised to discontinue treatment and notify their physician immediately if they develop early symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri such as headache, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, vision loss, and papilledema. Although intracranial hypertension typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. Therefore, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation should be performed if visual disturbances occur. Since intracranial pressure may remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, patients should be monitored until they stabilize.', 'Synergism', NULL, NULL, 'Major', NULL, 'DDInter', 'pharmacodynamic', 1767317476);
