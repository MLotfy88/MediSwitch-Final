    "clinical_significance": "Obesity is a prevalent comorbidity in medicine, posing a significant risk during hospital admissions, particularly for VTE. Therefore, an assessment is necessary, which typically involves administering anticoagulation injections and using anti-thromboembolic stockings. Another frequent issue is post-surgical wound infections, for which negative pressure wound dressings and stringent infection control during surgery are recommended.\n[71]",
    "monitoring": "Naturopathy in Obesity Management\n\nNaturopathy, a form of complementary and alternative medicine, provides holistic approaches to managing obesity, often incorporating dietary supplements. Notably, it is crucial to approach all treatments, including naturopathic interventions, with caution and consideration.\n\nHerbal supplements:\nHerbal supplements offer a natural approach to weight management, utilizing various plant-derived compounds with purported benefits, as mentioned below.\n\nGreen tea extract: Green tea extract is derived from green tea leaves that are rich in catechins. Catechins are compounds known for their antioxidant properties, which may aid in weight management by boosting metabolism and promoting fat oxidation.\n\nGarcinia cambogia: Garcinia cambogia is extracted from a tropical fruit, which is reputed to suppress appetite and potentially inhibit fat production, although research findings are inconclusive.\n\nForskolin: Forskolin is an herb from the mint family and is believed to increase the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate, which may aid in fat breakdown and promote weight loss.\n\nFiber supplements:\nFiber supplements that help in weight management are listed below.\n\nPsyllium husk: Psyllium is a soluble fiber that can promote feelings of fullness, regulate bowel movements, and support healthy digestion, which may aid in weight management.\n\nGlucomannan: Glucomannan is a soluble fiber derived from the konjac root. This absorbs water in the digestive tract, creating a feeling of fullness and reducing calorie intake.\n\nProbiotics:\nProbiotics are increasingly studied for their potential role in weight management.\n\nCertain strains of probiotics may help regulate gut microbiota composition, which could influence metabolic processes and inflammation related to obesity.\n\nLactobacillus gasseri\nand\nL rhamnosus\nare among the strains studied for their potential benefits in weight management.\n\nMineral and vitamin supplements:\nCertain supplements, such as vitamin D and magnesium, aid in weight loss.\n\nVitamin D: Low vitamin D levels have been associated with obesity, and supplementation may help improve insulin sensitivity and support weight loss.\n\nMagnesium: Magnesium deficiency has been linked to metabolic dysfunction, and supplementation may help improve insulin sensitivity and support weight management.\n\nOmega-3 fatty acids:\nFish oil supplements, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, may have anti-inflammatory effects, aid in weight loss, and reduce obesity-related complications."
