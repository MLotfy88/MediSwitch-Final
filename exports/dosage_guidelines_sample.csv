The usual maintenance dosage range is 2.5 to 20 mg per day administered as a single dose or in two equally divided doses. If blood pressure is not controlled with ramipril alone, a diuretic can be added.After the initial dose of ramipril, the patient should be observed under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour. The appearance of hypotension after the initial dose of ramipril does not preclude subsequent careful dose titration with the drug, following effective management of the hypotension.The ramipril capsule is usually swallowed whole.

Your healthcare provider should show you or your caregiver how to mix (reconstitute) and give ALTUVIIIO the first time ALTUVIIIO is used. Important Information You Need to Know Before Injecting ALTUVIIIO It is important that you do not try to inject ALTUVIIIO unless you have received training from a healthcare provider. Before you inject ALTUVIIIO, you must mix (reconstitute) ALTUVIIIO powder with liquid (diluent) that comes in a prefilled diluent syringe. After the powder and diluent are mixed the medicine is given in the vein (intravenous injection). Do not give mixed ALTUVIIIO in the same tubing or container with other medicines. Remove the product kit from the refrigerator and allow the ALTUVIIIO vial and the prefilled diluent syringe to come to room temperature prior to injection. Storing of Mixed (Reconstituted) ALTUVIIIO ALTUVIIIO should be given within 3 hours after mixing. Preparing to Inject ALTUVIIIO Mixing (Reconstitution) Step 1: Look at the ALTUVIIIO kit: Check that you have the correct medicine and dose. Step 12: Slowly push down on the plunger rod to inject all of the liquid (diluent) from the prefilled diluent syringe into the vial. Once you have pooled the required dose, proceed with Step 16 (Injecting ALTUVIIIO) using the larger luer lock syringe. If you are not ready to inject, put the syringe cap carefully back onto the syringe tip. Note : Mixed (reconstituted) ALTUVIIIO should be given within 3 hours after mixing. Injecting ALTUVIIIO ALTUVIIIO is given in the vein (intravenous injection) after mixing (reconstitution) of the powdered medicine with the diluent. These are very generic instructions so your healthcare provider should teach you how to inject ALTUVIIIO. After you have been taught to self-inject, you can follow these instructions. Do not give mixed (reconstituted) ALTUVIIIO if it contains particles, is discolored, or is cloudy. Do not give mixed (reconstituted) ALTUVIIIO in the same tubing or container with other medicines. Step 17: Apply a tourniquet to the upper arm. Step 20: Use tape to secure the plastic wings of the needle in place at the injection site if needed. Note : Always make sure you have correctly inserted the needle into a vein when you perform an intravenous injection. Step 21: Slowly push the plunger rod on the syringe all the way down to give ALTUVIIIO. Your healthcare provider will provide your rate of administration based on your comfort level and the minimum injection time recommendation per vial. Note : A small amount of medicine will be left in the infusion set after injection. Use a cotton ball or gauze pad to put pressure on the injection site for several minutes to stop any bleeding. Note : You may apply an adhesive bandage if needed.",,,,,,Intravenous

Dosage in Adults [18 years of age and older] ( 2.2 ): Administer a single 70-mg loading dose on Day 1, followed by 50 mg once daily for all indications except esophageal candidiasis. For esophageal candidiasis, use 50 mg once daily with no loading dose. For all indications, administer a single 70-mg/m 2 loading dose on Day 1, followed by 50 mg/m 2 once daily thereafter. Maximum loading dose and daily maintenance dose should not exceed 70 mg, regardless of the patient's calculated dose. Dosage Adjustments in Patients with Hepatic Impairment ( 2.4 ): Reduce dosage for adult patients with moderate hepatic impairment (35 mg once daily, with a 70 mg loading dose on Day 1 where appropriate). Dosage Adjustment in Patients Receiving Concomitant Inducers of Hepatic CYP Enzymes ( 2.5 ): Use 70-mg once daily dose for adult patients on rifampin. Consider dose increase to 70 mg once daily for adult patients on nevirapine, efavirenz, carbamazepine, dexamethasone, or phenytoin. Pediatric patients receiving these same concomitant medications may also require an increase in dose to 70 mg/m 2 once daily (maximum daily dose not to exceed 70 mg). 2.1 Important Administration Instructions for Use in All Patients Administer caspofungin acetate for injection by slow intravenous (IV) infusion over approximately 1 hour. Do not administer caspofungin acetate for injection by IV bolus administration. 2.2 Recommended Dosage in Adult Patients [18 years of age and older] The dosage and duration of caspofungin acetate for injection treatment for each indication are as follows: Empirical Therapy for Presumed Fungal Infections in Febrile Neutropenic Patients Administer a single 70-mg loading dose on Day 1, followed by 50 mg once daily thereafter. If the 50-mg dose is well tolerated but does not provide an adequate clinical response, the daily dose can be increased to 70 mg. Candidemia and Other Candida Infections Administer a single 70-mg loading dose on Day 1, followed by 50 mg once daily thereafter. Esophageal Candidiasis The dose is 50 mg once daily for 7 to 14 days after symptom resolution. Invasive Aspergillosis Administer a single 70-mg loading dose on Day 1, followed by 50 mg once daily thereafter. 2.3 Recommended Dosing in Pediatric Patients [3 months to 17 years of age] For all indications, administer a single 70 mg/m 2 loading dose on Day 1, followed by 50 mg/m 2 once daily thereafter. The maximum loading dose and the daily maintenance dose should not exceed 70 mg, regardless of the patient's calculated dose. Dosing in pediatric patients (3 months to 17 years of age) should be based on the patient's body surface area (BSA) as calculated by the Mosteller Formula [see References (15) ]: Following calculation of the patient's BSA, the loading dose in milligrams should be calculated as BSA (m 2 ) × 70 mg/m 2. The maintenance dose in milligrams should be calculated as BSA (m 2 ) × 50 mg/m 2. If the 50-mg/m 2 daily dose is well tolerated but does not provide an adequate clinical response, the daily dose can be increased to 70 mg/m 2 daily (not to exceed 70 mg). For adult patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), caspofungin 35 mg once daily is recommended based upon pharmacokinetic data [see.",,,,,,Oral

It is recommended that Theophylline (Anhydrous) Extended-Release Tablets be taken with meals. Infrequently, patients receiving Theophylline (Anhydrous) Extended-Release 200 or 300 mg Tablets may pass an intact matrix tablet in the stool or via colostomy. Stabilized patients, 12 years of age or older, who are taking an immediate-release or controlled-release theophylline product may be transferred to once-daily administration of 200 mg or 300 mg Theophylline (Anhydrous) Extended-Release Tablets on a mg-for-mg basis. Because of marked individual differences in the rate of theophylline clearance, the dose required to achieve a peak serum theophylline concentration in the 10-20 mcg/mL range varies fourfold among otherwise similar patients in the absence of factors known to alter theophylline clearance (e.g., 400-1600 mg/day in adults <60 years old and 10-36 mg/kg/day in children 1-9 years old). For a given population there is no single theophylline dose that will provide both safe and effective serum concentrations for all patients. Administration of the median theophylline dose required to achieve a therapeutic serum theophylline concentration in a given population may result in either sub-therapeutic or potentially toxic serum theophylline concentrations in individual patients. For example, at a dose of 900 mg/d in adults <60 years or 22 mg/kg/d in children 1-9 years, the steady-state peak serum theophylline concentration will be <10 mcg/mL in about 30% of patients, 10-20 mcg/mL in about 50% and 20-30 mcg/mL in about 20% of patients.

Use zinc sulfate injection for admixing promptly once the sterile transfer set has been inserted into the pharmacy bulk package container or not more than 4 hours at room temperature 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F) (25ºC/77ºF) after the container closure has been penetrated. Use parenteral nutrition solutions containing zinc sulfate injection promptly after mixing. 2.4 Dosing Considerations The dosage of the final parenteral nutrition solution containing zinc sulfate injection must be based on the concentrations of all components in the solution and the recommended daily nutritional requirements [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. Prior to administration of parenteral nutrition solution containing zinc sulfate injection, correct severe fluid, electrolyte and acid-base disorders. 2.5 Recommended Dosage and Monitoring in Adult and Pediatric Patients Zinc sulfate injection provides 1 mg/mL or 5 mg/mL of zinc. Zinc sulfate injection in a concentration of 1 mg/mL is recommended for use in pediatric patients, particularly those weighing less than 12 kg. The dosage of zinc sulfate injection should be individualized based on the patient’s clinical condition, nutritional requirements, and the contribution of oral or enteral zinc intake. Adults The recommended adult dosage is 3 mg/day for metabolically stable patients, with potential need for a higher daily dosage in monitored patients with small bowel fluid loss or excess stool or ileostomy output. Recommended Dosage of Zinc Sulfate Injection for Pediatric Patients by Age and Estimated Weight Population Estimated Weight for Age Recommended Daily Dosage Pediatric patients 10 kg and above 50 mcg/kg (up to 3 mg/day) 5 kg to less than 10 kg 100 mcg/kg Term neonates 3 kg to less than 5 kg 250 mcg/kg* Preterm neonates Less than 3 kg 400 mcg/kg *Term neonates have higher requirements in the first 3 months of life Monitoring Monitor zinc concentrations during treatment.

The recommended dosage for Famotidine Injection in adult patients is 20 mg intravenously q 12 h. The studies described in PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Patients <1 Year of Age suggest the following starting doses in pediatric patients <1 year of age: Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) - 0.5 mg/kg/dose of famotidine oral suspension for the treatment of GERD for up to 8 weeks once daily in patients <3 months of age and 0.5 mg/kg/dose twice daily in patients 3 months to <1 year of age. The studies described in PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Patients 1 to 16 Years of Age suggest that the starting dose in pediatric patients 1 to 16 years of age is 0.25 mg/kg intravenously (injected over a period of not less than two minutes or as a 15-minute infusion) q 12 h up to 40 mg/day. Published uncontrolled studies in pediatric patients 1 to 16 years of age have demonstrated gastric acid suppression with doses up to 0.5 mg/kg intravenously q 12 h. Dosage Adjustments for Patients with Moderate or Severe Renal Insufficiency In adult patients with moderate (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min) or severe (creatinine clearance <10 mL/min) renal insufficiency, the elimination half-life of famotidine is increased. Since CNS adverse effects have been reported in patients with moderate and severe renal insufficiency, to avoid excess accumulation of the drug in patients with moderate or severe renal insufficiency, the dose of Famotidine Injection may be reduced to half the dose, or the dosing interval may be prolonged to 36 to 48 hours as indicated by the patient's clinical response. The recommended adult intravenous dose is 20 mg q 12 h. In some patients, a higher starting dose may be required. Oral doses up to 160 mg q 6 h have been administered to some adult patients with severe Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome. To prepare intravenous solutions, aseptically dilute 2 mL of Famotidine Injection (solution containing 10 mg/mL) with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or other compatible intravenous solution (see Stability ) to a total volume of either 5 mL or 10 mL and inject over a period of not less than 2 minutes. To prepare intravenous infusion solutions, aseptically dilute 2 mL of Famotidine Injection with 100 mL of 5% Dextrose or other compatible solution (see Stability ), and infuse over a 15 to 30 minute period. Concomitant Use of Antacids Antacids may be given orally concomitantly if needed. When added to or diluted with most commonly used intravenous solutions, e.g., Water for Injection, 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, 5% and 10% Dextrose Injection, or Lactated Ringer's Injection, diluted Famotidine Injection is physically and chemically stable (i.e., maintains at least 90% of initial potency) for 7 days at room temperature – see HOW SUPPLIED , Storage. When added to or diluted with Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, 5%, Famotidine Injection at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL (the recommended concentration of famotidine intravenous infusion solutions) is physically and chemically stable (i.e., maintains at least 90% of initial potency) for 7 days at room temperature – see HOW SUPPLIED , Storage.

Adult A single application should not exceed 5 g of Lidocaine Ointment 5%, containing 250 mg of lidocaine base (equivalent chemically to approximately 300 mg of lidocaine hydrochloride). In a 70 kg adult this dose equals 3.6 mg/kg (1.6 mg/lb) lidocaine base. No more than one-half tube, approximately 17-20 g of ointment or 850-1000 mg lidocaine base, should be administered in any one day. Although the incidence of adverse effects with Lidocaine Ointment 5% is quite low, caution should be exercised, particularly when employing large amounts, since the incidence of adverse effects is directly proportional to the total dose of local anesthetic agent administered. Dosage for children It is difficult to recommend a maximum dose of any drug for children since this varies as a function of age and weight. For children less than ten years who have a normal lean body mass and a normal lean body development, the maximum dose may be determined by the application of one of the standard pediatric drug formulas (e.g., Clark's rule). For example a child of five years weighing 50 lbs., the dose of lidocaine should not exceed 75-100 mg when calculated according to Clark's rule. In any case, the maximum amount of lidocaine administered should not exceed 4.5 mg/kg (2.0 mg/lb) of body weight. Administration For medical use, apply topically for adequate control of symptoms. Apply to the tube prior to intubation. In dentistry, apply to previously dried oral mucosa. Subsequent removal of excess saliva with cotton rolls or saliva ejector minimizes dilution of the ointment, permits maximum penetration, and minimizes the possibility of swallowing the topical ointment. For use in connection with the insertion of new dentures, apply to all denture surfaces contacting mucosa.",,DailyMed,True,,,Oral

The total quantity to be administered during the period of illness will depend upon the severity and progression of the acidosis. The intravenous dosage of Tham Solution (tromethamine injection) may be estimated from the buffer base deficit of the extracellular fluid in mEq/liter determined by means of the Siggaard-Andersen nomogram. The following formula is intended as a general guide: Tham Solution (mL of 0.3 M) Required = Body Weight (kg) X Base Deficit (mEq/liter) X 1.1* Thus, a 70 kg patient with a buffer base deficit (“negative base excess”) of 5 mEq/liter would require 70 x 5 x 1.1 = 385 mL of Tham Solution containing 13.9 g (115 mEq) of tromethamine. Correction of Metabolic Acidosis Associated with Cardiac Bypass Surgery: An adverse dose of approximately 9.0 mL/kg (324 mg/kg) has been used in clinical studies with Tham Solution (tromethamine injection). This is equivalent to a total dose of 630 mL (189 mEq) for 70 kg patient. A total single dose of 500 mL (150 mEq) is considered adequate for most adults. Larger single doses (up to 1000 mL) may be required in unusually severe cases. It is recommended that individual doses should not exceed 500 mg/kg (227 mg/lb) over a period of not less than one hour. Thus, for a 70 kg (154 pound) patient the dose should not exceed a maximum of 35 g per hour (1078 mL of a 0.3 M solution). The amount of Tham Solution used to correct this acidity ranges from 0.5 to 2.5 g (15 to 77 mL of a 0.3 M solution) added to each 500 mL of ACD blood used for priming the pump-oxygenator. Clinical experience indicates that 2 g (62 mL of a 0.3 M solution) added to 500 mL of ACD blood is usually adequate. Correction of Metabolic Acidosis Associated with Cardiac Arrest: In the treatment of cardiac arrest, Tham Solution should be given at the same time that other standard resuscitative measures, including manual systole, are being applied. If the chest is open, Tham Solution is injected directly into the ventricular cavity. From 2 to 6 g (62 to 185 mL of a 0.3 M solution) should be injected immediately. Do not inject into the cardiac muscle. If the chest is not open, from 3.6 to 10.8 g (111 to 333 mL of a 0.3 M solution) should be injected immediately into a larger peripheral vein.

,,,,150 mg,,,"Store Succinylcholine Chloride Injection, USP with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product. Adults For Short Surgical Procedures The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg Succinylcholine Chloride Injection given intravenously. The optimum dose will vary among individuals and may be from 0.3 to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. A 5 to 10 mg test dose may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time (see PRECAUTIONS ). For Long Surgical Procedures The dose of succinylcholine administered by infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. The average rate for an adult ranges between 2.5 and 4.3 mg per minute. Solutions containing from 1 to 2 mg per mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous infusion. The more dilute solution (1 mg per mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of the drug and, hence, of relaxation. This intravenous solution containing 1 mg per mL may be administered at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation. Intermittent intravenous injections of succinylcholine may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further injections of 0.04 to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required. Pediatrics For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of succinylcholine is 2 mg/kg for infants and small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the dose is 1 mg/kg (see BOX WARNING and PRECAUTIONS : Pediatric Use). For example, the usual adult IV dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2-3 mg/kg in neonates and infants to 6 months and 1-2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Intramuscular Use If necessary, succinylcholine may be given intramuscularly to infants, older pediatric patients or adults when a suitable vein is inaccessible. A dose of up to 3 to 4 mg/kg may be given, but not more than 150 mg total dose should be administered by this route. The onset of effect of succinylcholine given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes. Admixtures containing 1 to 2 mg/mL may be prepared by adding 1 g succinylcholine chloride injection to 1000 or 500 mL sterile solution, such as 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Admixtures of succinylcholine chloride injection must be used within 24 hours after preparation. Admixtures of succinylcholine chloride injection should be prepared for single patient use only.

If trough response is inadequate, dividing the daily dose should be considered. In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic hypotension occasionally can occur following the initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets. If diuretic therapy cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 10 mg of fosinopril sodium tablets should be used with careful medical supervision for several hours and until blood pressure has stabilized (see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , Information for Patients and Drug Interactions ).

A lower starting dose or slower titration may be used. (2.2) Hypertension: Start at 6.25 mg twice daily and increase if needed for blood pressure control to 12.5 mg then 25 mg twice daily over intervals of 1 to 2 weeks. The recommended starting dose of COREG is 3.125 mg twice daily for 2 weeks. If tolerated, patients may have their dose increased to 6.25, 12.5, and 25 mg twice daily over successive intervals of at least 2 weeks. A maximum dose of 50 mg twice daily has been administered to patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure weighing over 85 kg (187 lbs). It is recommended that COREG be started at 6.25 mg twice daily and increased after 3 to 10 days, based on tolerability, to 12.5 mg twice daily, then again to the target dose of 25 mg twice daily. A lower starting dose may be used (3.125 mg twice daily) and/or the rate of up-titration may be slowed if clinically indicated (e.g., due to low blood pressure or heart rate, or fluid retention). The recommended starting dose of COREG is 6.25 mg twice daily. If this dose is tolerated, using standing systolic pressure measured about 1 hour after dosing as a guide, the dose should be maintained for 7 to 14 days, and then increased to 12.5 mg twice daily if needed, based on trough blood pressure, again using standing systolic pressure one hour after dosing as a guide for tolerance. This dose should also be maintained for 7 to 14 days and can then be adjusted upward to 25 mg twice daily if tolerated and needed.

Initial dosing is generally 2 mg/day. Dose increases should then occur at intervals not less than 24 hours, in increments of 1 to 2 mg/day, as tolerated, to a recommended dose of 4 to 8 mg/day. Efficacy has been demonstrated in a range of 4 to 16 mg/day [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. However, doses above 6 mg/day for twice daily dosing were not demonstrated to be more efficacious than lower doses, were associated with more extrapyramidal symptoms and other adverse effects, and are generally not recommended. In a single study supporting once-daily dosing, the efficacy results were generally stronger for 8 mg than for 4 mg. The safety of doses above 16 mg/day has not been evaluated in clinical trials. Maintenance TherapyWhile it is unknown how long a patient with schizophrenia should remain on risperidone, the effectiveness of risperidone 2 mg/day to 8 mg/day at delaying relapse was demonstrated in a controlled trial in patients who had been clinically stable for at least 4 weeks and were then followed for a period of 1 to 2 years[see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. When switching schizophrenic patients from depot antipsychotics, initiate risperidone therapy in place of the next scheduled injection. 2.2Bipolar Mania Usual DoseAdultsRisperidone should be administered on a once-daily schedule, starting with 2 mg to 3 mg per day. Dosage adjustments, if indicated, should occur at intervals of not less than 24 hours and in dosage increments/decrements of 1 mg per day, as studied in the short-term, placebo-controlled trials. In these trials, short-term (3 week) anti-manic efficacy was demonstrated in a flexible dosage range of 1 to 6 mg per day [see Clinical Studies (14.2, 14.3)]. Risperidone doses higher than 6 mg per day were not studied.",,DailyMed,False,,,Oral

KETOROLAC TROMETHAMINE INJECTION Ketorolac tromethamine injection may be used as a single or multiple dose on a regular or “as needed” schedule for the management of moderately severe, acute pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level, usually in a postoperative setting. When administering ketorolac tromethamine injection, the intravenous bolus must be given over no less than 15 seconds. The intramuscular administration should be given slowly and deeply into the muscle. Single-Dose Treatment: The following regimen should be limited to single administration use only Intramuscular Dosing • Patients <65 years of age: One dose of 60 mg. • Patients ≥65 years of age, renally impaired and/or less than 50 kg (110 lbs) of body weight: One dose of 30 mg. Intravenous Dosing • Patients <65 years of age: One dose of 30 mg. • Patients ≥65 years of age, renally impaired and/or less than 50 kg (110 lbs) of body weight:One dose of 15 mg. Multiple-Dose Treatment (Intravenous or Intramuscular) • Patients <65 years of age: The recommended dose is 30 mg ketorolac tromethamine injection every 6 hours. The maximum daily dose for these populations should not exceed 120 mg. • For patients ≥65 years of age, renally impaired patients (see WARNINGS ), and patients less than 50 kg (110 lbs): The recommended dose is 15 mg ketorolac tromethamine injection every 6 hours. The maximum daily dose for these populations should not exceed 60 mg. Consideration should be given to supplementing these regimens with low doses of opioids ""as needed"" unless otherwise contraindicated.

,,,,,12,,"Metoprolol tartrate tablets should be taken with or immediately following meals. The usual initial dosage of Metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 mg daily in single or divided doses, whether used alone or added to a diuretic. In general, the maximum effect of any given dosage level will be apparent after 1 week of therapy. The effective dosage range of Metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 to 450 mg per day. Dosages above 450 mg per day have not been studied. While once-daily dosing is effective and can maintain a reduction in blood pressure throughout the day, lower doses (especially 100 mg) may not maintain a full effect at the end of the 24-hour period, and larger or more frequent daily doses may be required. Metoprolol tartrate tablets should be taken with or immediately following meals. The usual initial dosage of Metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 mg daily, given in two divided doses. The effective dosage range of Metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 to 400 mg per day. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied. Treatment in this early phase should begin with the intravenous administration of three bolus injections of 5 mg of metoprolol tartrate each; the injections should be given at approximately 2-minute intervals. In patients who tolerate the full intravenous dose (15 mg), metoprolol tartrate tablets, 50 mg every 6 hours, should be initiated 15 minutes after the last intravenous dose and continued for 48 hours. Thereafter, patients should receive a maintenance dosage of 100 mg twice daily (see Late Treatment below). Patients who appear not to tolerate the full intravenous dose should be started on metoprolol tartrate tablets either 25 mg or 50 mg every 6 hours (depending on the degree of intolerance) 15 minutes after the last intravenous dose or as soon as their clinical condition allows. Patients with contraindications to treatment during the early phase of suspected or definite myocardial infarction, patients who appear not to tolerate the full early treatment, and patients in whom the physician wishes to delay therapy for any other reason should be started on metoprolol tartrate tablets, 100 mg twice daily, as soon as their clinical condition allows. Geriatric patients (>65 years): In general, use a low initial starting dose in elderly patients given their greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Method of administration: For oral treatment, the tablets should be swallowed un-chewed with a glass of water. Metoprolol Tartrate should always be taken in standardized relation with meals. If the physician asks the patient to take Metoprolol Tartrate either before breakfast or with breakfast, then the patient should continue taking Metoprolol Tartrate with the same schedule during the course of therapy.",,,,,,Oral
