    "indications": "Short-term memory is also called short-term storage, primary memory, or active memory. The term indicates different systems of memory involved in retaining pieces of information, or memory chunks, for a relatively short time, typically up to 30 seconds. In contrast, long-term memory may hold indefinite information. However, the difference is not just the time variable but also their overall functionality. Nevertheless, the 2 systems are closely related.\n\nPractically, short-term memory functions as a temporary scratchpad for recalling a limited amount of data, typically around 7 ± 2 items, in the verbal domain, based on George Miller's concept. This information originates from the sensory register and can be processed through attention and recognition. In contrast, information collected in long-term memory storage consists of memories for performing actions or skills, such as procedural memories (knowing how), and memories of facts, rules, concepts, and events, such as declarative memories (knowing that). Declarative memory includes semantic and episodic memory. The former concerns broad knowledge of facts, rules, concepts, and propositions (general knowledge), whereas the latter concerns personal and experienced events and the contexts in which they occurred (personal recollection).\n[1]\n\nAlthough short-term memory is closely related to the concept of working memory, both are distinct entities. Short-term memory is a set of storage systems, whereas working memory indicates the cognitive operations and executive functions associated with the organization and manipulation of stored information. Nevertheless, the terms short-term memory and working memory are often used interchangeably. Short-term memory must also be distinguished from sensory memory, such as the acoustical echoic and iconic visual memories, which are shorter in duration, typically fractions of a second, and reflect the stimulus's original sensation or perception. In other words, sensory memory is specific to the stimulus modality of presentation. This raw sensory information undergoes processing and, upon processing to short-term, is expressed in a format different from that perceived initially.\n\nThe famous Atkinson and Shiffrin (or multi-store) model, proposed in the late 1960s, explains the functional correlations between different types of memory.\n[2]\nMany studies demonstrated the anatomical and functional distinctions between memory processes, neural correlates, and the functioning of short-term and long-term memory subsystems. In light of these findings, several memory models have been postulated.\n[3]\n[4]\nAlthough some authors suggested a single memory system encompassing both short- and long-term storage after 50 years, the Atkinson and Shiffrin model remains a valid approach for explaining the memory dynamics.\n[5]\nIn light of recent research, however, the model has several problems, mostly concerning the characteristics of short-term memory, the relationship between short-term and working memory, and the transition from short- to long-term memory.\n\nShort-Term Memory\n\nShort-term memory is a storage system that includes several subsystems with limited capacity. Rather than a limitation, this restriction is an evolutionary survival advantage, as paying attention to limited but essential information, excluding confounding factors, is important. A classic example in biology is prey, which must focus on the hostile environment to recognize a possible attack by the predator. Given the functional peculiarities of short-term memory, which involves the collection of sensory information, the subsystems are closely related to the modalities of sensory memory. Consequently, several sensory-associated subsystems have been postulated, including the visuospatial, phonological (auditory-verbal), tactile, and olfactory domains. These subsystems involve patterns and functional interconnections with the corresponding cortical and subcortical areas and centers.\n\nThe Concept of Working Memory\n\nIn 1974, Baddeley and Hitch developed an alternative model called working memory.\n[6]\nThis model does not exclude the modal model but rather enriches the contents. The short-term store can be used to characterize the functioning of the working memory. Working memory refers to the entire theoretical framework of the structures and processes used for storing and temporarily manipulating information, of which short-term memory is only a component. In other words, short-term memory is a functional storage element, whereas working memory is a set of processes involving storage phases. Working memory is constantly used when we have to understand new information, solve a problem, or make an argument, and it is the cognitive strategy for achieving short-term goals. The importance of this type of operating system of memory is demonstrated by the evidence showing that working memory deficits are associated with several developmental disorders of learning, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, dyslexia, and specific language impairment.\n[7]\n\nA recent study on working and short-term memory in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder suggested that these children had an inadequate hemodynamic response in a region of the brain that underlies phonological working memory. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy is a cost-effective, noninvasive neuroimaging technique that localizes and quantifies neural activation patterns related to executive functions.\n[8]\nAnother study suggested that working memory impairment and attention lapsing are general features of psychotic disorders. Findings regarding capacity estimates from the Change Localization and Detection tasks related to functional capacity and outcome also implied that these methods may be useful in a clinical context.\n[9]\n\nShort-Term and Long-Term Memory\n\nShort-term and long-term memory can be distinguished based on storage capacity and duration. Short-term memory\nhas limitations in the amount and duration of information maintained. In contrast, long-term memory features a seemingly unlimited capacity that can last years. The functional distinctions between memory storage systems and the exact mechanisms for how memories transfer from short-term to long-term memory remain controversial. Do short- and long-term memory represent 1 or more systems with specific subsystems? Although short-term memory probably represents a substructure of long-term memory, a form of long-term–activated storage, rather than looking for a physical division, verifying the mechanisms involved in transitioning from short-term to long-term memory seems appropriate. Although the classic multi-modal model proposed that the storage of short-term memories occurs automatically without manipulation, the matter seems more involved. The phenomenon concerns quantitative (number of memories) and qualitative (quality of memory) features.\n\nRegarding quantitative data, although the number of Miller of 7 ± 2 items identifies the number of elements included among individual slots, grouping memory bits into larger chunks (chunking) can allow for greater storage capacity. The qualitative issue, or memory modulation within processing, is fascinating. Short-term memory elements undergo processing, providing a sort of editing involving each element's fragmentation (chunking) and re-elaboration. This phase of memory processing is called encoding and can condition subsequent processing, including storage and retrieval\n.\nThe encoding process encompasses automatic (without conscious awareness) and effortful processing (through attention, practice, and thought) and allows us to retrieve information to make decisions and answer questions. Three pathways are followed during the encoding step—visual (information represented as a picture), acoustic (information represented as a sound), and semantic encoding (the meaning of the information). These processes interconnect, breaking down information into various components. During recovery, the pathway that has produced the coding facilitates the recovery of the other components through a chain reaction. A particular perfume, for instance, makes us recall a specific episode or image. The encoding process affects the recovery, but the recovery undergoes potential changes that can alter the initial content.\n\nIn neurofunctional terms, the difference is the occurrence in long-term memory of a series of events that must definitively fix the engram(s). This effect occurs through the establishment of neural networks and is expressed as a neurofunctional phenomenon, including long-term potentiation, which is an increase in the strength of the neural transmission deriving from the strengthening of synaptic connections. This process requires gene expression and the synthesis of new proteins and is related to long-lasting structural alterations in the synapses (synaptic consolidation) of the brain areas involved, such as the hippocampus in declarative memories.\n\nThe Role of the Hippocampal Network\n\nHippocampal neurogenesis regulates the maintenance of long-term potentiation.\n[10]\nHowever, the hippocampal network, including the parahippocampal gyrus, hippocampus, and neocortical areas, is not the storage site for memories but plays a crucial role in forming new memories and their subsequent reactivation. The hippocampus appears to have a limited capacity but acquires information quickly and automatically. Over time, the initially available information is permanent in other brain structures, particularly the cortex), independently from the activity of the hippocampus itself. The crucial mechanism of this transfer involves the reactivation (replay) of neural activity configurations.\n\nIn other words, the connected hippocampus and the medial temporal structures are crucial for holding an event as a whole as they distribute memory traces in an organized manner. The operating system can store, organize, process, and recover hardware files through different software. This hippocampal-guided reactivation (retrieval) leads to the creation of direct connections between the cortical traces and then to the formation of an integrated representation in the neocortex, including the visual association cortex for visual memory, the temporal cortex for auditory memory, and the left lateral temporal cortex for knowledge of word meanings. Moreover, the hippocampus has other specific tasks, such as spatial memory organization.\n\nRecent reviews summarized the progress of hippocampal circuits and functions based on sharp-wave ripples. These ripples are crucial for consolidating spatial, episodic, and social memories in different hippocampal-cortical pathways. Dysregulation of sharp-wave ripples contributes to cognitive impairments in neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases.\n[11]\nOther brain areas are involved in memory processes; for example, learning motor skills has links to the activation of the cerebellar regions and brainstem nuclei. Learning perceptive activities, including improvements in processing perceptive stimuli essential in everyday life activities such as understanding spoken and written language, involves basal ganglia and sensory and associative cortices. In contrast, learning cognitive skills related to problem-solving involves the medial temporal lobes.",
    "mechanism": "Different clinical conditions, including strokes, brain aneurysms, traumatic brain injuries, primitive or metastatic neoplasms, and infectious diseases, may impair various components of short-term memory. However, the damage to short-term memory is seldom selective. For example, aneurysm rupture can lead to short-term and long-term memory loss. Apart from diseases that induce short-term memory alterations through direct neural damage, a wide range of medical conditions such as systemic infections; thyroid diseases; surgery, including neuroinflammation-mediated postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction; or psychiatric diseases, including depression; or psychological trauma can also impact short-term memory.\n[12]\nIn this regard, evidence shows that violence during childhood impairs cognitive processes, including memory (psychogenic amnesia). Cancer treatments, including radiation and chemotherapy, can induce short-term damage through a complex neuroinflammation mechanism.\n[13]\n[14]\n\nPrevious studies mentioned that sports-related concussions occur in approximately 21% of college athletes, with implications for long-term cognitive impairments in working memory.\n[15]\nFurthermore, a neuropsychological study on the effects of Boxing Upon Athletes' Memory suggested that 1 year of boxing training can impair the boxers' working memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory. In conclusion, boxers should strengthen their head protection during training to prevent frequent impacts to the head.\n[16]\nNeurodegenerative conditions are paramount causes of memory impairment. For instance, 1 of the first signs of dementia is short-term memory loss.\n\nIn particular, memory loss without interference in daily life or independent function is the main feature of mild cognitive impairment, which represents the stage between the expected cognitive decline of normal aging and the more severe decline observed in Alzheimer disease. A recent study showed that the difference between mild cognitive impairment and visual short-term memory from normal cognitive aging is evident only where the spatial configuration of stimuli is retained at original locations. Findings also revealed a reduced ability to inhibit irrelevant items and location priming (by repetition) deficits. However, visual short-term memory for simultaneous items declines significantly in normal aging but is not influenced differently by spatial or object configuration change.\n[17]\nMoreover, alterations in different memory domains have been shown in Parkinson disease, in those affected by Huntington disease, and in primary progressive aphasia.\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n\nRecent reviews reported impairments of executive function in primary progressive aphasia. Executive functions pertain to a set of cognitive processes, specifically shifting, inhibition, and updating of working memory, and are involved in the cognitive control of behavior. Results revealed that the primary progressive aphasia variant and disease duration were significant moderators of performance, whereas task modality and years of education were not. The non-fluent or agrammatic primary progressive aphasia and the logopenic primary progressive aphasia variants were similarly affected, but the semantic variant was affected to a lesser extent.\n[21]\nAnother study described the semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia as a progressive loss of semantic knowledge impairing the ability to name and recognize the meaning of words, which can be improved through learning therapy.\n[22]\n\nOther conditions that impair memory tasks include alcohol and drug abuse, such as marijuana; heavy cigarette smoking; sleep deprivation; severe stress; and vitamin B12 deficiency. Prolonged alcohol intake can lead to Korsakoff syndrome, which is a complex amnestic disorder with neuropsychological sequelae caused by vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency. In addition to alcohol, other causes can lead to vitamin B1 deficiency (non-alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome) with related memory disorders, including dietary deficiencies, prolonged vomiting, and eating disorders. Korsakoff-like amnestic syndromes have also been observed after brain lesions involving the anteromedian thalamus and hippocampus.\n[23]\n\nRecent reviews have emphasized the crucial role of the prefrontal cortex in mediating executive functions and organizing a person's thinking, decision, and behavior, particularly to stress. Stress activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, releasing prefrontal neurotransmitters, with dopamine neurotransmission responding as a stress modulator. Different reviews showed that stressful events are associated with increased dopamine concentrations in the medial prefrontal cortex. This increase affects working memory by causing an inability to process information selectively and impairing cognitive function.\n[24]\n\nAmong other causes of memory impairment, a common adverse effect of electroconvulsive therapy is short-term memory alteration during treatment. Another notable concern is medication-induced memory loss. The list of drugs implicated includes benzodiazepines, antiepileptic drugs, opioids, and tricyclic antidepressants.\n[25]\n[26]\n[27]\nLimited evidence, primarily from observational data and case reports, is available regarding statin use and memory loss. Most of these drugs, such as benzodiazepines, impair memory processing and, in turn, can present an obstacle to the consolidation of information.\n[28]\n[29]",
    "monitoring": "Different approaches are useful for evaluating short-term memory domains. For instance, the verbal component is assessed through simple tests based on the recall of words or digits. The simple span tasks approach, or short-term memory tasks, examines the storage of either verbal (phonological) or visuospatial information. Alternatively, more complex methods can be employed, such as those based on serial position effects in the immediate serial recall. Population-specific approaches are used, particularly in children. In this setting, short-term memory performance is investigated within the framework of working memory using tools such as the Automated Working Memory Assessment and the Working Memory Test Battery for Children.\n[48]\n[49]\n\nRecent reviews have highlighted the use of automated neuropsychological test batteries, such as the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), for assessing working memory, which can aid in diagnosing mild cognitive impairment. CANTAB subtests, including spatial span, spatial working memory, and rapid visual information processing, can be used as suitable assessment tools for diagnosing mild cognitive impairment in clinical settings.\n[50]\nAlthough memory is investigated among cognitive performances by validated instruments such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), specific tools have been developed for assessing short-term memory impairment and providing information about the degree of memory impairment. The Short-Term Memory Recall Test and its simplified version can be useful for identifying memory impairment as a pre-dementia state. In contrast, the Temple Assessment of Language and Short-term Memory in Aphasia (TALSA) is a tool for investigating short-term impairment in post-stroke aphasia. Other tools can help evaluate memory alterations in different clinical conditions of progressive cognitive decline. For instance, the California Verbal Learning Test-3 (CVLT-3) is useful for distinguishing memory disorders of Alzheimer disease from those of Huntington disease.\n[51]\n[52]\n\nA recent study has outlined screening procedures for early Alzheimer disease to identify patients who fulfill clinical and biomarker criteria efficiently. These procedures include performance on the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) and Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS).\n[53]\nFurther diagnostic examinations must focus on the cause of memory decline. Instrumental investigations, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan, or laboratory examinations, such as vitamin B12, may be necessary. Previous radiologic studies have described the role of MRI in ruling out underlying causes of cognitive deterioration and revealing patterns of atrophy with a predictive value for certain types of dementias. Although these patterns are not specific or unique to each disease, they can help confirm diagnostic suspicion or identify certain processes.\n[54]",
    "administration": "Several strategies have been proposed to enhance memory tasks, including behavioral and non-behavioral approaches. Behavioral approaches, or cognitive training, are mostly focused on the maintenance rehearsal, which facilitates memory processing through repetitive stimuli, and the elaborative rehearsal, which entails associating new information with stored knowledge and analyzing it. Several proposed behavioral strategies include the combination of Tai Chi movements and breathing. However, further research and controlled studies are required to confirm their real benefit. Concerning pharmacological approaches, although commonly prescribed, drugs approved to manage memory symptoms of Alzheimer disease, such as cholinesterase inhibitors, have not demonstrated significant benefits in slowing down or preventing the progression of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer disease.\n[55]\n[56]\n[57]\n\nApart from the complex strategies used in specific settings and when the deficit appears to be very clear, involving different domains and other types of memory, short-term memory training is accomplished using simple expedients. For example, rhymes can help children memorize numbers, months of the year, and other sequences. This strategy works by attaching a word, phrase, or image to an object. In practice, this is the same process that we put into practice when we choose a password. Similarly, memory games involving short exposure to objects, such as pictures of animals, can work to exercise memory.\n\nResearchers have designed more complex training programs for specific contexts. These non-pharmacological approaches are crucial in cases of neurodegenerative conditions when no effective therapies are available and in those when the impairment is not severe and can still be slowed down or stopped. For example, in cases of mild cognitive impairment, for which no medications currently have approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration, computer-based memory training programs are adopted. Computer brain fitness training can also be combined with wellness education programs and physical exercise, such as yoga. According to a study, Kundalini yoga training has a more significant impact on stress-related hippocampal connectivity. In contrast, memory enhancement training improves hippocampal sensory integration, supporting better memory reliability in women with subjective memory decline and cardiovascular risk factors.\n[58]\nAnother study focused on the effect of exercise interventions on subdomains of executive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment and found that exercise significantly improved 3 subdomains of EF in mild cognitive impairment, particularly mind-body exercise. Moreover, exercise training of at least 4 weeks with a frequency of 3 to 4 times a week tends to have a significant impact.\n[59]\nAnother study assessed the effects of long-term Wuqinxi exercise on working memory in older adults with mild cognitive impairment, and findings suggested that this exercise may be an effective intervention in delaying or preventing mild cognitive impairment progression to Alzheimer disease.\n[60]\n\nOn the other hand, web-based cognitive training, consisting of 30 internet sessions conducted 4 to 5 times a week, may be useful in modifying memory processing in Parkinson disease. Furthermore, the effect of virtual reality in a recent study showed improvement in executive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. A recent study on music therapy revealed that the assessment of music-related memory can be systematically categorized as assessing short-term or long-term memory and explicit or implicit memory. Comprehensive information about music-related memory is valuable for understanding dementia patients. This information is crucial for planning and applying musical experiences in music therapy.\n[61]\n[62]\n\nAnother study focused on improving the naming ability of patients with a semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia through Errorless Learning Therapy. This effect may be due to the relative preservation of episodic memory, but the benefit is not maintained over time, probably due to the absence of consolidation.\n[22]\nFurthermore, the Train the Brain program is described in a study as a combined motor and cognitive intervention that markedly improves cognitive functions in patients with mild cognitive impairment. The beneficial impact on cognitive functions was preserved at the 14-month follow-up, with more significant effects in low-educated individuals compared to high-educated individuals and in women compared to men.\n[63]\n\nApart from cognitive training, non-behavioral strategies concern transcranial direct current stimulation in short-term memory impairment due to primary progressive aphasia. In contrast, current research is being conducted on the effects of nutraceuticals, such as thymoquinone or green tea, against Alzheimer disease–related short-term memory decline and tryptophan-tyrosine–related peptides, such as lactolin, to mitigate stress-induced memory alterations.\n[64]\n[65]\n[66]\nAlthough several studies have shown that Ginkgo biloba can improve the risk of short-term memory impairment, the scientific evidence is limited.\n[67]\n\nA recent study examined the relationship between changes in brain activity associated with working memory and assessment scales of memory scores in amnestic mild cognitive impairment before and after moxibustion therapy. Findings showed that moxibustion treatment improved memory in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and was associated with the activation of brain regions such as the insula, lingual gyrus, posterior cingulate gyrus, postcentral gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and thalamus, which may be a significant process by which moxibustion enhances memory function.\n[68]",
    "adverse_effects": "Depending on its severity, short-term memory loss can lead to complications, significantly impacting the patient's social interactions. These complications may manifest as missing appointments, forgetting conversations, and a decline in communication with friends and family, resulting in withdrawal from the community without active support. In the latter stages, patients may struggle to complete complex tasks of daily living, such as grocery shopping and bill payments, requiring additional assistance. In severe cases of memory loss, patients can be a danger to themselves, such as forgetting to turn off the stove, getting lost in familiar places, and being unable to find their way home. When coupled with comorbid medical conditions, patients may forget to take medications or forget that they have already taken medications; hence, they may take multiple doses of their medications, leading to further complications. Activities of daily living are also compromised as the patient may forget to eat, bathe, or have difficulty dressing. Eventually, patients may become entirely dependent on others and may require relocation to a nursing home for adequate care."
