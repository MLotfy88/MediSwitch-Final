In contrast, symptoms of the depressive reaction probably stem from potentiation of CNS effects by MAOIs and include respiratory depression, cyanosis, hypotension, and coma.

Symptoms of the excitatory reaction may include agitation, headache, diaphoresis, hyperpyrexia, flushing, shivering, myoclonus, rigidity, tremor, diarrhea, hypertension, tachycardia, seizures, and coma. Death has occurred in some cases. In contrast, symptoms of the depressive reaction probably stem from potentiation of CNS effects by MAOIs and include respiratory depression, cyanosis, hypotension, and coma. There have also been reports of serotonin syndrome, which is a rare but serious and potentially fatal condition thought to result from hyperstimulation of brainstem 5-HT1A and 2A receptors, with symptoms similar to the excitatory reaction described above. Some opioids such as fentanyl, meperidine, methadone, tapentadol, and tramadol can inhibit serotonin reuptake and are more likely to cause serotonin syndrome. However, serotonin syndrome has also occurred with other opioids.', NULL, 'Until more information is available, concomitant use of ozanimod with opioid analgesics should be avoided when possible.', NULL, 'Until more information is available, concomitant use of ozanimod with opioid analgesics should be avoided when possible.
