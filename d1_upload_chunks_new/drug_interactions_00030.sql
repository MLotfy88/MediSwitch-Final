The use of quinolones has been associated with disturbances in blood glucose homeostasis possibly stemming from effects on pancreatic beta cell ATP-sensitive potassium channels that regulate insulin secretion. Both hyperglycaemia and hypoglycemia have been reported, usually in diabetic patients receiving concomitant treatment with an oral hypoglycemic agent (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin. Although hyperglycaemia is significantly more common and infection itself may be an underlying risk factor, hypoglycemia may cause greater morbidity and mortality.', 'DDInter', 'Blood glucose should be closely monitored whenever quinolones are prescribed to diabetic patients, especially if they are elderly, have renal impairment, or are severely ill. Patients should be apprised of the increased risk of dysglycemia and be particularly alert to potential signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia such as headache, dizziness, drowsiness, nervousness, confusion, tremor, hunger, weakness, perspiration, palpitation, and tachycardia. If hypoglycemia occurs, patients should initiate appropriate remedial therapy immediately, discontinue the quinolone, and contact their physician. Alternative antibiotics may need to be considered.', 'Antagonism', 'Blood glucose should be closely monitored whenever quinolones are prescribed to diabetic patients, especially if they are elderly, have renal impairment, or are severely ill.', 'Moderate', 'pharmacodynamic', NULL, 'https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/3095/', '', 'Simvastatin, Guar gum, Rosuvastatin', '', 1767369485);
