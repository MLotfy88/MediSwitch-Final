Administration of ifosfamide can cause CNS toxicity, which necessitates careful monitoring of the patient. Neurologic manifestations include somnolence, confusion, hallucinations, blurred vision, psychotic behavior, extrapyramidal symptoms, urinary incontinence, seizures, and in some instances, coma. There have also been reports of peripheral neuropathy. Ifosfamide neurotoxicity may occur within a few hours to a few days after initial administration and typically resolves within 48 to 72 hours of ifosfamide discontinuation.",

If ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy occurs, both ifosfamide and non-essential concomitant CNS agents should be discontinued.
