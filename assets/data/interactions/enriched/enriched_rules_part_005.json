In general, consumption of ginseng supplements and large amounts of ginseng should preferably be avoided during use of coagulation-modifying agents.

Close clinical and laboratory observation for hematologic complications is recommended.",

However, it should rarely lead to clinically significant deficiency because the body (primarily the liver) usually has a copious supply of vitamin B12 that can sustain a person for several years in the absence of adequate intake. As for the treatment of B12 deficiency-related anemia, non-oral routes of administration (e.g., parenteral, intranasal, sublingual) are generally preferred, which would bypass the potential interaction.",

However, there were no changes in INR values or the overall safety profile of warfarin.

Theoretically, MAOIs may potentiate the serotonergic activity of 5-HT1 receptor agonists and increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, which is a rare but serious and potentially fatal condition thought to result from hyperstimulation of brainstem 5-HT1A and 2A receptors. The mechanism is an additive pharmacodynamic effect resulting from MAOI inhibition of serotonin metabolism. Symptoms of the serotonin syndrome may include mental status changes such as irritability, altered consciousness, confusion, hallucinations, and coma; autonomic dysfunction such as tachycardia, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, shivering, blood pressure lability, and mydriasis; neuromuscular abnormalities such as hyperreflexia, myoclonus, tremor, rigidity, and ataxia; and gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.",
