    "clinical_significance": "Understanding the physiology of uterine contractions allows clinicians to use targeted therapy for both the induction and cessation of labor. Commonly used medications for induction of labor include oxytocin, misoprostol, and dinoprostone. Because uterine contractions dually function to minimize postpartum bleeding, these are the same medications used to manage postpartum hemorrhage. Carboprost, an analog of PGF2a, is an additional medication used to manage postpartum hemorrhage, not used for the induction of labor.\n\nOxytocin is commonly used in modern obstetric practice to increase contractions when the labor process has failed to promote vaginal delivery.\n[23]\nProstaglandins are active contractile agents, and their analogs are combined with mifepristone (an antiprogestin)for uterine evacuation during early and second-trimester pregnancy.[24][25][24] Misoprostol is cheaper than gemeprost and does not need refrigeration, so it is the prostaglandin of choice.\n\nIn 2013, the FDA approved the use of progesterone supplementation (hydroxyprogesterone caproate) during pregnancy to reduce the risk of recurrent preterm birth in women with a history of at least 1 prior spontaneous preterm delivery.\n[24]\nIt is protective against recurrent preterm birth as the rate of recurrent preterm birth with its use decreases to 25% to 31% compared with 33% to 47% in placebo controls.\n[25]\n\nMedications used to stop preterm labor antagonize uterine contractions. Commonly used tocolytics include nifedipine, terbutaline, magnesium sulfate, indomethacin, and atosiban. Figure 1 summarizes the medications used for induction of labor and tocolysis. Of these tocolytic agents, beta sympathomimetics, oxytocin receptor antagonists, and calcium channel blockers have the most promising data regarding efficacy.\n[26]\nMagnesium sulfate is a weak tocolytic but not used for tocolysis. It is administered to lower the risk of neurologic comorbidities in babies born at <32 weeks gestation. There is evidence that NSAIDs and CCBs are better than magnesium and beta sympathomimetics in terms of neonatal and maternal outcomes and maternal complications.\n[27]\nHowever, NSAIDs may lead to side effects such as oligohydramnios, renal failure, necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hemorrhage, and closure of the patent ductus arteriosus.\n[28]\nHence, calcium channel blockers are the drug of choice for tocolysis beyond 32 weeks gestation. CCBs can lead to maternal hypotension and tachycardia. Tocolytics are not recommended beyond 34 weeks gestation as their risks outweigh the risks of premature delivery.\n\nUnderstanding the normal pattern of contractions is also useful in defining the arrest of labor, which has different management based on the stage. For example, an arrested latent phase is an indication of augmentation with oxytocin, while an arrested active phase is an indication of the cesarean section. Defining the true arrest of labor requires analysis of the adequacy of uterine contractions, which requires the use of an intrauterine pressure catheter. Active phase arrest has specific requirements, which include 4 or more hours of adequate contractions or 6 or more hours of inadequate contractions. These definitions are essential for clinicians because they dictate management algorithms."
