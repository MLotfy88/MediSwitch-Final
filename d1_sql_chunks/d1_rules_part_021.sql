Most antimicrobials, with the exception of the rifamycins and possibly griseofulvin, do not induce hepatic enzymes and have not been shown to significantly increase the clearance of oral contraceptive estrogens. Some investigators believe that antimicrobials interfere with the enterohepatic recirculation of estrogens by decreasing bacterial hydrolytic enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract that are responsible for regenerating parent estrogen molecules following first-pass metabolism. It is possible that a small number of women may be more susceptible to contraceptive failure and, consequently, are more sensitive to the effects of antimicrobials on estrogen disposition in vivo, but risk factors or genetic predispositions have yet to be identified.', NULL, 'Until further data are available, women using oral contraceptives should be advised of the risk of breakthrough bleeding and unintended pregnancy during concomitant antimicrobial therapy.', NULL, 'Until further data are available, women using oral contraceptives should be advised of the risk of breakthrough bleeding and unintended pregnancy during concomitant antimicrobial therapy.

The exact mechanism of interaction is unknown but may involve ritonavir induction of glucuronosyltransferase and/or CYP450 hydroxylation.

If a combination oral contraceptive pill is used, a regimen containing at least 50 mcg of ethinyl estradiol per day or equivalent should be selected. Although breakthrough bleeding is not necessarily indicative of low ethinyl estradiol serum levels or increased risk of ovulation, some clinicians suggest that women who experience breakthrough bleeding during enzyme-inducing therapy may be prescribed an increased dose of ethinyl estradiol above 50 mcg daily by combining more than one formulation of contraceptive pill if necessary. For emergency contraception in patients who have used an hepatic enzyme inducer in the past 4 weeks, a non-hormonal emergency contraceptive (e.g., copper intrauterine device) is considered preferable. If this is not possible, some authorities recommend that the usual dose of levonorgestrel (1.5 mg) should be doubled to 3 mg and taken as a single dose as soon as possible (within 72 hours of unprotected sexual intercourse). However, there are no data on efficacy, compliance, or side effects of this regimen.

Women using hormonal contraceptives should be advised of the risk of breakthrough bleeding and unintended pregnancy during concomitant therapy with St. John''s wort. Alternative or additional methods of birth control should be used during and for at least two weeks after short-term and 4 weeks after long-term (greater than 4 weeks) St. John''s wort therapy. If a combination oral contraceptive pill is used, a regimen containing at least 50 mcg of ethinyl estradiol per day or equivalent should be selected. Although breakthrough bleeding is not necessarily indicative of low ethinyl estradiol serum levels or increased risk of ovulation, some clinicians suggest that women who experience breakthrough bleeding during enzyme-inducing therapy may be prescribed an increased dose of ethinyl estradiol above 50 mcg daily by combining more than one formulation of contraceptive pill if necessary. For emergency contraception in patients who have used an hepatic enzyme inducer in the past 4 weeks, a non-hormonal emergency contraceptive (e.g., copper intrauterine device) is considered preferable. If this is not possible, some authorities recommend that the usual dose of levonorgestrel (1.5 mg) should be doubled to 3 mg and taken as a single dose as soon as possible (within 72 hours of unprotected sexual intercourse). However, there are no data on efficacy, compliance, or side effects of this regimen. For women with the etonogestrel subdermal implant, the addition of a barrier method is recommended during concomitant use and for 28 days after discontinuation of hepatic enzyme inducing drugs. It is recommended to remove the implant and to prescribe a nonhormonal method in women who require long-term treatment with hepatic enzyme inducing drugs. No precautions or recommendations are available for women using hormone-releasing intrauterine systems, but a significant interaction with these systems is thought to be unlikely due to their local action.

Because HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitors must be used in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin, and use of ribavirin has been associated with significant birth defects and fetal death, it is particularly important that patients not become pregnant during treatment. Therefore, systemic hormonal contraceptives should not be relied upon as an effective method of birth control in women of childbearing potential treated with HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitors. Two alternative, effective methods of contraception, which may include intrauterine devices and barrier methods, should be used during HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor treatment in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin.
