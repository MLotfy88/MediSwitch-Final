      "text": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a heritable\nconnective tissue disorder\nwith multi-system involvement\n[1]\nFirst characterized as a syndrome by French pediatrician Antoine Marfan in 1896\nClinical features vary along a spectrum typical of autosomal-dominant disorders\nAutosomal-dominant mutation in FBN1 gene (encodes collagen matrix protein fibrillin-1) on chromosome 15\n[1]\nThis results in cystic medial degeneration of the aortic tunica media (leading to increased risk of aortic aneurysm / dissection)\nThis also interferes with elastin deposition during extracellular matrix formation implicates in the elasticity of multiple tissue types\nMajority of cases (75%) are familial / inherited vs. minority (25%) are\nde novo\nmutations\nEstimated prevalence of 1/5000 individuals worldwide (equal between men and women)\n[1]\nLife expectancy for those diagnosed and treated is now close to that of non-MFS population (previously expected increase in patient mortality by third and fourth decades of life)",
