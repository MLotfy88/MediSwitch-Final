The risk of symptomatic hypotension is increased in the presence of marked volume and/or salt depletion.

Certain systemic reactions stemming from parenteral iron therapy are thought to be mediated by inflammatory substances such as bradykinin in response to iron-catalyzed generation of toxic free radicals. Since ACE inhibitors decrease the breakdown of kinins, it is conceivable that they may potentiate these reactions. Anaphylactic-type reactions, including fatalities, have followed the parenteral administration of iron dextran. Such reactions occur most often within the first several minutes of administration and are generally characterized by sudden onset of respiratory difficulty and/or cardiovascular collapse. The extent of risk for anaphylactic-type reactions following exposure to any specific iron dextran product is unknown, but may vary among the products due to differences in chemical characteristics.",
      "management_text": "Patients should be closely monitored during and after parenteral administration of iron dextran, regardless of whether they are being treated with an ACE inhibitor. This is particularly important in patients with a history of drug allergy or multiple drug allergies or an immune/inflammatory condition such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis. Resuscitation techniques and personnel trained in the detection and treatment of anaphylactic-type reactions should be readily available. Prior to the first therapeutic dose, a test dose corresponding to 25 mg iron should be injected gradually. Although anaphylactic reactions are usually evident within a few minutes, observe patients for at least one hour before administering the remainder of the therapeutic dose. Administration must be stopped immediately if signs of an anaphylactoid reaction are observed. Patients should also be closely monitored during each subsequent administration of iron dextran. Fatal reactions have occurred following the test dose and also in situations where the test dose was tolerated. According to some studies, non-dextran parenteral iron formulations may be associated with a lower risk of adverse effects, especially death and life-threatening reactions such as anaphylaxis, cardiac arrest, and respiratory depression.",

Liver enzymes and bilirubin should be measured prior to initiation of leflunomide/teriflunomide therapy and at least monthly for the first six months of treatment and every 6 to 8 weeks thereafter. Patients with preexisting liver disease or elevated baseline liver enzymes (i.e., ALT greater than two times ULN) should not receive leflunomide or teriflunomide. Patients who develop elevated serum ALT greater than three times ULN while receiving these medications should discontinue treatment and be given washout procedures with cholestyramine or activated charcoal to accelerate elimination of leflunomide's active metabolite from plasma, which otherwise may take up to two years. Follow-up monitoring should be conducted at least weekly until the ALT value is within normal range, and washout procedures repeated as necessary.

For patients with MF or PV who are stabilized on ruxolitinib 10 mg twice a day or greater and starting a potent CYP450 3A4 inhibitor, the ruxolitinib dose should be reduced by 50% (rounded up to the closest available tablet strength). For patients with MF or PV stabilized on a dose of 5 mg twice a day and starting fluconazole (at a dose of 200 mg per day or less), the ruxolitinib dose should be reduced to 5 mg once a day. For patients with MF or PV stabilized on ruxolitinib 5 mg once a day, concomitant use of strong CYP450 3A4 inhibitors should be avoided or ruxolitinib therapy interrupted for the duration of strong CYP450 3A4 inhibitor use. For patients with for acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) coadministered strong CYP450 3A4 inhibitors, the ruxolitinib dose should be reduced to 5 mg once a day with concomitant ketoconazole use; however, no dose adjustments are necessary with other potent CYP450 3A4 inhibitors.",

The use of quinolones has been associated with disturbances in blood glucose homeostasis possibly stemming from effects on pancreatic beta cell ATP-sensitive potassium channels that regulate insulin secretion. Both hyperglycaemia and hypoglycemia have been reported, usually in diabetic patients receiving concomitant treatment with an oral hypoglycemic agent (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin. Although hyperglycaemia is significantly more common and infection itself may be an underlying risk factor, hypoglycemia may cause greater morbidity and mortality.",
      "management_text": "Blood glucose should be closely monitored whenever quinolones are prescribed to diabetic patients, especially if they are elderly, have renal impairment, or are severely ill. Patients should be apprised of the increased risk of dysglycemia and be particularly alert to potential signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia such as headache, dizziness, drowsiness, nervousness, confusion, tremor, hunger, weakness, perspiration, palpitation, and tachycardia. If hypoglycemia occurs, patients should initiate appropriate remedial therapy immediately, discontinue the quinolone, and contact their physician. Alternative antibiotics may need to be considered.",
