    "indications": "Fetal echogenic bowel (FEB) is an increased echogenicity of fetal bowel on prenatal ultrasound, and is considered a soft marker of aneuploidy (see\nImage.\nFetal Echogenic Bowel, Ultrasound). FEB is detected on the fetal ultrasound as a hyperechoic and well-defined area in the lower abdomen of the fetus. An associated focus of shadowing may suggest calcification. In the third trimester, this can be a normal finding, representing meconium in the fetus's bowel. However, its identification in the second trimester can be associated with several fetal disorders.\n\nTypically, the echogenicity is compared with the surrounding fetal iliac bone or femur. The echogenicity can also be compared with the fetal lung or liver (see\nImage\n. Fetal Bowel Echogenicity, Ultrasound).\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\nThe finding of FEB can occur as focal, multifocal, or diffuse. There may be single or multiple loops of the bowel\n,\nand it can manifest as solid echogenicity within the lumen or as echogenicity of the walls only.\n[4]\nThe most widely accepted grading system for FEB compares the echogenicity of the fetal bowel with that of the fetal iliac crest. This classification was developed by Slotnick et al and is outlined as follows:\n\nGrade 1: mildly increased; less echogenic compared to the bone\nGrade 2: moderately increased; the same echogenicity as the bone\nGrade 3: pronounced increase; more echogenic than the bone\n[1]\n\nThe grading system is dependent on the subjective assessment of the sonographer and thus can be associated with significant inter- and intra-observer variability. Additionally, the transducer frequency and grading can affect this scoring. With the advancement of technology and the availability of high-frequency transducers, echogenic findings can be exaggerated, leading to an overdiagnosis of FEB.\n[5]\nHence, the recommendation is to use a lower frequency transducer (<5 MHz) at a lower gain setting for optimal results.\n[6]",
    "mechanism": "FEB was initially described as a normal variant and a transient finding during prenatal ultrasound. Most fetuses with an isolated echogenic bowel have normal short- and long-term neonatal outcomes, and the majority show regression of this finding in subsequent scans.\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n\nHowever, echogenic bowel can be associated with chromosomal abnormalities (eg, trisomies 21, 13, 18), cystic fibrosis, congenital infection (eg, TORCH infections), intrauterine growth restriction, gastrointestinal malformations (eg, gastric obstruction, atresia, perforation, meconium ileus), placental insufficiency, intraamniotic bleeding as well as intrauterine and neonatal death.\n[4]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\nThe incidence of these associations varies considerably between studies.\n[13]\n\nAn echogenic bowel is more closely associated with multi-system malformations in fetuses with underlying chromosomal abnormalities. The most common associated systemic involvement in these cases is cardiovascular anomalies (eg, tetralogy of Fallot, coarctation of the aorta, pulmonary artery hypoplasia, tricuspid atresia, cardiomegaly), urinary tract abnormalities (eg, posterior urethral valves, megabladder, bilateral renal dysplasia), craniocerebral anomalies (eg, hydrocephalus), and gastrointestinal malformations.\n[4]\n\nIsolated echogenic bowel has been reported in a few cases with the use of natural iron-rich mineral water during pregnancy.\n[14]\nAdditionally, other studies have noted differences in intestinal microbiota after delivery between healthy fetuses and those with hyperechogenic bowel.\n[15]\nHowever, these associations still require further investigation.",
    "monitoring": "A pragmatic approach should be adopted while investigating pregnancies with the finding of FEB in the second trimester.\n[11]\nPatients should be stratified by FEB grade and the presence of any additional risk factors or findings. Further evaluation should be offered, and an interdisciplinary team, including a genetic counselor, neonatologist, and maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) specialist, should be involved.\n\nComprehensive Ultrasound Evaluation\n\nA detailed ultrasound evaluation should be performed to assess for additional markers or features suggesting chromosome abnormalities (eg, nuchal translucency, cardiac anomalies).\n[6]\nIf there is a normal 4-chamber view and the outflow tracts are visualized as normal, then a fetal echocardiogram is not necessary. However, if these views are abnormal or not obtainable, a fetal echocardiogram should be performed.\n[23]\nAssessment of amniotic fluid is also helpful in detecting maternal-fetal hemorrhage as a cause of the echogenic bowel. Fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could also be considered in cases of FEB associated with bowel dilatation.\n[13]\n\nGenetic Screening Recommendations\n\nThe Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) recommends counseling to estimate the probability of aneuploidy, and, for patients without previous aneuploidy screening, further genetic screening, including cell-free fetal DNA testing or a quadruple screen (if cell-free DNA is unavailable or cost-prohibitive).\n[6]\n[24]\n\nInvasive Diagnostic Testing\n\nAmniocentesis should be offered to all patients, regardless of screening results. In cases with additional findings, including the presence of other soft sonographic markers, major anomalies, or a positive aneuploidy screen, amniocentesis should be offered for definitive diagnosis, and chromosomal microarray can be considered.\n[9]\nAdditionally, if amniocentesis is performed in patients with FEB, amniotic fluid should be sent for fetal karyotype and polymerase chain reaction for congenital infections.\n\nIt is also important to note that echogenic bowel is present as an isolated finding in 4% to 25% of fetuses with aneuploidy, making invasive diagnostic testing reasonable to offer all patients with FEB.\n[6]\n[25]\n[26]\nHowever, SMFM recommends no additional testing for aneuploidy specifically due to an isolated FEB with negative genetic screening results.\n[6]\n\nCystic Fibrosis Screening\n\nCystic fibrosis screening should be performed if it has not already been done as part of routine screening. If both parents are found to be carriers, the patient should be referred for genetic counseling, and diagnostic testing should be offered.\n[6]\n\nSerologic Testing for TORCH Infections\n\nA thorough history should be performed to screen patients for maternal infection with potential causative agents, including cytomegalovirus (CMV), toxoplasmosis, rubella, varicella, herpes, and parvovirus. Routine testing for other potential congenital infections is generally not useful, as the chance of a positive result is low without a history of exposure or other clinical risk factors.\n[6]\n\nAlthough symptomatic maternal infection is uncommon, CMV immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM titers should be ordered, with IgG avidity testing as needed. If results suggest primary CMV infection (eg, positive IgM with low avidity IgG), amniocentesis with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for CMV should be considered to confirm the diagnosis.\n[6]\n[27]",
    "administration": "Diagnosis of echogenic bowel in the second trimester warrants thorough antenatal and postnatal follow-up due to the increased risk of fetal abnormalities. (see\nImage.\nDiagnostic Flowchart of a Fetus With Hyperechogenic Bowel.) The management of FEB depends on the degree of echogenicity and the presence of associated findings. Early identification and appropriate follow-up can help optimize outcomes for both the fetus and the expectant parents.\n\nPrenatal Management\n\nSerial sonographic screening throughout the pregnancy is recommended for reassessment and to monitor for associated conditions, including fetal growth restriction, bowel dilatation, and polyhydramnios, which are themselves associated with adverse outcomes.\n[20]\nSMFM recommends a third-trimester ultrasound for reassessment of FEB and evaluation of fetal growth.\n[6]\n\nA large retrospective cohort study of singleton gestations found that, after excluding cases of echogenic bowel due to aneuploidy and CMV infection, the risk of intrauterine fetal demise was 7.3% in the group with isolated echogenic bowel on mid-trimester ultrasound compared to 0.9% in the nonechogenic bowel group.\n[28]\nIn this study, all fetal deaths in the echogenic bowel group occurred before 30 weeks, at an average gestation of 23.7 weeks. For this reason, the authors suggest that early initiation of serial ultrasounds may be warranted.\n\nPostnatal Management\n\nThe association of gastrointestinal abnormalities with other comorbidities in infants with a diagnosis of FEB highlights the need for these children to be delivered at centers with higher-level neonatal intensive care capabilities and pediatric subspecialists readily available. Pediatric care providers attending the birth should be informed of the antenatal findings of FEB to ensure appropriate postnatal evaluation.\n\nPostnatally, a comprehensive clinical examination must be performed, with particular attention to the abdomen to detect palpable loops of bowel, which could indicate potential obstruction. Passage of meconium and normal feeding patterns should be ensured. Any delay in meconium passage beyond 24 to 48 hours of life or decreased stool output during the first week of life may indicate meconium ileus and should prompt additional consideration for cystic fibrosis while awaiting newborn screening results. Careful monitoring is indicated to prevent complications.\n\nAbdominal x-rays, upper gastrointestinal series, barium, or gastrograffin enema may be required to evaluate for intestinal obstruction.\n[29]\nWhen meconium ileus is suspected, water-soluble contrast enemas can be both diagnostic and therapeutic.\n\nGenetic and infectious disease evaluation should be pursued based on prenatal risk stratification. If it is an isolated finding, and cystic fibrosis and chromosomal conditions have been excluded, there is no need for postnatal follow-up or any further treatment. However, when antenatal testing is incomplete or suggests abnormalities, additional testing for congenital infections may be warranted based on clinical presentation and prenatal findings. For infants requiring surgical intervention or intensive monitoring, a multidisciplinary team approach involving neonatologists, pediatric surgeons, and subspecialists in genetics and pulmonology ensures optimal outcomes.",
    "adverse_effects": "Complications associated with echogenic bowel are related to the underlying pathophysiology. In pregnancies associated with intrauterine growth restriction or elevated alpha-fetoprotein, complications may arise from underlying feto-placental bleeding or congenital anomalies. The association between echogenic bowel and intrauterine fetal death may be related to underlying uteroplacental insufficiency.\n[31]"
