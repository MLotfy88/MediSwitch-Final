    "clinical_significance": "Asthma and COPD are currently among the most prevalent respiratory diseases in the population. A randomized study in Italy, involving 3000 subjects, examined the prevalence of asthma and COPD. The study's results concluded that 1 in 8 adults older than 20 years was affected by either asthma, COPD, or the co-existence of both diseases.\n[19]\n\nTreatment and management begin with understanding the symptoms, confirmatory diagnostic tests, and proper assessment of the severity of the conditions. Beta-2 agonists are integral to frontline management for symptomatic control, preventing exacerbations, and improving quality of life. The National Asthma Education and Protection Program has adopted a step-wise approach to treating bronchial asthma, with SABAs as the first-line treatment for mild acute episodes. Stratification of asthma severity is based on the frequency of daytime and nighttime symptoms, the degree of interference with regular activities, and lung function, as measured by the forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity ratio. A moderate or severe persistent asthma warrants additional therapy in the form of inhaled corticosteroids, followed by LABAs.\n\nAdditional respiratory therapies may be considered if symptoms persist or worsen. Similarly, the Global Initiative for COPD (GOLD) guidelines outline a systematic approach to treating COPD, which involves assessing the severity of symptoms, identifying risk factors for future exacerbations, and evaluating overall lung function. Beta-2 agonists are once again at the forefront of treatment options. In the case of COPD management according to GOLD guidelines, anticholinergics are often added early, along with beta-2 agonists and inhaled corticosteroids.\n[20]\n\nBoth the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) 2020 Focused Updates and the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines emphasize a process that involves assessing adherence, inhaler technique, environmental factors, and comorbidities as initial steps. The NAEPP guidelines recommend treatment intensification if asthma remains uncontrolled, with reassessment occurring in 2 to 6 weeks. Alternatively, de-escalation is recommended if asthma is well-controlled for at least 3 consecutive months. Objective measures, such as spirometry, and self-reported control tools, including the Asthma Control Test (ACT), are utilized. Consider Omalizumab in NAEEP at steps 5 and 6.\n[21]\n\nSMART\n\nFor individuals with moderate to severe persistent asthma who are already taking low- or medium-dose inhaled corticosteroid, the preferred treatment is a single inhaler with ICS-formoterol (referred to as single maintenance and reliever therapy, or “SMART”).\nhttps://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/at-glance-2020-focused-updates-asthma-management-guidelines\nGINA guidelines recommend the term \"MART\" (maintenance and reliever therapy) with ICS-formoterol; in some countries, it is referred to as \"SMART\" (Single-Inhaler Maintenance and Reliever Therapy). The GINA guidelines also use a similar Assess-Adjust-Review cycle, evaluating symptoms (with an ACT score of 20 or greater indicating control), exacerbations, lung function (including forced expiratory volume in 1 second and peak expiratory flow), and biomarkers (such as fractional exhaled nitric oxide exceeding 50 parts per billion [ppb] in adults and adolescents or 35 ppb in children, or blood eosinophils exceeding 300/μL for guiding biologic therapy. GINA guidelines recommend MART (with ICS-formoterol); in some countries, this is referred to as SMART. Consult with an asthma specialist if you require step 4 or higher. Consider consultation at step 3. Specialist consultation is advised in the NAEPP guidelines for step 4 or higher and in the GINA guidelines for steps 4 to 5. Consider biologics in asthma, such as anti-immunoglobulin E, anti-interleukin (IL)-5/IL-5R, anti-IL-4 receptor alpha, and anti-thymic stromal lymphopoietin (Tezepemulab) (see\nTable.\nAsthma Management for Individuals Aged 12 or Older).\n[22]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n\nTable.\nAsthma Management for Individuals Aged 12 or Older\n\nTable\nGINA Preferred Treatment\nDaily medium-high dose ICS-LABA + LAMA, andPRN SABA, Consider Omalizumab\n\nGINA, Global Initiative for Asthma; IG, immunoglobulin; IL, interleukin; ICS, inhaled corticosteroid; LABA, long-acting beta2-agonist; LAMA, long-acting muscarinic antagonist; PRN, as needed; SABA, short-acting beta2-agonist; SMART, single maintenance and reliever therapy"
