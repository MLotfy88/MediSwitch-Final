    "indications": "Contraindications to the administration of the MMR vaccine include:\n\nPrevious severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a dose of MMR or to a vaccine component (i.e., neomycin, gelatin)\nPregnancy or attempting to become pregnant: Women should receive counsel to avoid becoming pregnant 28 days after receiving MMR because of the theoretical risk of congenital rubella syndrome. Pregnant women without immunity to rubella should receive a dose of MMR postpartum.\n[7]\nImmunodeficiency: Individuals with immunodeficiency are at risk for severe complications following immunization with live attenuated virus vaccines (e.g., encephalitis, pneumonitis). Immune deficiencies that are contraindications to MMR include:\nPrimary acquired immunodeficiency (e.g., cellular immunodeficiency, hypogammaglobulinemia, HIV infection)\nMalignant neoplasms such as leukemia and lymphoma that affect the bone marrow or lymphatic system\nImmunosuppressive therapy. MMR should be avoided in patients receiving systemic immunosuppressive therapy just as high-dose corticosteroid therapy.",
    "mechanism": "The rubella vaccine contains live attenuated rubella virus. Live vaccines are whole-cell vaccines, meaning the entire virion is used to create the vaccine. An attenuated vaccine is a vaccine that reduces the virulence of the pathogen while still keeping it viable. This vaccine induces both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. It produces an IgG humoral immune response in individuals, as well as a cell-mediated immune response by rubella-specific activation of CD4+ T-helper and CD 8+ T-lymphocyte cells. Thus, the immune response to a live attenuated rubella vaccine is almost identical to one seen during a natural infection.\n[4]",
    "administration": "In the United States, the rubella vaccine is available only in a combined preparation. Current vaccines include measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) without or with varicella (MMRV). Single antigen (i.e., monovalent) formulations of the rubella vaccine are not available in the United States but are available in some other countries.\n\nMMR combination vaccine: MMR contains live attenuated measles, mumps, and rubella viruses. It is licensed for routine use in individuals >12 months of age and for infants >6 months of age who are traveling internationally.\nMMRV combination vaccine: MMRV is a vaccine that includes live attenuated measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella viruses. It is licensed for use in children 12 months through 12 years.\n\nThe dose of MMR is 0.5 mL. MMR is administered subcutaneously with a 5/8 inch (1.6cm), 23 to 25 gauge needle. The site of administration of individuals >12 months of age is usually the upper outer triceps. Doses administered intramuscularly do not need to be repeated; immunogenicity appears similar in intramuscular and subcutaneous administration.\n[4]\n\nIn the United States, routine immunization with MMR vaccine is recommended for children at 12 to 15 months and 4 through 6 years of age.\n[4]\n[5]\nIn adults, immunity to measles and mumps may be presumed for adults born before 1957.\n[5]\nFormal documentation of immunity to rubella should be established for all women of childbearing age. Non-pregnant women who have no evidence of immunity should be vaccinated. Pregnant women with no evidence of immunity should receive the MMR vaccine as soon as possible in the postpartum period and before discharge from the healthcare facility. Repeat testing for serologic evidence of immunity after that is not required.\n[7]",
    "adverse_effects": "Adverse effects of MMR and MMRV vaccines include fever, mild rash, joint tenderness, lymphadenopathy, and hypersensitivity reactions. The MMR vaccine carries a small risk of febrile seizures. Febrile seizures are rare and are not associated with long-term effects.\n[8]\n[9]",
    "monitoring": "Monitor the patient for both anaphylaxis and syncope for 15 minutes following administration."
