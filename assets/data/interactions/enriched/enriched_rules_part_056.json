The proposed mechanism is inhibition of carbamazepine metabolism via CYP450 3A4. There have been case reports of carbamazepine toxicity associated with the use of both calcium channel blockers (CCBs), which is consistent with their status as moderate CYP450 3A4 inhibitors. The onset is usually within 2 to 4 days after initiation of the CCB, and a reduction in carbamazepine dosage by 50% to 60% or discontinuation of the CCB is often required.", "source": "DDInter", "management_text": "Caution is advised during concomitant use of carbamazepine with diltiazem or verapamil. Serum carbamazepine levels and pharmacologic response should be monitored more closely following the initiation or discontinuation of CCB therapy, and the carbamazepine dosage adjusted as necessary. Some clinicians recommend empirically reducing the carbamazepine dosage by 50% upon initiation of the CCB. Patients should be advised to contact their physician if they experience potential signs and symptoms of carbamazepine toxicity such as headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, confusion, slurred speech, nystagmus, visual disturbances, tremors, and ataxia. If carbamazepine is added to existing diltiazem or verapamil therapy, patients should be monitored for potentially reduced blood pressure and cardiac effects.", "mechanism_text": "Metabolism", "recommendation": "Caution is advised during concomitant use of carbamazepine with diltiazem or verapamil.", "risk_level": "Major", "type": "pharmacodynamic", "metabolism_info": null, "source_url": "https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/56295/", "reference_text": "[1] Spina E, Pisani F, Perucca E \"Clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions with carbamazepine - an update.\" Clin Pharmacokinet 31 (1996): 198-214[2] MacPhee GJ, McInnes GT, Agnew E, Brodie MJ \"Clinically relevant adverse interaction between verapamil and carbamazepine in epileptic patients.\" Proc BR Paedod Soc Dec (1985): p569-70[3] Ahmad S \"Diltiazem-carbamazepine interaction.\" Am Heart J 120 (1990): 1485-6[4] MacPhee GJ, McInnes GT, Thompson GG, Brodie MJ \"Verapamil potentiates carbamazepine neurotoxicity: a clinically important inhibitory interaction.\" Lancet Mar (1986): 700-3[5] Price WA, DiMarzio LR \"Verapamil-carbamazepine neurotoxicity.\" J Clin Psychiatry 49 (1988): 80[6] Bahls FH, Ozuna J, Ritchie DE \"Interactions between calcium channel blockers and the anticonvulsants carbamazepine and phenytoin.\" Neurology 41 (1991): 740-2[7] Patsalos PN, Perucca E \"Clinically important drug interactions in epilepsy: interactions between antiepileptic drugs and other drugs.\" Lancet Neurol 2 (2003): 473-81[8] Maoz E, Grossman E, Thaler M, Rosenthal T \"Carbamazepine neurotoxic reaction after administration of diltiazem.\" Arch Intern Med 152 (1992): 2503-4[9] Eimer M, Carter BL \"Elevated serum carbamazepine concentrations following diltiazem initiation.\" Drug Intell Clin Pharm 21 (1987): 340-2[10] Wijdicks EF, Arendt C, Bazzell MC \"Postoperative ophthalmoplegia and ataxia due to carbamazepine toxicity facilitated by diltiazem.\" J Neuroophthalmol 24 (2004): 95[11] Shaughnessy AF, Mosley MR \"Elevated carbamazepine levels associated with diltiazem use.\" Neurology 42 (1992): 937-8[12] Brodie MJ, MacPhee GJ \"Carbamazepine neurotoxicity precipitated by diltiazem.\" Br Med J 292 (1986): 1170-1[13] Gadde K, Calabrese JR \"Diltiazem effect on carbamazepine levels in manic depression.\" J Clin Psychopharmacol 10 (1990): 378-9[14] Beattie B, Biller J, Mehlhaus B, Murray M \"Verapamil-induced carbamazepine neurotoxicity.\" Eur Neurol 28 (1988): 104-5[15] Bailey DG, Dresser GK \"Natural products and adverse drug interactions.\" Can Med Assoc J 170 (2004): 1531-2[16] Ho PC, Ghose K, Saville D, Wanwimolruk S \"Effect of grapefruit juice on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of verapamil enantiomers in healthy volunteers.\" Eur J Clin Pharmacol 56 (2000): 693-8[17] Pillai U, Muzaffar J, Sandeep S, Yancey A \"Grapefruit juice and verapamil: a toxic cocktail.\" South Med J 102 (2009): 308-9[18] McAllister RG, Jr \"Clinical pharmacology of slow channel blocking agents.\" Prog Cardiovasc Dis 25 (1982): 83-102[19] \"Product Information.
