After titration, tramadol hydrochloride 50 mg to 100 mg can be administered as needed for pain relief every four to six hours, not to exceed 400 mg per day.For the subset of patients for whom rapid onset of analgesic effect is required and for whom the benefits outweigh the risk of discontinuation due to adverse events associated with higher initial doses, tramadol hydrochloride 50 mg to 100 mg can be administered as needed for pain relief every four to six hours, not to exceed 400 mg per day... Studies with tramadol in adults have shown that starting at the lowest possible dose and titrating upwards will result in fewer discontinuations and increased tolerability.In all patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min, it is recommended that the dosing interval of tramadol hydrochloride be increased to 12 hours, with a maximum daily dose of 200 mg.. Since only 7% of an administered dose is removed by hemodialysis, dialysis patients can receive their regular dose on the day of dialysis.The recommended dose for adult patients with cirrhosis is 50 mg every 12 hours.In general, dose selection for an elderly patient over 65 years old should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy..

Either of two methods of administration of labetalol hydrochloride injection may be used: a) repeated intravenous injection, or b) slow continuous infusion... Repeated Intravenous Injection Initially, labetalol hydrochloride injection should be given in a 20 mg dose (which corresponds to 0.25 mg/kg for an 80 kg patient) by slow intravenous injection over a 2 minute period... Immediately before the injection and at 5 minutes and 10 minutes after injection, supine blood pressure should be measured to evaluate response... Additional injections of 40 mg or 80 mg can be given at 10 minute intervals until a desired supine blood pressure is achieved or a total of 300 mg of labetalol HCl has been injected... The maximum effect usually occurs within 5 minutes of each injection... Slow Continuous Infusion Labetalol hydrochloride injection is prepared for continuous intravenous infusion by diluting the vial contents with commonly used intravenous fluids (see below)... Examples of two methods of preparing the infusion solution are: Add 40 mL of labetalol hydrochloride injection to 160 mL of a commonly used intravenous fluid such that the resultant 200 mL of solution contains 200 mg of labetalol HCl, 1 mg/mL... The diluted solution should be administered at a rate of 2 mL/min to deliver 2 mg/min... Alternatively, add 40 mL of labetalol hydrochloride injection to 250 mL of a commonly used intravenous fluid... The resultant solution will contain 200 mg of labetalol HCl, approximately 2 mg/3 mL... The diluted solution should be administered at a rate of 3 mL/min to deliver approximately 2 mg/min... The effective intravenous dose is usually in the range of 50 mg to 200 mg... A total dose of up to 300 mg may be required in some patients... Blood Pressure Monitoring The blood pressure should be monitored during and after completion of the infusion or intravenous injection... The recommended initial dose is 200 mg, followed in 6 to 12 hours by an additional dose of 200 mg or 400 mg, depending on the blood pressure response... Thereafter, inpatient titration with labetalol hydrochloride tablets may proceed as follows: Inpatient Titration Instructions Regimen Daily Dose If needed, the total daily dose may be given in three divided doses... 400 mg 400 mg b.i.d... 800 mg 800 mg b.i.d... 1,600 mg 1,200 mg b.i.d... 2,400 mg The dosage of labetalol hydrochloride tablets used in the hospital may be increased at 1-day intervals to achieve the desired blood pressure reduction... Labetalol hydrochloride injection was tested for compatibility with commonly used intravenous fluids at final concentrations of 1.25 mg to 3.75 mg of labetalol HCl per milliliter of the mixture... Labetalol hydrochloride injection was found to be compatible with and stable (for 24 hours refrigerated or at room temperature) in mixtures with the following solutions: ringer’s injection, USP; lactated ringer’s injection, USP; 5% dextrose and ringer’s injection; 5% lactated ringer’s and 5% dextrose injection; 5% dextrose injection, USP; 0.9% sodium chloride injection, USP; 5% dextrose and 0.2% sodium chloride injection, USP; 2.5% dextrose and 0.45% sodium chloride injection, USP; 5% dextrose and 0.9% sodium chloride injection, USP; and 5% dextrose and 0.33% sodium chloride injection, USP...

Use aseptic technique to carry out the following preparation steps: Prepare for intravitreal injection with the following medical devices for single use (not included): a 5-micron sterile filter needle (19-gauge × 1-1/2 inch) a 1 mL sterile Luer lock syringe (with marking to measure 0.05 mL) a sterile injection needle (30-gauge × 1/2-inch) Before withdrawal, disinfect the outer part of the rubber stopper of the vial.. Place a 5-micron filter needle (19-gauge × 1-1/2 inch) onto a 1 mL Luer lock syringe using aseptic technique.. The filter needle should be discarded after withdrawal of the vial contents and must not be used for the intravitreal injection.. Attach a 30-gauge × 1/2-inch sterile injection needle firmly onto the syringe by screwing it tightly onto the Luer lock.. Hold the syringe at eye level, and carefully push the plunger rod until the plunger tip is aligned with the line that marks 0.05 mL on the syringe.. Figure Figure Figure Figure .6 Administration The intravitreal injection procedure should be carried out under controlled aseptic conditions, which include the use of sterile gloves, a sterile drape, and a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent).. Adequate anesthesia and a broad-spectrum microbicide should be given prior to the injection.. Prior to and 30 minutes following the intravitreal injection, patients should be monitored for elevation in intraocular pressure using tonometry.. Monitoring may also consist of a check for perfusion of the optic nerve head immediately after the injection [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ].. Patients should also be monitored for and instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis without delay following the injection [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ].. If the contralateral eye requires treatment, a new vial should be used and the sterile field, syringe, gloves, drapes, eyelid speculum, filter needle (vial only), and injection needles should be changed before BYOOVIZ is administered to the other eye.",,,,,,Subcutaneous

The total dose of all opioid agonists administered should be considered by the practitioner before ordering opioid analgesics during recovery from anesthesia.. If Fentanyl Citrate Injection is administered with a CNS depressant, become familiar with the properties of each drug, particularly each product’s duration of action.. Dosage Range Chart Total Dosage (expressed as fentanyl base) Moderate Dose —2 mcg/kg to 20 mcg/kg For use in more major surgical procedures, in addition to adequate analgesia, may abolish some of the stress response.. High dose —20 mcg/kg to 50 mcg/kg For open heart surgery and certain more complicated neurosurgical and orthopedic procedures where surgery is more prolonged, and the stress response to surgery would be detrimental to the well-being of the patient.. Maintenance Dose (expressed as fentanyl base) Moderate Dose —2 mcg/kg to 20 mcg/kg 25 to 100 mcg Administer intravenously as needed when movement and/or changes in vital signs indicate surgical stress or lightening of analgesia.. High Dose —20 mcg/kg to 50 mcg/kg Maintenance dosage [ranging from 25 mcg to one half the initial loading dose] as needed based on vital signs indicative of stress and lightening of analgesia.. As a General Anesthetic As a technique to attenuate the responses to surgical stress without the use of additional anesthetic agents, doses of 50 mcg/kg to 100 mcg/kg may be administered with oxygen and a muscle relaxant..

,,,,,8,,"Vasopressin Injection may be administered IM or subcutaneously... Ten units (0.5 mL) of Vasopressin Injection will usually elicit full physiologic response in adult patients; 5 units (0.25 mL) will be adequate in many cases... Vasopressin Injection should be given IM at three or four hour intervals as needed... (For an additional discussion of dosage, consult the sections below.) When determining the dose of Vasopressin Injection for a given case, the following should be kept in mind: It is particularly desirable to give a dose not much larger than is just sufficient to elicit the desired physiologic response... It has been found that one or two glasses of water given at the time Vasopressin Injection is administered reduces such symptoms... Abdominal Distention In the average postoperative adult patient, give 5 units (0.25 mL) initially, increase to 10 units (0.5 mL) at subsequent injections if necessary... It is recommended that Vasopressin Injection be given IM and that injections be repeated at three or four hour intervals as required... Vasopressin Injection used in this manner will frequently prevent, or relieve, postoperative distention... These recommendations apply also to distention complicating pneumonia or other acute toxemias... Abdominal Roentgenography For the average case, two injections of 10 units (0.5 mL) each are suggested... These should be given two hours and one-half hour, respectively, before films are exposed... Many roentgenologists advise giving an enema prior to the first dose of Vasopressin Injection... Diabetes Insipidus Vasopressin Injection may be given by injection or administered intranasally on cotton pledgets, by nasal spray, or by dropper... The dose by injection is 5 to 10 units (0.25 to 0.5 mL) repeated two or three times daily as needed... When Vasopressin Injection is administered intranasally by spray or on pledgets, the dosage and interval between treatments must be determined for each patient.",,,,,,Intramuscular

Nifedipine extended-release tablets should be swallowed whole and should not be bitten or divided.. Titration to doses above 120 mg are not recommended.. Angina patients controlled on nifedipine immediate-release capsules alone or in combination with other antianginal medications may be safely switched to nifedipine extended-release tablets at the nearest equivalent total daily dose (e.g., 30 mg t.i.d.. of nifedipine immediate-release capsules may be changed to 90 mg once daily of nifedipine extended-release tablets).. Experience with doses greater than 90 mg in patients with angina is limited.. Therefore, doses greater than 90 mg should be used with caution and only when clinically warranted.. Care should be taken when dispensing nifedipine extended-release tablets to assure that the extended-release dosage form has been prescribed.. Coadministration with Other Antianginal Drugs Sublingual nitroglycerin may be taken as required for the control of acute manifestations of angina, particularly during nifedipine titration.",,,,,,Oral
