    "indications": "Contraindications to the use of local and regional flaps in the oral cavity include:\n\nInability to adhere to the postoperative care regimen, particularly for interpolated flaps with pedicles at risk of being bitten.\nOngoing use of tobacco or vasoconstrictive drugs (such as nicotine and cocaine), which can impair microvascular perfusion.\nScarring or fibrosis at the planned flap donor site, especially following prior radiation therapy.\nInsufficient tissue for transfer, such as in cases of previous trauma during flap harvest.\nActive infection at the operative site.\nOther medical comorbidities that may impair the patient's ability to tolerate surgery.",
    "clinical_significance": "Oral flap design is critical in diverse surgical contexts, including oncologic reconstruction, cleft palate repair, and wisdom tooth extraction. A well-designed flap in intraoral surgery improves surgical outcomes by enhancing access to operative sites, preserving vital structures, and promoting healing. Additionally, effective flap design minimizes postoperative complications, including infection, dehiscence, and scarring.\n[26]\nMastery of diverse flap techniques enables clinicians to customize their approach to each patient’s unique needs, thereby enhancing surgical outcomes and improving patient satisfaction."
