Salicylates interfere with the action of vitamin K and induce a dose-dependent alteration in hepatic synthesis of coagulation factors VII, IX and X, occasionally increasing the prothrombin time. While these effects are generally slight for most salicylates (except aspirin) at recommended dosages, they may be of clinical significance when combined with the inhibitory effects of anticoagulants on the clotting cascade. Moreover, salicylates are known to cause dose-related gastrointestinal bleeding, which may be complicated by anticoagulant therapy.', NULL, 'Until further data are available, products containing salicylates, especially if given chronically or in high dosages, should preferably be avoided in patients receiving anticoagulants.', NULL, 'Until further data are available, products containing salicylates, especially if given chronically or in high dosages, should preferably be avoided in patients receiving anticoagulants. Close clinical and laboratory observation for bleeding complications is recommended if concurrent therapy is necessary.
