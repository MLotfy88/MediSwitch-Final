Hypoglycemia most frequently occurs during acute consumption of alcohol.  Even modest amounts can lower blood sugar significantly, especially when the alcohol is ingested on an empty stomach or following exercise.  The mechanism involves inhibition of both gluconeogenesis as well as the counter-regulatory response to hypoglycemia.  Episodes of hypoglycemia may last for 8 to 12 hours after ethanol ingestion.  By contrast, chronic alcohol abuse can cause impaired glucose tolerance and hyperglycemia.  Moderate alcohol consumption generally does not affect blood glucose levels in patients with well controlled diabetes.  A disulfiram-like reaction (e.g., flushing, headache, and nausea) to alcohol has been reported frequently with the use of chlorpropamide and very rarely with other sulfonylureas.', 'alcohol', 'Moderate', 'Patients with diabetes should avoid consuming alcohol if their blood glucose is not well controlled, or if they have hypertriglyceridemia, neuropathy, or pancreatitis.
