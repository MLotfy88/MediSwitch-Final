Hepatic reactions have primarily occurred in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (mainly hematological malignancy); however, some reactions (including hepatitis, jaundice) occurred in patients with no other identifiable risk factors.  Hepatic function should be monitored in all patients; a higher frequency of liver enzyme elevations was observed in pediatrics.  Serum transaminase levels and bilirubin should be measured at the start of therapy and monitored at least weekly for the first month of therapy; monitoring frequency can be reduced to monthly during continued use if no clinically significant changes are observed.  If liver function tests increase significantly from baseline, voriconazole should be discontinued unless, after assessing the benefit/risk to the patient, continued use is justified.Voriconazole is primarily metabolized by the liver and has been shown to accumulate significantly in patients with impaired hepatic function.  The manufacturer recommends that the maintenance dose be halved in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment/cirrhosis.  No dosing recommendations are available for patients with severe hepatic impairment/cirrhosis or for patients with chronic hepatitis B or C.  Voriconazole should only be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment if benefit outweighs the potential risk.

Superficial infections and minor acute illnesses such as a mild upper respiratory infection with or without low-grade fever do not contraindicate immunization, particularly if prompt administration of a vaccine is deemed necessary or beneficial.  In fact, when vaccines are administered during the course of a minor illness, the risk of adverse events is not increased, and serum antibody response is not often diminished.  On the other hand, if fever or symptoms suggest a moderate or severe illness, it is usually appropriate to withhold vaccination until the patient has recovered.  In addition to the potential risks already mentioned, evolving signs and symptoms of the illness can sometimes confound the diagnosis of a vaccine reaction if it develops.  In the presence of any infection, the decision to administer or withhold/defer immunization should take into consideration the benefits versus the risks to an individual patient.', '3', '"Product Information.

During clinical trials, the overall rate of ALT (SGPT) elevation >= 3 times the ULN in patients treated with zileuton was 3.2%.  The manufacturer recommends periodic monitoring of hepatic transaminases.  Serum ALT should be evaluated prior to starting treatment, once a month for the first three months, every 2 to 3 months for the remainder of the first year, and periodically thereafter for patients receiving long-term zileuton therapy.  If clinical signs and/or symptoms of liver dysfunction occur or transaminase levels increase to 5 times the ULN, treatment should be stopped, and transaminase levels followed until normal.
