    "clinical_significance": "Breastfeeding provides critical protection against a range of diseases, including cardiovascular conditions, atopic disorders, and infections. Additionally, breast milk supports neurodevelopment and reduces the risk of behavioral and developmental disorders in children.\n[14]\n\nBreast milk harbors a complex and dynamic microbiome that plays a pivotal role in seeding the infant gut microbiota, promoting immune maturation, and reducing allergy risk. Maternal nutrition, health status, stress levels, and environmental exposures profoundly influence breast milk’s composition, underscoring the value of tailored maternal dietary guidance to optimize lactation outcomes.\n[15]\n\nThe rise in breast milk expression and storage, driven by increased maternal workforce participation, necessitates strict hygiene and storage protocols to preserve milk quality and prevent contamination. Stored breast milk remains safe in a refrigerator at 4 °C for up to 5 days and in a freezer at -18 °C for 6 to 12 months, depending on the freezing system. Proper thawing techniques and sterilization of feeding equipment are essential.\n\nContraindications to breastfeeding include the following:\n\nMaternal chemotherapy or recent radioactive therapy\nHuman T-cell lymphotropic virus infection or untreated brucellosis\nUntreated or active tuberculosis\nMaternal substance abuse (alcohol or illicit drugs)\nSuspected or untreated maternal HIV infection (with current guidelines reviewing context)\nAn infant with galactosemia\n\nIn these cases, alternative feeding options should be discussed to ensure infant safety.\n\nPublic health initiatives, including the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative, remain vital to promoting and sustaining breastfeeding globally by providing education, social support, and integration into healthcare systems. By strengthening these initiatives, healthcare systems can secure lasting benefits for maternal and child health across diverse populations."
