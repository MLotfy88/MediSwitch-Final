Hypoglycemia and, less frequently, hyperglycemia have been reported, although the latter may also occur due to infection alone.  Hypoglycemia has usually occurred in patients with diabetes receiving concomitant oral hypoglycemic agents and/or insulin.  Administration of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, norfloxacin, and especially gatifloxacin in patients treated with sulfonylureas or other oral hypoglycemic agents has resulted in severe, refractory hypoglycemia and hypoglycemic coma.  Elderly patients and patients with reduced renal function are particularly susceptible.  Blood glucose should be monitored more closely whenever quinolones are prescribed to patients with diabetes.  Gatifloxacin has been known to cause hypoglycemic episodes generally within the first 3 days of therapy and sometimes even after the first dose, while hyperglycemia usually occurs 4 to 10 days after initiation of therapy.  Patients should be counseled to recognize symptoms of hypoglycemia such as headache, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, tremor, weakness, hunger, excessive perspiration, and palpitations.

The most common culprits include clindamycin and lincomycin.  Antibacterial therapy alters the normal flora of the colon, leading to overgrowth of C difficile, whose toxins A and B contribute to CDAD development.  Morbidity and mortality are increased with hypertoxin-producing strains of C difficile; these infections can be resistant to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy.  CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea after antibacterial use.  Since CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after antibacterial use, careful medical history is necessary.  Therapy with broad-spectrum antibacterials and other agents with significant antibacterial activity should be administered cautiously in patients with history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis; pseudomembranous colitis (generally characterized by severe, persistent diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps, and sometimes associated with the passage of blood and mucus), if it occurs, may be more severe in these patients and may be associated with flares in underlying disease activity.

These serious adverse events can develop at any time, with or without warning symptoms.  Only 1 in 5 patients who develop a serious upper GI side effect on NSAIDs is symptomatic.  NSAIDs should be used with caution in patients with history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding, as these patients had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors.  Caution is also advised if NSAIDs are prescribed to patients with other factors that increase risk of GI bleeding, such as:  prolonged NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), anticoagulants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; alcohol use; smoking; history of gastrointestinal surgery or anastomosis, older age; poor general health status; and advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy.  Particular vigilance is necessary when treating elderly or debilitated patients since most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in these patients.', '3', '"Product Information.
