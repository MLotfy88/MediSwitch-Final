By inhibiting the metabolism of acetylcholine, more of the neurotransmitter may be available to compete at muscarinic receptors, the site of action of anticholinergic agents. Conversely, anticholinergic agents may negate the already small pharmacologic benefits of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in the treatment of dementia. These agents may also adversely affect elderly patients in general. Clinically significant mental status changes associated with anticholinergic agents can range from mild cognitive impairment to delirium, and patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementia are especially sensitive.",

For patients requiring treatment to counteract adverse effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor therapy (e.g., gastrointestinal intolerance, urinary problems), an agent without anticholinergic properties should be used whenever possible. Otherwise, a dosage reduction, slower titration, or even discontinuation of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor should be considered. For patients who are already receiving an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor with anticholinergic agents, every attempt should be made to discontinue the latter or substitute them with less anticholinergic alternatives. Caution is required, however, since anticholinergic withdrawal may occur. Seizures have been reported following abrupt discontinuation of anticholinergics during acetylcholinesterase inhibitor therapy.",

Patients should be closely monitored for excessive sedation and sudden loss of consciousness and have continuous pulse oximetry monitoring. During the brexanolone infusion, monitor for sedative effects every 2 hours during planned, non-sleep periods, and immediately stop the infusion if there are signs or symptoms of excessive sedation. After symptoms resolve, the infusion may be resumed at the same or lower dose as clinically appropriate. If pulse oximetry reveals hypoxia, immediately stop the infusion and do not resume infusion following resolution of the hypoxia. Patients should be cautioned against driving, operating machinery, or engaging in potentially hazardous activities requiring mental alertness and motor coordination until sedative effects of brexanolone and other concomitant medications have dissipated.",
