Vigabatrin can also damage the central retina and decrease visual acuity. The onset of vision loss is unpredictable, occurring within weeks of starting treatment to months or even years later. The risk of vision loss increases with increasing dose and cumulative exposure, although there is no dose or exposure known to be risk-free. It is possible that vision loss can worsen even after discontinuation of vigabatrin.",

These drugs may include amiodarone, deferoxamine, ethambutol, quinine derivatives, tamoxifen, and long-term corticosteroids. Vision testing at baseline (no later than 4 weeks after starting vigabatrin) and at least every 3 months during therapy is required for adults. Vision testing is also required about 3 to 6 months after the discontinuation of vigabatrin therapy. Due to the risk of irreversible vision loss, vigabatrin should be withdrawn from patients who fail to show substantial clinical benefit within 3 months of initiation, or sooner if treatment failure becomes obvious. The patient's response and continued need for vigabatrin should be periodically reassessed. The lowest dosage and shortest duration of treatment consistent with clinical objectives should be employed.",

A nine-month course of daily INH remains the preferred treatment for LTBI in both HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients. Other acceptable options include nine months of twice-weekly INH, or six months of either daily or twice-weekly INH. Twice-weekly therapy must be administered under direct observed therapy (DOT), and the six-month regimens should generally not be used in HIV-infected individuals, those with fibrotic lesions on chest radiographs, and children. Four months of daily RIF may be considered for persons who are contacts of patients with INH-resistant, RIF-susceptible TB. The RIF-PZA regimen should never be offered to patients who are taking concomitant medications associated with liver injury; patients who drink alcohol excessively (even if alcohol use is discontinued during treatment); patients with underlying liver disease; and patients with a history of INH-associated liver injury. RIF-PZA may be considered in carefully selected patients if there is reason to believe they are not likely to complete the preferred six- or nine-month regimens. If RIF-PZA is prescribed, the PZA dosage should be no more than 20 mg/kg/day (up to a maximum of 2 g/day) or 50 mg/kg twice weekly (up to a maximum of 4 g twice weekly), and no more than a two-week supply of the medications should be dispensed at any given time. Patients should be evaluated in person by a healthcare provider at 2, 4, and 6 weeks of treatment for adherence, tolerance and adverse effects, and at 8 weeks to document treatment completion. Patients should also be instructed to discontinue the drugs promptly and seek medical attention if signs and symptoms of hepatic injury develop, including fever, rash, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, right upper quadrant pain, dark urine, and jaundice. Serum transaminases and bilirubin should be measured at baseline and at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks of treatment in patients taking RIF-PZA.

      "effect": "Coadministration with weak or moderate dual inhibitors of CYP450 3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) may increase the plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban, which is a substrate of both the isoenzyme and efflux transporter.",
      "management_text": "In patients with CrCl of 15 to less than 80 mL/min, the use of rivaroxaban with weak or moderate dual inhibitors of CYP450 3A4 and P-gp should only be considered if the potential benefits justify the increased risk of bleeding complications. Patients should be routinely evaluated for signs and symptoms suggesting blood loss such as a drop in hemoglobin and/or hematocrit, hypotension, or fetal distress (in pregnant women). Renal function should also be assessed periodically, and treatment with rivaroxaban discontinued if acute renal failure develops. Due to the lack of clinical data, rivaroxaban is not recommended in patients with CrCl below 30 mL/min when used for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis and in patients with CrCl below 15 mL/min when used for reducing the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.",
