      "management_text": "Because the potential interaction between efavirenz and contraceptive hormones has not been fully characterized, and use of efavirenz has been associated with fetal malformations in animal studies, the manufacturer recommends that women avoid pregnancy during efavirenz treatment and that a barrier form of contraception be used in addition to hormonal contraceptives. Alternative or additional methods of birth control should be used during and for at least 4 weeks after efavirenz therapy. Input from a gynecologist or similar expert on adequate contraception, including emergency contraception, should be sought as needed. Intrauterine systems are unlikely to be significantly affected because of their local action.",

Certain macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, clarithromycin) may increase the plasma concentrations and the risk of adverse effects of estrogens and progestogens.

The risk of hypocalcemia may also be increased, as drug-induced renal tubular damage can lead to renal loss of calcium and other electrolytes such as magnesium. Bisphosphonates alone often cause mild, asymptomatic hypocalcemia via inhibitive effects on bone resorption and possibly chelation of blood calcium.

Theoretical concerns exist regarding the potential for increased risk and severity of renal impairment during coadministration of bisphosphonates with high dosages or chronic use of NSAIDs due to additive or synergistic nephrotoxic effects on the kidney.

The risk of hypocalcemia may also be increased, as drug-induced renal tubular damage can lead to renal loss of calcium and other electrolytes such as magnesium. Bisphosphonates alone often cause mild, asymptomatic hypocalcemia via inhibitive effects on bone resorption and possibly chelation of blood calcium.

Some authorities recommend adjusting vasopressin dosage as needed. Serum electrolytes, especially sodium, as well as BUN and creatinine should be monitored regularly. Patients should be advised to seek medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms of water intoxication or hyponatremia such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, headache, malaise, lethargy, irritability, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, muscle spasm, unsteadiness (which may lead to falls), anuria, and weight gain. Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated; therefore, early treatment is important to help prevent progression to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, and death.",

Because NSAIDs reduce the rate of ulcer healing in the stomach and duodenum, it is also possible that NSAIDs may delay healing and exaggerate the mucosal injury caused by oral bisphosphonates. Theoretical concerns exist regarding the potential for increased risk and severity of renal impairment during coadministration of bisphosphonates with high dosages or chronic use of NSAIDs due to additive or synergistic nephrotoxic effects on the kidney. The use of bisphosphonates has been associated with nephrotoxicity manifested as deterioration of renal function and renal failure. Cases have primarily involved intravenous formulations of the drugs such as pamidronic acid and zoledronic acid, especially when they are administered too rapidly. The risk of hypocalcemia may also be increased, as drug-induced renal tubular damage can lead to renal loss of calcium and other electrolytes such as magnesium. Bisphosphonates alone often cause mild, asymptomatic hypocalcemia via inhibitive effects on bone resorption and possibly chelation of blood calcium. Chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be associated with renal toxicities including elevations in serum creatinine and BUN, tubular necrosis, glomerulitis, renal papillary necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and renal failure.",
