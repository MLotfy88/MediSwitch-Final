    "Background": {
      "text": "Primary amebic meningoencephalitis is a rare central nervous system disease caused by the thermophilic free-living amoeba\nNaegleria fowleri\nThe amoeba lives in freshwater and can enter the brain through the cribriform plate after water containing it enters the nose; the amoeba causes direct tissue damage with hemorrhage and necrosis of brain tissue\n[1]\nExposure can occur from natural water sources (lakes, ponds, puddles) as well as man-made sources (swimming pools)\nCases nearly always result in death - in the USA 141/145 known cases were fatal\n>50% cases in the USA occur in Texas and Florida\n[2]\n[3]",
