    "indications": "Benign eyelid lesions are commonly found during a routine exam by the eye care provider, primary care provider, or dermatologist. The most common benign inflammatory lesions include chalazion and pyogenic granuloma.   Infectious lesions include verruca vulgaris, molluscum contagiosum, and hordeolum. Benign neoplastic lesions include squamous cell papilloma, epidermal inclusion cyst, dermoid/epidermoid cyst, acquired melanocytic nevus, seborrheic keratosis, hidrocystoma, cyst of Zeiss, and xanthelasma.\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n\nMany less common lesions can mimic the more common ones. All benign lesions need to be differentiated from pre-malignant lesions that include actinic keratosis and keratoacanthoma, as well as malignant lesions that include basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, sebaceous carcinoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, metastatic lesions, cutaneous lymphoma, and melanoma.\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n\nA careful history that includes questions regarding predisposing factors, duration, and rate of growth of the lesion, symptoms of tenderness, discharge, or bleeding, combined with careful clinical observation, will determine whether to observe the lesion or refer for a biopsy and histopathological analysis.\n[9]\n\nWhen indicated, treatment consists of excision, curettage, electrocautery, cryosurgery, or different types of laser treatments.\n\nMost benign lesions originate from the epidermis, dermis, or adnexal structures of the skin (meibomian glands or glands of Moll and Zeiss). In several studies, about 80 to 85% of eyelid lesions that required biopsy were benign.\n[10]\n[11]",
    "mechanism": "The etiology of benign eyelid lesions is best differentiated according to the tissue from which the lesion originates.\n[12]\nThe eyelid comprises four to seven layers depending on the zone of the eyelid and lower or upper eyelid. Each of these layers can give rise to benign lesions. The lower eyelid has a zone located at the lid margin and is 5 mm wide, and a distal zone, also 5 mm wide, adjoins the orbital rim. The upper eyelid has a 5 mm zone at the eyelid margin, a middle zone of 5 mm, and a 10 mm distal zone that adjoins the orbital rim and eyebrow. The tissue distribution is as follows:\n\nSkin, subcutaneous tissue, and adnexa (upper and lower lids, all sections of lids)\nOrbicularis muscle (upper and lower lids, all sections of lids)\nPre-aponeurotic orbital fat (upper lid, distal portion)\nPre-capsulopalpebral fascial fat (lower lid, distal portion)\nLevator aponeurosis (upper lid, middle and distal portion)\nCapsulopalpebral fascia (lower eyelid distal portion)\nMüller muscle (upper/margin/distal)\nTarsus with the meibomian glands (upper and lower lids, all sections of lids)\nPalpebral conjunctiva (upper and lower lids, all sections of lids)\n\nAdnexal structures in the eyelid skin include eyelashes, sebaceous glands of Zeis, and sweat glands of Moll. The levator and orbicularis muscles are made up of striated muscle, while Müller's muscle is made up of smooth muscle. The marginal part of the orbicularis muscle is called the muscle of Riolan, and the superficial part of this muscle can be observed as a colored line that separates the meibomian gland orifices from the row of eyelashes. This line is called the gray line and is significant as it demarcates the separation of the anterior and posterior lamellae. Lesions in front of the septum are called preseptal and, as in the case of preseptal cellulitis, are less serious than those posterior to the septum, such as orbital cellulitis.\n\nThe most common causes of benign eyelid lesions are:\n\nInflammation of a blocked gland (e.g., chalazion)\nInfection and inflammation of a gland (e.g., hordeolum)\nLipid accumulation in the dermis (e.g., xanthelasma)\nCyst formation of adnexal or epidermis structures (e.g., epidermal inclusion cyst, cyst of Moll, cyst of Zeiss)\nMelanocyte proliferation in the dermis and epidermis (e.g., nevus)\nThe proliferation of cells in the epidermis (acanthosis) and hyperkeratosis (e.g., seborrheic keratosis, acrochordon/skin tag)\nInfection of the epidermis (usually viral, e.g., verruca vulgaris, molluscum contagiosum)\n[12]\n[4]\n\nSeveral of the phakomatoses are associated with benign eyelid lesions.\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\nThese include:\n\nNeurofibromatosis Type 1 -plexiform neurofibroma\nTuberous sclerosis -angiofibroma\nSturge-Weber Syndrome -port-wine stain",
    "monitoring": "Besides visual observation with a biomicroscope or a dermoscope, other tests that may be done are:\n\nBiopsy and histopathological analysis: the biopsy may be incisional or excisional.\nCT or MRI scans: These tests may be done to determine the size and extent of the lesion.\n[69]\nPhotography: This may be done to follow growth over time in lesions that are not removed.\nHigh-resolution ultrasound: a technique to analyze buried lesions that are deeper in the eyelid.\n[70]",
    "administration": "Skin\n\nEpidermis\n\nSeborrheic keratosis (SK) is best treated with shave excision at the junction of the dermis and epidermis.\n[16]\nDermatosis papulosa nigra (DPN). These lesions are often observed as removal may cause scar formation and dyspigmentation. When treated, snip excision, light curettage or electrodesiccation, and laser treatment are all options that reduce the risk of dyspigmentation. Cryotherapy is not recommended as it increases the risk of hypopigmented scar formation.\n[57]\nInverted follicular keratosis is best treated with biopsy and complete excision. It is likely to recur if the lesion is not completely removed.\nVerruca vulgaris recommended treatment is surgical excision or cryotherapy.\n[58]\nMolluscum contagiosum treatment options include excision, cryotherapy, or curettage. Home treatments such as salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide are not recommended to be used close to the eye. The secondary follicular conjunctivitis resolves after these virus shedding lesions are removed from around the eye.\n[71]\nSquamous papilloma (acrochordon or skin tag) is removed by surgical excision or shave biopsy.\n[18]\nEpidermal inclusion cysts (epidermoid cysts). Excision or marsupialization. Milia, which are small epidermal inclusion cysts, are often surgically removed with a \"deroofing\" technique using a needle to remove the epidermis directly above the cyst.\n[60]\nCutaneous dermoid cyst. Treatment is similar to epidermal inclusion cysts.\n[20]\nKeratoacanthoma is best excised with 4 mm margins due to the association with squamous cell carcinoma. In cosmetically sensitive areas, larger lesions should be removed using  Mohs micrographic surgery.\n[21]\nCutaneous horns need to be removed using a complete excisional biopsy so that malignancy of the underlying cause can be ruled out.\n[22]\n\nMelanocytic: Much research has been done to estimate the risk of malignant transformation of melanocytic skin lesions. Risk is assessed based on the patient history and pathophysiology of the lesion. The risk for scarring and a poor functional or cosmetic outcome is higher on the eyelids than elsewhere on the body. This is why it is recommended to refer to an oculoplastics specialist for evaluation and possible biopsy. If a biopsy is done, the histopathology of the lesion will determine whether additional treatment is needed.\n\nEphelis (freckles) and solar lentigo lesions are not thought to transform into melanoma. However, these lesions are a sign of increased light exposure and, as such, indicate an increased risk of light-induced skin malignancies.\n[23]\nLentigo simplex is not thought to have malignant potential and can be observed or removed with chemical peels, surgical excision, skin laser, or cryotherapy.\n[24]\nSolar lentigo is not thought to have an increased rate of skin malignancy and can be observed or treated with skin lightening agents such as Cysteamine 5% cream as well as skin laser or cryotherapy. These treatments can leave scars.\nNevi\n[61]\n[62]\nLarge congenital nevi (over 20 cm in size) have an estimated 4 to 20% risk of malignant transformation.\n[72]\nSmaller congenital nevi have a much lower risk. Blue nevi, in their pure histopathological form, are benign. However, blue nevus variants that appear similar have transformation potential, such as in blue nevus-like melanoma. Oculodermal melanocytosis requires semi-annual monitoring for glaucoma as well as melanoma of the skin, iris, and choroid.\n[30]\nAcquired\nIn one study of 144 patients with Spitz type nevi, 6 developed melanoma over nine years (0.5% annual incidence).\n[32]\nMelanocytic nevus. Treatment of junctional, intradermal, and compound nevi is not indicated as the transformation rate to melanoma is low. If removed, junctional nevi are less likely to recur as the nevus cells are more superficial than intradermal and compound nevi.\nNon-dysplastic nevi (junctional, intradermal, and compound) have a relatively low risk of transforming melanoma. One study reported a rate of transformation of 1 in 200,000 of any non-dysplastic nevus for men and women under the age of 40 years. However, over 40, the risk of transformation goes up, and by age 80, the risk of any mole converting to melanoma is 1 in 3000 for males and 1 in 11,000 for females.\n[73]\nThe presence of dysplastic nevi is a strong risk for melanoma. In one study, subjects with one dysplastic nevus had a 1.6 increased odds ratio of melanoma, while patients with over four nevi had a 10.5 odds ratio. The risk of a single dysplastic nevus transforming is still quite low and estimated to be about 1 in 40,000 for females and 1 in 30,000 for males.\n[73]\n\nAdnexal Lesions\n\nInternal and external hordeolum is best treated with hot compresses and topical and oral antibiotics such as cephalosporins and sulfonamide/folic acid inhibitor combination drugs. The presence of visible purulent material within the lesion, also called a \"point\" or pustule, significant pain, and eyelid edema and erythema (indicating a concomitant preseptal cellulitis) require the use of an oral antibiotic to avoid further spread and prevent orbital cellulitis. In the case of a recalcitrant hordeolum, a referral within 2 or 3 days for incision and drainage is indicated. External hordeola are often at the base of an eyelash. In this case, epilation of the lash may allow for the draining of the lesion. The practitioner is cautioned against trying to express a hordeolum, especially when a clear point is not visible, as this is extremely painful and may cause preseptal cellulitis.\n[44]\n\nHair Follicles\n\nTrichoepithelioma: different treatments have been reported that include laser treatment, skin transplantation, electrodesiccation, imiquimod, and retinoic acid application.\n[34]\nTrichofolliculoma is recommended to be removed using simple surgical excision.\n[35]\nTrichilemmoma is recommended to be removed using a shave biopsy to provide a better cosmetic outcome.\n[36]\nPilomatrixoma is recommended to be surgically excised with wide surgical margins to avoid recurrence.\n[37]\n\nSweat Glands\n\nFor apocrine and eccrine hidrocystomas, electrocautery, trichloroacetic acid, and excision are preferred over incision-and-draining as removing the cyst wall is necessary to prevent a recurrence. For multiple lesions, CO2 laser and, in one report, botulinum toxin A injection were used.\n[38]\nTrichilemmal cysts are recommended to be completely excised to avoid recurrence.\n[39]\nSyringoma can be removed with a CO2 laser, excision, dermabrasion, trichloroacetic acid, electrocautery, electrodesiccation, and cryotherapy. Since the lesion is deep in the dermis, it often can not be treated completely, and recurrence is common.\n[40]\nPleomorphic adenoma is recommended to be completely excised with a few millimeters of margin to avoid recurrence.\n[41]\nEccrine spiradenoma is recommended to be surgically excised. Multiple lesions can be removed with a CO2 laser.\n[42]\n\nAccessory Lacrimal Glands\n\nComplete excision of pleomorphic adenoma and oncocytoma is recommended.\n[43]\n\nSebaceous Glands\n\nChalazion and internal hordeolum are best treated with hot compresses, lid hygiene, topical and oral antibiotics including azithromycin and doxycycline, and antimicrobial lid wipes containing hypochlorous acid or tea tree oil, steroid injection, and surgical excision. In one study, 85 % of patients received non-surgical treatment; incision and curettage were performed in 15% of eyes and intralesional steroid injection in 0.55% of eyes.\n[74]\nCyst of Zeis, sebaceous cyst, sebaceous gland hyperplasia, and sebaceous gland adenoma are all best excised and sent for histopathological analysis.\n[46]\n\nStromal Lesions\n\nXanthelasma: Surgical excision, CO2 laser, topical 100% trichloroacetic acid. The recurrence rate is high. One study determined a 40% and 60% recurrence rate after primary and secondary excision, respectively.\n[65]\n[75]\n\nVascular Lesions\n\nUp to 90% of pyogenic granulomas can be treated with topical corticosteroids. Topical beta-blockers such as timolol have also been shown to be effective in causing regression of the lesion. If the lesion is small enough to be observed, it may spontaneously regress. For those lesions that do not respond to topical steroids, a referral for complete excision is recommended.\n[76]\n[77]\nTo determine the extent of the capillary hemangioma, imaging in the form of ultrasound, CT, or MRI imaging when deeper lesions are suspected should be done. Capillary hemangiomas can be associated with Kasabach-Merrit syndrome, Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, PHACES syndrome, and Maffucci syndrome. A referral for evaluation for these syndromes is indicated. When a capillary hemangioma causes mechanical ptosis, treatment for amblyopia may need to be implemented. Testing for exophthalmos and strabismus should be performed as well. Since, in 80% of cases, the hemangioma will have regressed by age 8, management is often to avoid sequelae such as amblyopia, strabismus, optic nerve compression, and tissue necrosis as well as cosmetic considerations. First-line treatment is systemic beta-blockers or oral and intralesional corticosteroids. Surgical treatment can include CO2 and other laser photocoagulation treatments for more superficial lesions. Radiation and surgical excision are options as well.\n[51]\nTreatments for angiofibromas of the face include superficial ablation and vascular ablation with lasers, as well as shave excision and electrodesiccation. Sirolimus ointment has been used successfully in reducing the severity of facial angiofibromas. If angiofibromas are associated with tuberous sclerosis, referrals to the appropriate specialists will be necessary.\n[13]\nNevus flammeus (port-wine stain) in the case of Sturge Weber syndrome (SWS), the patient needs to be evaluated for ocular sequelae associated with SWS that includes glaucoma and choroidal hemangiomas. Eye findings to look for are Haab striae, corneal edema, buphthalmos, tomato-catsup fundus, skin-, conjunctival-, episcleral- and choroidal-hemangiomas, heterochromia irides, retinal vascular tortuosity, and arteriovenous communications. In young patients, this may require an evaluation under anesthesia. Medical and surgical glaucoma treatment may need to be implemented, and pulsed dye laser photocoagulation for cosmesis, as this has shown a marked increase in quality of life for affected individuals.\n[52]\n\nNeurogenic\n\nPatients with plexiform neurofibroma of the eyelid will need eye exams at least every six months until the age of eight to evaluate for rapid worsening of the eyelid ptosis, glaucoma, strabismus, proptosis, amblyopia, optic nerve edema or atrophy, visual field loss, afferent pupillary defect, and exposure keratopathy. Amblyopia is the most significant concern for vision loss in these patients. The frequency of evaluations after the age of 9 can be less than every six months, depending on the severity of the disease. Communication with other specialists in the medical team is essential. The timing of surgical intervention depends on the level of ophthalmic complications.\n[53]\nSolitary neurofibroma management includes testing for neurofibromatosis and observation or surgical excision if medically indicated.\n[54]\nSchwannoma surgical management consists of complete excision with a clear margin to allow histopathological analysis and prevent a recurrence. Recurrence of incompletely excised lesions has been more aggressive. Since vestibular schwannoma is associated with neurofibromatosis type 2, a referral for testing for neurofibromatosis may also be made.\n[55]\n\nLipomatous\n\nLipomas can be observed or surgically removed when needed. Care should be taken to remove the whole capsule to reduce the chance of recurrence.\n[56]",
    "adverse_effects": "Complications can occur when a cancerous lesion is misdiagnosed as benign and observed without biopsy and histopathological analysis.  Another complication that can occur is if the excision of the lesion causes a functional or cosmetic deficit in the ocular structures.  Finally, poor outcomes can result from a lack of understanding by the practitioner that a benign lesion heralds the presence of a systemic disease affecting other parts of the body.\n[86]"
