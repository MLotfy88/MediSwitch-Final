    "clinical_significance": "Cataract surgery is a safe and highly effective treatment. As many as 95% of patients will have a best-corrected visual acuity of 20/40 after surgery.\n[65]\nPatients report improvement in mental and emotional well-being, improved social interactions, as well as improvements in reading, watching television, and recognizing people.\n[66]\nPatients who undergo cataract surgery are also less likely to be involved in traffic crashes.\n[67]\nThere is an overall mortality benefit to patients who undergo cataract surgery.\n[68]\nFinally, there is an economic benefit to cataract surgery with an ROI of 833% due to high costs associated with poor vision such as depression, injury, hospital admissions, necessary caretakers, and decreased employment.\n[69]"
