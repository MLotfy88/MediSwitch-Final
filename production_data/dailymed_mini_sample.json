      "dosage_and_administration": "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Fluorouracil is recommended for administration either as an intravenous bolus or as an intravenous infusion. (2.2) See Full Prescribing Information for dose individualization (2.2) and dose modifications due to adverse reactions (2.7) See Full Prescribing Information for recommended doses of Fluorouracil for adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum (2.3) and for recommended doses of Fluorouracil as a component of a chemotherapy regimen for adenocarcinoma of the breast (2.4), gastric adenocarcinoma (2.5), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (2.6) Pharmacy Bulk Package: Prepare doses for more than one patient in a Pharmacy Admixture Service under appropriate conditions for cytotoxic drugs. Do not inject entire contents of vial directly into patients. Use within 4 hours of puncture (2.8, 2.9) 2.1 Evaluation and Testing for DPD Deficiency Before Initiating Fluorouracil Prior to initiating fluorouracil, test patients for genetic variants of the DPYD gene unless immediate treatment is necessary. An FDA-authorized test for the detection of the DPYD gene to identify patients at risk of serious adverse reactions with fluorouracil is not currently available. Currently available tests used to identify DPYD variants may vary in accuracy and design (e.g., which DPYD variant(s) they identify). Avoid use of fluorouracil in patients known to have certain homozygous or compound heterozygous DPYD variants that result in complete DPD deficiency. No fluorouracil dose has been proven safe for patients with complete DPD deficiency. For patients with partial DPD deficiency, individualize the dosage and modify based on tolerability and intent of treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 2.2 General Dosage Information Fluorouracil is recommended for administration either as an intravenous bolus or as an intravenous infusion. Do not inject the entire contents of the vial directly into patients. Individualize the dose and dosing schedule of Fluorouracil based on tumor type, the specific regimen administered, disease state, response to treatment, and patient risk factors. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for Adenocarcinoma of the Colon and Rectum The recommended dose of Fluorouracil, administered in an infusional regimen in combination with leucovorin alone, or in combination with leucovorin and oxaliplatin or irinotecan, is 400 mg/m2 by intravenous bolus on Day 1, followed by 2400 mg/m2 to 3000 mg/m2 intravenously as a continuous infusion over 46 hours every two weeks. The recommended dose of Fluorouracil, if administered in a bolus dosing regimen in combination with leucovorin, is 500 mg/m2 by intravenous bolus on Days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36 in 8-week cycles. 2.4 Recommended Dosage for Adenocarcinoma of the Breast The recommended dose of Fluorouracil, administered as a component of a cyclophosphamide-based multidrug regimen, is 500 mg/m2 or 600 mg/m2 intravenously on Days 1 and 8 every 28 days for 6 cycles. 2.5 Recommended Dosage for Gastric Adenocarcinoma The recommended dose of Fluorouracil, administered as a component of a platinum-containing multidrug chemotherapy regimen, is 200 mg/m2 to 1000 mg/m2 intravenously as a continuous infusion over 24 hours. The frequency of dosing in each cycle and the length of each cycle will depend on the dose of Fluorouracil and the specific regimen administered. 2.6 Recommended Dosage for Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma The recommended dose of Fluorouracil, administered as an infusional regimen in combination with leucovorin or as a component of a multidrug chemotherapy regimen that includes leucovorin, is 400 mg/m2 intravenous bolus on Day 1, followed by 2400 mg/m2 intravenously as a continuous infusion over 46 hours every two weeks. 2.7 Dose Modifications Withhold Fluorouracil for any of the following: Development of angina, myocardial infarction/ischemia, arrhythmia, or heart failure in patients with no history of coronary artery disease or myocardial dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Hyperammonemic encephalopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Acute cerebellar syndrome, confusion, disorientation, ataxia, or visual disturbances [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Grade 2 or 3 palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (hand-foot syndrome) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Grade 3 or 4 mucositis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] Grade 4 myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Upon resolution or improvement to Grade 1 diarrhea, mucositis, myelosuppression, or palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, resume Fluorouracil administration at a reduced dose. There is no recommended dose for resumption of Fluorouracil administration following development of any of the following adverse reactions: Cardiac toxicity Hyperammonemic encephalopathy Acute cerebellar syndrome, confusion, disorientation, ataxia, or visual disturbances 2.8 Preparation for Administration Fluorouracil is supplied in a pharmacy bulk package consisting of a vial. The pharmacy bulk package can be used to prepare doses for more than one patient. It is not supplied with a sterile transfer device, which is required for dispensing when multiple doses will be prepared from the single vial. The 50 mL vial is only intended for preparation in a Pharmacy Admixture Service under appropriate conditions for cytotoxic drugs [see References (15)]. Store vial at room temperature. Using aseptic conditions, penetrate the container closure once with a suitable sterile transfer device or dispensing set that allows measured distribution of the contents. Record the date and time the vial was opened on the vial label. Discard the pharmacy bulk package 4 hours after penetration of the container closure. Withdraw the calculated dose for an individual patient into a sterile syringe. Inspect the solution in syringe for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration or further dilution. Discard syringe if the solution is discolored or contains particulate matter. 2.9 Administration Do not administer in the same intravenous line concomitantly with other medicinal products. For bolus administration, store undiluted Fluorouracil in the syringe for up to 4 hours at room temperature (25°C). Administer Fluorouracil as an intravenous bolus through an established intravenous line. Store diluted solutions of Fluorouracil for up to 4 hours at room temperature (25°C) prior to administration to the patient. For intravenous infusion regimens, administer through a central venous line using an infusion pump.",

      "pregnancy": "8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D Risk Summary There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with Fluorouracil in pregnant women. Based on its mechanism of action, Fluorouracil can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Administration of Fluorouracil to rats and mice during selected periods of organogenesis, at doses lower than a human dose of 12 mg/kg, caused embryolethality and teratogenicity. Malformations included cleft palate and skeletal defects. In monkeys, maternal doses of Fluorouracil higher than an approximate human dose of 12 mg/kg resulted in abortion. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. Animal Data Malformations including cleft palate, skeletal defects and deformed appendages (paws and tails) were observed when Fluorouracil was administered by intraperitoneal injection to mice at doses at or above 10 mg/kg (approximately 0.06 times a human dose of 12 mg/kg on a mg/m2 basis) for 4 days during the period of organogenesis. Similar results were observed in hamsters administered Fluorouracil intramuscularly at doses lower than those administered in commonly used clinical treatment regimens. In rats, administration of Fluorouracil by intraperitoneal injection at doses greater than 15 mg/kg (approximately 0.2 times a human dose of 12 mg/kg on a mg/m2 basis) for a single day during organogenesis resulted in delays in growth and malformations including micro-anophthalmos. In monkeys, administration of Fluorouracil during organogenesis at doses approximately equal to a human dose of 12 mg/kg on a mg/m2 basis resulted in abortion; at a 50% lower dose, resorptions and decreased fetal body weights were reported.",

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hematologic: pancytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Gastrointestinal: gastrointestinal ulceration, nausea, vomiting Allergic Reactions: anaphylaxis and generalized allergic reactions Neurologic: nystagmus, headache Dermatologic: dry skin; fissuring; photosensitivity, as manifested by erythema or increased pigmentation of the skin; vein pigmentation Ophthalmic: lacrimal duct stenosis, visual changes, lacrimation, photophobia Psychiatric: euphoria Miscellaneous: thrombophlebitis, epistaxis, nail changes (including loss of nails)",
      "drug_interactions": "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Anticoagulants and CYP 2C9 Substrates Elevated coagulation times have been reported in patients taking Fluorouracil concomitantly with warfarin. While pharmacokinetic data are not available to assess the effect of Fluorouracil administration on warfarin pharmacokinetics, the elevation of coagulation times that occurs with the Fluorouracil prodrug capecitabine is accompanied by an increase in warfarin concentrations. Thus, the interaction may be due to inhibition of cytochrome P450 2C9 by Fluorouracil or its metabolites.",

      "indications": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Neomycin and Polymyxin B Sulfates Solution for Irrigation is indicated for short-term use (up to 10 days) as a continuous irrigant or rinse in the urinary bladder of abacteriuric patients to help prevent bacteriuria and gram-negative rod septicemia associated with the use of indwelling catheters. Since organisms gain entrance to the bladder by way of, through, and around the catheter, significant bacteriuria is induced by bacterial multiplication in the bladder urine, in the mucoid film often present between catheter and urethra, and in other sites. Urinary tract infection may result from the repeated presence in the urine of large numbers of pathogenic bacteria. The use of closed systems with indwelling catheters has been shown to reduce the risk of infection. A three-way closed catheter system with constant neomycin-polymyxin B bladder rinse is indicated to prevent the development of infection while using indwelling catheters. If uropathogens are isolated, they should be identified and tested for susceptibility so that appropriate antimicrobial therapy for systemic use can be initiated.",
      "dosage_and_administration": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION This preparation is specifically designed for use with “three-way catheters or with other catheter systems permitting continuous irrigation of the urinary bladder. The usual irrigation dose is one 1-mL ampul a day for up to 10 days. Using strict aseptic techniques, the contents of 1-mL ampul of Neomycin and Polymyxin B Sulfates Solution for Irrigation should be added to a 1,000-mL container of isotonic saline solution. This container should then be connected to the inflow lumen of the “three-way” catheter which has been inserted with full aseptic precautions; use of a sterile lubricant is recommended during insertion of the catheter. The outflow lumen should be connected, via a sterile disposable plastic tube, to a disposable plastic collection bag. Stringent procedures, such as taping the inflow and outflow junction at the catheter, should be observed when necessary to insure the junctional integrity of the system. For most patients, the inflow rate of the 1,000-mL saline solution of neomycin and polymyxin B should be adjusted to a slow drip to deliver about 1,000 mL every 24 hours. If the patient’s urine output exceeds 2 liters per day, it is recommended that the inflow rate be adjusted to deliver 2,000 mL of the solution in a 24-hour period. It is important that the rinse of the bladder be continuous; the inflow or rinse solution should not be interrupted for more than a few minutes. Preparation of the irrigation solution should be performed with strict aseptic techniques. The prepared solution should be stored at 4°C, and should be used within 48 hours following preparation to reduce the risk of contamination with resistant microorganisms.",
      "pediatric_use": "Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.",
      "pregnancy": "Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category D. See WARNINGS section.",
      "contraindications": "CONTRAINDICATIONS Hypersensitivity to neomycin, the polymyxins, or any ingredient in the solution is a contraindication to its use. A history of hypersensitivity or serious toxic reaction to an aminoglycoside may also contraindicate the use of any other aminoglycoside because of the known cross-sensitivity of patients to drugs of this class.",
      "warnings_and_precautions": "WARNINGS PROPHYLACTIC BLADDER CARE WITH NEOMYCIN AND POLYMYXIN B SULFATES SOLUTION FOR IRRIGATION SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN WHERE THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF SYSTEMIC ABSORPTION. NEOMYCIN AND POLYMYXIN B SULFATES SOLUTION SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR IRRIGATION OTHER THAN FOR THE URINARY BLADDER. Systemic absorption after topical application of neomycin to open wounds, burns, and granulating surfaces is significant and serum concentrations comparable to and often higher than those attained following oral and parenteral therapy have been reported. Absorption of neomycin from the denuded bladder surface has been reported. However, the likelihood of toxicity following topical irrigation of the intact urinary bladder with Neomycin and Polymyxin B Sulfates Solution for Irrigation is low since no appreciable amounts of these antibiotics enter the systemic circulation by this route if irrigation does not exceed 10 days. Neomycin and Polymyxin B Sulfates Solution for Irrigation is intended for continuous prophylactic irrigation of the lumen of the intact urinary bladder of patients with indwelling catheters. Patients should be under constant supervision by a physician. Irrigation should be avoided in patients with defects in the bladder mucosa or bladder wall, such as vesical rupture, or in association with operative procedures on the bladder wall, because of the risk of toxicity due to systemic absorption following diffusion into absorptive tissues and spaces. When absorbed, neomycin and polymyxin B are nephrotoxic antibiotics, and the nephrotoxic potentials are additive. In addition, both antibiotics, when absorbed, are neurotoxins: neomycin can destroy fibers of the acoustic nerve causing permanent bilateral deafness; neomycin and polymyxin B are additive in their neuromuscular blocking effects, not only in terms of potency and duration, but also in terms of characteristics of the blocks produced. Aminoglycosides, when absorbed, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycoside antibiotics cross the placenta and there have been several reports of total, irreversible, bilateral, congenital deafness in children whose mothers received streptomycin during pregnancy. Although serious side effects have not been reported in the treatment of pregnant women with other aminoglycosides, the potential for harm exists. If Neomycin and Polymyxin B Sulfates Solution for Irrigation is used during pregnancy, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus (see PRECAUTIONS).",
      "adverse_reactions": "ADVERSE REACTIONS Neomycin occasionally causes skin sensitization when applied topically; however, topical application to mucus membranes rarely results in local or systemic hypersensitivity reactions. Irritation of the urinary bladder mucosa has been reported. Signs of ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity have been reported following parenteral use of drugs and following the oral and topical use of neomycin (see WARNINGS). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact XGen Pharmaceuticals DJB, Inc. at 1-866-390-4411 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.",

      "dosage_and_administration": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended starting dose is 5 mg once a day. Depending on the patient's response, the dosage can be decreased to 2.5 mg or increased to 10 mg once a day. These adjustments should occur generally at intervals of not less than 2 weeks. The recommended dosage range is 2.5–10 mg once daily. In clinical trials, doses above 10 mg daily showed an increased blood pressure response but a large increase in the rate of peripheral edema and other vasodilatory adverse events (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Modification of the recommended dosage is usually not required in patients with renal impairment. Felodipine should regularly be taken either without food or with a light meal (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism). Felodipine should be swallowed whole and not crushed or chewed. Geriatric Use—Patients over 65 years of age are likely to develop higher plasma concentrations of felodipine (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range (2.5 mg daily). Elderly patients should have their blood pressure closely monitored during any dosage adjustment. Patients with Impaired Liver Function—Patients with impaired liver function may have elevated plasma concentrations of felodipine and may respond to lower doses of Felodipine; therefore, patients should have their blood pressure monitored closely during dosage adjustment of Felodipine (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).",

      "adverse_reactions": "ADVERSE REACTIONS In controlled studies in the United States and overseas, approximately 3000 patients were treated with felodipine as either the extended-release or the immediate-release formulation. The most common clinical adverse events reported with Felodipine administered as monotherapy at the recommended dosage range of 2.5 mg to 10 mg once a day were peripheral edema and headache. Peripheral edema was generally mild, but it was age and dose related and resulted in discontinuation of therapy in about 3% of the enrolled patients. Discontinuation of therapy due to any clinical adverse event occurred in about 6% of the patients receiving Felodipine, principally for peripheral edema, headache, or flushing. Adverse events that occurred with an incidence of 1.5% or greater at any of the recommended doses of 2.5 mg to 10 mg once a day (Felodipine, N = 861; Placebo, N = 334), without regard to causality, are compared to placebo and are listed by dose in the table below. These events are reported from controlled clinical trials with patients who were randomized to a fixed dose of Felodipine or titrated from an initial dose of 2.5 mg or 5 mg once a day. A dose of 20 mg once a day has been evaluated in some clinical studies. Although the antihypertensive effect of Felodipine is increased at 20 mg once a day, there is a disproportionate increase in adverse events, especially those associated with vasodilatory effects (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Percent of Patients with Adverse Events in Controlled Trials* of Felodipine (N = 861) as Monotherapy without Regard to Causality (Incidence of discontinuations shown in parentheses) * Patients in titration studies may have been exposed to more than one dose level of Felodipine.

These events are listed in order of decreasing severity within each category, and the relationship of these events to administration of Felodipine is uncertain: Body as a Whole: Chest pain, facial edema, flu-like illness; Cardiovascular: Myocardial infarction, hypotension, syncope, angina pectoris, arrhythmia, tachycardia, premature beats; Digestive: Abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, dry mouth, flatulence, acid regurgitation; Endocrine : Gynecomastia; Hematologic : Anemia; Metabolic : ALT (SGPT) increased; Musculoskeletal : Arthralgia, back pain, leg pain, foot pain, muscle cramps, myalgia, arm pain, knee pain, hip pain; Nervous/Psychiatric : Insomnia, depression, anxiety disorders, irritability, nervousness, somnolence, decreased libido; Respiratory : Dyspnea, pharyngitis, bronchitis, influenza, sinusitis, epistaxis, respiratory infection; Skin : Angioedema, contusion, erythema, urticaria, leukocytoclastic vasculitis; Special Senses : Visual disturbances; Urogenital : Impotence, urinary frequency, urinary urgency, dysuria, polyuria. Gingival Hyperplasia : Gingival hyperplasia, usually mild, occurred in < 0.5% of patients in controlled studies. This condition may be avoided or may regress with improved dental hygiene. (See PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients. ) Clinical Laboratory Test Findings Serum Electrolytes — No significant effects on serum electrolytes were observed during short- and long-term therapy (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Renal/Endocrine Effects ). Serum Glucose — No significant effects on fasting serum glucose were observed in patients treated with Felodipine in the U.S. controlled study. Liver Enzymes —1 of 2 episodes of elevated serum transaminases decreased once drug was discontinued in clinical studies; no follow-up was available for the other patient.",

Once nightly, place one drop of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution, 0.03% on the disposable sterile applicator supplied with the package and apply evenly along the skin of the upper eyelid margin at the base of the eyelashes. The upper lid margin in the area of lash growth should feel lightly moist without runoff. Blot any excess solution runoff outside the upper eyelid margin with a tissue or other absorbent cloth. Dispose of the applicator after one use. Repeat for the opposite eyelid margin using a new sterile applicator. Do not reuse applicators and do not use any other brush/applicator to apply bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03%. Do not apply to the lower eyelash line [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4 ] and Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Additional applications of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% will not increase the growth of eyelashes. Upon discontinuation of treatment, eyelash growth is expected to return to its pre-treatment level.

      "pregnancy": "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% administration in pregnant women. There is no increase in the risk of major birth defects or miscarriages based on bimatoprost postmarketing experience. In embryofetal development studies, administration of bimatoprost to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis resulted in abortion and early delivery at oral doses at least 33 times (mice) or 94 times (rats) the human exposure following topical ophthalmic administration of bimatoprost 0.03% to the cornea or conjunctival sac bilaterally once daily, based on the area under the curve (AUC). These adverse effects were not observed at 2.6 times (mice) and 47 times (rats) the human exposure following topical ophthalmic administration of bimatoprost 0.03% to the cornea or conjunctival sac bilaterally once daily, based on AUC. In pre/postnatal development studies, administration of bimatoprost to pregnant rats from organogenesis to the end of lactation resulted in reduced gestation length and fetal body weight, and increased fetal and pup mortality at oral doses at least 41 times the human systemic exposure following topical ophthalmic administration of bimatoprost 0.03% to the cornea or conjunctival sac bilaterally once daily, based on AUC. No adverse effects were observed in rat offspring at exposures estimated at 14 times the human exposure following topical ophthalmic administration of bimatoprost 0.03% to the cornea or conjunctival sac bilaterally once daily, based on AUC. Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% should be administered during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Data Animal Data In an embryofetal development rat study, abortion was observed in pregnant rats administered bimatoprost orally during organogenesis at 0.6 mg/kg/day (94 times the human systemic exposure following topical ophthalmic administration of bimatoprost 0.03% to the cornea or conjunctival sac bilaterally once daily , based on AUC). The No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for abortion was 0.3 mg/kg/day (estimated at 47 times the human systemic exposure following topical ophthalmic administration of bimatoprost 0.03% to the cornea or conjunctival sac bilaterally once daily based on AUC). No abnormalities were observed in rat fetuses at doses up to 0.6 mg/kg/day. In an embryofetal development mouse study, abortion and early delivery were observed in pregnant mice administered bimatoprost orally during organogenesis at doses greater than or equal to 0.3 mg/kg/day (33 times the human systemic exposure following topical ophthalmic administration of bimatoprost 0.03% to the cornea or conjunctival sac bilaterally once daily , based on AUC). The NOAEL for abortion and early delivery was 0.1 mg/kg/day (2.6 times the human systemic exposure following topical ophthalmic administration of bimatoprost 0.03% to the cornea or conjunctival sac bilaterally once daily, based on AUC) . No abnormalities were observed in mouse fetuses at doses up to 0.6 mg/kg/day (72 times the human systemic exposure following topical ophthalmic administration of bimatoprost 0.03% to the cornea or conjunctival sac bilaterally once daily, based on AUC). In a pre/postnatal development study, treatment of pregnant rats with bimatoprost orally from gestation day 7 to lactation day 20 resulted in reduced gestation length, increased late resorptions, fetal deaths, and postnatal pup mortality, and reduced pup body weight at doses greater than or equal to 0.3 mg/kg/day. These effects were observed at exposures at least 41 times the human systemic exposure following topical ophthalmic administration of bimatoprost 0.03% to the cornea or conjunctival sac bilaterally once daily, based on AUC). The NOAEL for postnatal development and mating performance of the offspring was 0.1 mg/kg/day (estimated at 14 times the human systemic exposure following topical ophthalmic administration of bimatoprost 0.03% to the cornea or conjunctival sac bilaterally once daily, based on AUC).",

The following information is based on clinical trial results from a multicenter, double-masked, randomized, vehicle-controlled, parallel study including 278 adult patients for four months of treatment. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were eye pruritus, conjunctival hyperemia, skin hyperpigmentation, ocular irritation, dry eye symptoms, and periorbital erythema. These reactions occurred in less than 4% of patients. Additional adverse reactions seen in clinical trials experience include foreign body sensation, hair growth abnormal, and iris hyperpigmentation. Additional adverse reactions reported with bimatoprost ophthalmic solution (LUMIGAN®) for the reduction of intraocular pressure include, ocular dryness, visual disturbance, ocular burning, eye pain, blepharitis, cataract, superficial punctate keratitis, eye discharge, tearing, photophobia, allergic conjunctivitis, asthenopia, conjunctival edema, iritis, infections (primarily colds and upper respiratory tract infections), headaches, and asthenia. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03%.

Doses greater than 40 mg daily have not been studied in this population. The safety and effectiveness of pravastatin have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 10 years of age with HeFH or in pediatric patients with other types of hyperlipidemia (other than HeFH).",
      "geriatric_use": "8.5 Geriatric Use In clinical studies, 4,797 (36.4%) pravastatin-treated patients were aged 65 and older and 110 (0.8%) were aged 75 and older. No significant differences in efficacy or safety were observed between geriatric patients and younger patients. Mean pravastatin AUCs are 25% to 50% higher in elderly subjects than in healthy young subjects, but mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax), and half-life (t½) values are similar in both age groups and substantial accumulation of pravastatin would not be expected in the elderly [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Advanced age (≥65 years) is a risk factor for pravastatin-associated myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, recognizing the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of myopathy. Monitor geriatric patients receiving pravastatin for the increased risk of myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].",
      "pregnancy": "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Discontinue pravastatin when pregnancy is recognized. Alternatively, consider the ongoing therapeutic needs of the individual patient. Pravastatin decreases synthesis of cholesterol and possibly other biologically active substances derived from cholesterol; therefore, pravastatin may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant patients based on the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. In addition, treatment of hyperlipidemia is not generally necessary during pregnancy. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and the discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of long-term therapy of primary hyperlipidemia for most patients. Available data from case series and prospective and retrospective observational cohort studies over decades of use with statins in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major congenital malformations. Published data from prospective and retrospective observational cohort studies with pravastatin use in pregnant women are insufficient to determine if there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage (see Data). In animal reproduction studies, no evidence of fetal malformations was seen in pregnant rats or rabbits orally administered pravastatin during the period of organogenesis at doses that resulted in 10 times and 120 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 80 mg/day, based on body surface area (mg/m2). An imbalance in some fetal skeletal variations, increased offspring mortality, and developmental delays occurred when pregnant rats were exposed to 10 times to 12 times the MRHD during organogenesis to parturition (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data A Medicaid cohort linkage study of 1,152 statin-exposed pregnant women compared to 886,996 controls did not find a significant teratogenic effect from maternal use of statins in the first trimester of pregnancy, after adjusting for potential cofounders – including maternal age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and alcohol and tobacco use – using propensity score-based methods. The relative risk of congenital malformations between the group with statin use and the group with no statin use in the first trimester was 1.07 (95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.37) after controlling for confounders, particularly pre-existing diabetes mellitus. There were also no statistically significant increases in any of the organ-specific malformations assessed after accounting for cofounders. In the majority of pregnancies, statin treatment was initiated prior to pregnancy and was discontinued at some point in the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Study limitations include reliance on physician coding to define the presence of a malformation, lack of control for certain confounders such as body mass index, use of prescription dispensing as verification for the use of a statin, and lack of information on non-live births. Animal Data Embryofetal and neonatal mortality was observed in rats given pravastatin during the period of organogenesis or during organogenesis continuing through weaning. In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 4 mg/kg/day, 20 mg/kg/day, 100 mg/kg/day, 500 mg/kg/day, and 1,000 mg/kg/day from gestation days 7 through 17 (organogenesis) increased mortality of offspring and increased cervical rib skeletal anomalies were observed at ≥100 mg/kg/day systemic exposure, 10 times the human exposure at 80 mg/day MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m2). In other studies, no teratogenic effects were observed when pravastatin was dosed orally during organogenesis in rabbits (gestation days 6 through 18) up to 50 mg/kg/day or in rats (gestation days 7 through 17) up to 1,000 mg/kg/day. Exposures were 10 times (rabbit) or 120 times (rat) the human exposure at 80 mg/day MRHD based on body surface area (mg/m2). In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 10 mg/kg/day, 100 mg/kg/day, and 1,000 mg/kg/day from gestation day 17 through lactation day 21 (weaning), developmental delays were observed at ≥100 mg/kg/day systemic exposure, corresponding to 12 times the human exposure at 80 mg/day MRHD, based on body surface area (mg/m2). In pregnant rats, pravastatin crosses the placenta and is found in fetal tissue at 30% of the maternal plasma levels following administration of a single dose of 20 mg/day orally on gestation day 18, which corresponds to exposure 2 times the MRHD of 80 mg daily based on body surface area (mg/m2).",

In pravastatin placebo-controlled clinical trials, 21,483 patients (age range 24 to 75 years, 10.3% women, 52.3% White, 0.8% Black, 0.5% Hispanic, 0.1% Asian, 0.1% Other, 46.1% not recorded) had a median treatment duration of 261 weeks. Adverse reactions (regardless of causality) were pooled from 7 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study [WOS]; Cholesterol and Recurrent Events study [CARE]; Long-term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischemic Disease study [LIPID]; Pravastatin Limitation of Atherosclerosis in the Coronary Arteries study [PLAC I]; Pravastatin, Lipids and Atherosclerosis in the Carotids study [PLAC II]; Regression Growth Evaluation Statin Study [REGRESS]; and Kuopio Atherosclerosis Prevention Study [KAPS]) involving a total of 10,764 patients treated with pravastatin 40 mg and 10,719 patients treated with placebo. Patients were exposed to pravastatin for a mean of 4 to 5.1 years in WOS, CARE, and LIPID and 1.9 to 2.9 years in PLAC I, PLAC II, KAPS, and REGRESS. Adverse reactions (regardless of causality) occurring in ≥5% of patients treated with pravastatin in these studies are identified in Table 2: Table 2: Adverse Reactions in ≥ 5% of Patients Treated with Pravastatin 40 mg and at an Incidence Greater than Placebo in Long-Term Placebo-Controlled Trials Placebo (N=10,719) % of patients Pravastatin (N=10,764) % of patients Musculoskeletal Pain 24.4 24.9 Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 20.2 21.2 Musculoskeletal Traumatism 9.6 10.2 Chest Pain 9.8 10.0 Influenza 9.0 9.2 Fatigue 7.8 8.4 Cough 7.4 8.2 Dizziness 6.6 7.3 Rash (including dermatitis) 7.1 7.2 Sinus Abnormality 6.7 7.0 Muscle Cramp 4.6 5.1 Adverse Reactions (regardless of causality) No new adverse reactions were identified in a study of pediatric patients with HeFH. Laboratory Abnormalities Increases in ALT, AST values and CK have been observed. Transient, asymptomatic eosinophilia has been reported. Eosinophil counts usually returned to normal despite continued therapy. Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia have been reported with statins. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of pravastatin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Musculoskeletal: myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, tendon disorder, polymyositis, immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use. Nervous System: dysfunction of certain cranial nerves (including alteration of taste, impairment of extraocular movement, facial paresis), peripheral nerve palsy. Rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with statin use. Cognitive impairment was generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks). There have been rare reports of new-onset or exacerbation of myasthenia gravis, including ocular myasthenia, and reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. Hypersensitivity: anaphylaxis, angioedema, lupus erythematosus-like syndrome, polymyalgia rheumatica, dermatomyositis, vasculitis, purpura, hemolytic anemia, positive ANA, ESR increase, arthritis, arthralgia, asthenia, photosensitivity, chills, malaise, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome). Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, constipation, pancreatitis, hepatitis (including chronic active hepatitis), cholestatic jaundice, fatty change in liver, cirrhosis, fulminant hepatic necrosis, hepatoma, fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure. Dermatologic: a variety of skin changes (e.g., nodules, discoloration, dryness of mucous membranes, changes to hair/nails), lichen planus. Renal: urinary abnormality (including dysuria, frequency, nocturia). Respiratory: dyspnea, interstitial lung disease. Psychiatric: nightmare. Reproductive: gynecomastia. Laboratory Abnormalities: liver function test abnormalities, thyroid function abnormalities.",
      "drug_interactions": "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See full prescribing information for details regarding concomitant use of pravastatin sodium tablets with other drugs that increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. (2.5, 7.1) Bile Acid Sequestrants: in patients taking a bile acid sequestrant, administer pravastatin sodium tablets at least 1 hour before or at least 4 hours after the bile acid sequestrant (7.2) 7.1 Drug Interactions that Increase the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis with Pravastatin Pravastatin is a substrate of the transport protein OATP1B1. Pravastatin plasma levels can be significantly increased with concomitant administration of inhibitors of OATP1B1. Table 3 includes a list of drugs that increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when used concomitantly with pravastatin and instructions for preventing or managing them [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Table 3: Drug Interactions that Increase the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis with Pravastatin Gemfibrozil Clinical Impact: There is an increased risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis when pravastatin is administered with gemfibrozil Intervention: Avoid concomitant use of gemfibrozil with pravastatin . Cyclosporine Clinical Impact: The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant use of cyclosporine with pravastatin. Intervention: Initiate with a dosage of pravastatin sodium 10 mg once daily. Do not exceed pravastatin 20 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Select Macrolide Antibiotics Clinical Impact: The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased by concomitant use of clarithromycin or erythromycin with pravastatin. Other macrolides (e.g., azithromycin) have the potential to increase pravastatin exposures and increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when used concomintantly. Intervention: For patients taking erythromycin or clarithromycin, do not exceed 40 mg pravastatin once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Niacin Clinical Impact: Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been observed with concomitant use of niacin with pravastatin. Intervention: Consider if the benefit of using niacin concomitantly with pravastatin outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. If concomitant use is decided, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy, particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug. Fibrates (other than Gemfibrozil) Clinical Impact: Fibrates may cause myopathy when given alone. The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant use of fibrates with pravastatin. Intervention: Consider if the benefit of using fibrates concomitantly with pravastatin outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. If concomitant use is decided, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy, particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug. Colchicine Clinical Impact: Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with concomitant use of colchicine with pravastatin. Intervention: Consider if the benefit of using colchicine concomitantly with pravastatin outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. If concomitant use is decided, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy, particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug. 7.2 Drug Interactions that Decrease the Efficacy of Pravastatin Table 4 presents drug interactions that may decrease the efficacy of pravastatin and instructions for preventing or managing them. Table 4: Drug Interactions that Decrease the Efficacy of Pravastatin Bile Acid Sequestrants Clinical Impact: Concomitant cholestyramine or colestipol administration decreased the mean exposure of pravastatin approximately 51% and 47%, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Intervention: In patients taking a bile acid sequestrant, administer pravastatin at least 1 hour before or at least 4 hours after the bile acid sequestrant [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].",
