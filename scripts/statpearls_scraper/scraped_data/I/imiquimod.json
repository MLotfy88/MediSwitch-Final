    "indications": "Available data are limited regarding the use of imiquimod during pregnancy, and therefore, its use in this setting is not currently recommended.\n[20]",
    "mechanism": "Imiquimod is an immune response modifier of the imidazoquinolinamines drug class that induces the production of various cytokines, such as Interferon-alpha, Interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and interleukin-8.\n[10]\n[11]\nImiquimod activates the innate and adaptive immune responses via binding to Toll-like receptor 7 and activation of nuclear factor kappa-B with the resultant cytokine release and recruitment of plasmacytoid predendritic cells to the site of medication application with subsequent release of Interferon-alpha and a Th1 response.\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\nIn addition to its anti-viral activity, imiquimod induces apoptosis of skin cancer cells and has demonstrated anti-tumoral activity.\n[16]",
    "administration": "To treat external anogenital warts, topical 5% imiquimod cream is applied to clean, dry skin overnight by rubbing in the medication completely and leaving the cream for approximately 6 to 10 hours on alternating days three times per week a maximum of 16 weeks or until warts have cleared.\n[1]\nWhen using 3.75% imiquimod cream to treat external anogenital warts, the patient should apply a thin layer overnight once every day for a maximum of 8 weeks or until warts have cleared.\n[2]\nThe patient washes the cream off after overnight application.\n[1]\n[2]\n\nFor the treatment of actinic keratoses, 5% imiquimod cream should be applied topically to either the face or scalp to a maximum area of 25 cm^2 once a day, twice weekly over 16 weeks.\n[17]\nTo treat the entire face or the balding scalp over a shorter treatment period, 2.5% or 3.75% imiquimod cream can be applied as a thin layer once per day overnight for approximately 8 hours for two weeks, followed by a treatment-free period for two weeks, and then a subsequent two weeks of treatment.\n[4]\nThe patient should wash the cream off after overnight application.\n[4]\n\nFor the treatment of superficial basal cell carcinoma, rub 5% imiquimod cream into a biopsy-confirmed superficial basal cell carcinoma with a maximum lesion diameter of 2 cm and the region 1 cm around the lesion.\n[5]\nThe cream should be applied for a minimum of 8 hours overnight, followed by removal by washing with soap and water.\n[5]\nThe cream should be applied once per day for 5 days per week over six weeks.\n[5]",
    "adverse_effects": "Reported side effects of 5% imiquimod cream, when used to treat external anogenital warts, are often mild and include erythema, edema, erosion, excoriation, induration, or scabbing.\n[1]\nPatients have also reported pain, pruritus, and irritation at the site of application or local cutaneous edema or erythema with the use of topical 2.5% or 3.75% imiquimod creams to treat external anogenital warts.\n[2]\nWhen used to treat actinic keratoses, reported local adverse effects of imiquimod cream include erythema, flaking, scabbing, edema, weeping, and erosion, but the presence of these reactions correlates with improved lesion clearance.\n[18]\nLess common systemic adverse effects when 5% imiquimod cream was applied to the scalp, face, or upper extremity to treat actinic keratosis included flu-like symptoms, headache, fever, anorexia, somnolence, fatigue, nausea, myalgia, and diarrhea.\n[19]\nWhen applied for the treatment of superficial basal cell carcinoma, adverse effects include pruritus, burning, and pain at the application site and uncommon upper respiratory tract infections, back pain, or sinusitis.\n[5]\nApplication site reactions usually do not result in treatment withdrawal due to their frequent lack of severity.\n[6]",
    "monitoring": "During treatment, the response requires assessment to check for clearance of external anogenital warts or actinic keratoses and decreased size or resolution of superficial basal cell carcinoma. Additionally, application site reactions and local cutaneous adverse effects may occur, and patients should have ongoing monitoring for these developments, which may also be indicative of treatment response.\n[18]\n[5]\n[2]\nPercutaneous absorption of topical imiquimod and serum concentrations of the medication are limited.\n[21]\n[19]\nSystemic adverse effects are typically mild and include fatigue, flu-like symptoms, and headache. Imiquimod is excreted in the urine.\n[19]",
    "toxicity": "While most side effects of topical imiquimod use are mild, there are reports of severe local or systemic adverse effects associated with topical imiquimod use, in which case the prescriber may need to halt treatment.\n[22]\n[23]\nFor patients with autoimmune conditions, the application of imiquimod over large areas of the body should prompt caution, given the potential for a systemic immune response.\n[22]"
