If a combination oral contraceptive pill is used, a regimen containing at least 50 mcg of ethinyl estradiol per day or equivalent should be considered.  Although breakthrough bleeding is not necessarily indicative of low ethinyl estradiol serum levels or increased risk of ovulation, some clinicians suggest that women who experience breakthrough bleeding during enzyme-inducing therapy may be prescribed an increased dose of ethinyl estradiol above 50 mcg daily by combining more than one formulation of contraceptive pill if necessary.  For emergency contraception in patients who have used an hepatic enzyme inducer in the past 4 weeks, a non-hormonal emergency contraceptive (e.g., copper intrauterine device) is considered preferable.  If this is not possible, some authorities recommend that the usual dose of levonorgestrel (1.5 mg) should be doubled to 3 mg and taken as a single dose as soon as possible (within 72 hours of unprotected sexual intercourse).  However, there are no data on efficacy, compliance, or side effects of this regimen.  For women with the etonogestrel subdermal implant, the addition of a barrier method is recommended during concomitant use and for 28 days after discontinuation of hepatic enzyme inducing drugs.
