The use of quinolones has been associated with disturbances in blood glucose homeostasis possibly stemming from effects on pancreatic beta cell ATP-sensitive potassium channels that regulate insulin secretion. Both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia have been reported, usually in diabetic patients receiving concomitant treatment with an oral hypoglycemic agent or insulin. Although hyperglycemia is significantly more common and infection itself may be an underlying risk factor, hypoglycemia may cause greater morbidity and mortality.', 'DDInter', 1767317477, 'Blood glucose should be closely monitored whenever quinolones are prescribed to diabetic patients, especially if they are elderly, have renal impairment, or are severely ill. Due to the risk of profound and potentially life-threatening hypoglycemia, particular caution is advised during concomitant use of insulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylureas, meglitinides). Patients should also be apprised of the increased risk of hypoglycemia and be alert to potential signs and symptoms such as headache, dizziness, drowsiness, nervousness, confusion, tremor, hunger, weakness, perspiration, palpitation, and tachycardia. If hypoglycemia occurs, patients should initiate appropriate remedial therapy immediately, discontinue the quinolone, and contact their physician. Alternative antibiotics may need to be considered.', 'Antagonism', 'Blood glucose should be closely monitored whenever quinolones are prescribed to diabetic patients, especially if they are elderly, have renal impairment, or are severely ill.', NULL, NULL, 'Major', 'pharmacodynamic');
