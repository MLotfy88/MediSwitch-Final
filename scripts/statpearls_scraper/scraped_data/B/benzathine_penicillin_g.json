    "clinical_significance": "Antepartum care is the health care provided during pregnancy to optimize outcomes for both the mother and the fetus. The primary objectives are to identify high-risk pregnancies and to monitor the health of the mother and the development of the fetus. Prenatal visits are an intricate balance of maternal and fetal management aimed to prevent significant maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality and provide support throughout the prenatal course. Close follow-up with timely review of new complaints or issues, physical exam findings, sonography abnormalities, and laboratory results facilitate the necessary interventions. These may include escalation of care to more frequent antepartum care visits, close follow-up by maternal-fetal medicine specialists, antepartum fetal surveillance, and potential early delivery depending on the gestational age, clinical picture, and potential improvement of outcomes.\n\nWhile many interventions can be performed with relative ease, multiple obstacles may prevent the implementation of these recommendations. Clinicians may have racial biases, insufficient knowledge of updated guidelines, or miss diagnoses that lead to suboptimal care. Furthermore, social determinants of health may frequently prevent patient compliance with visits or management recommendations, including reduced access to prenatal facilities, unreliable transportation, communication barriers, childcare needs, and medication costs, resulting in poor patient outcomes. Because of this, clinicians should strive to remain current on all obstetric guidelines, provide supportive, unbiased care, and identify any barriers to antepartum interventions to optimize maternal-fetal outcomes.\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]"
