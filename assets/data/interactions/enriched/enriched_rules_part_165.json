The potential risk for serotonin syndrome should be considered even when administering serotonergic agents sequentially, as some agents may demonstrate a prolonged elimination half-life. For example, a 5-week washout period is typically recommended following use of fluoxetine before administering another serotonergic agent. If serotonin syndrome develops or is suspected during the course of therapy, all serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately and supportive care rendered as necessary. Moderately ill patients may also benefit from the administration of a serotonin antagonist (e.g., cyproheptadine, chlorpromazine). Severe cases should be managed under consultation with a toxicologist and may require sedation, neuromuscular paralysis, intubation, and mechanical ventilation in addition to the other measures.", "mechanism_text": "Synergism", "recommendation": "Caution is advised if 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are prescribed in combination with SSRIs.", "risk_level": "Major", "type": "pharmacodynamic", "metabolism_info": null, "source_url": "https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/165487/", "reference_text": "[1] Cerner Multum, Inc. \"Australian Product Information.\" O 0[2] Koriech OM \"Fluoxetine treatment comprises the antiemetic efficacy of ondansetron in cancer patients.\" Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol) 7 (1995): 371-2[3] \"Product Information.
