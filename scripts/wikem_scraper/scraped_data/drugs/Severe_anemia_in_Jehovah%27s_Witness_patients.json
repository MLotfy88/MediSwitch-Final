      "text": "Jehovah's Witness paients traditionally refuse allogenic blood and whole blood products.\nThis includes:  RBCs, plasma, platelets, white cells)\n[1]\nHOWEVER, they are able to choose to accept BLOOD COMPONENT FRACTIONS (includes recombinant factor VII, PCC), though this decision may still vary per individual.\n[2]\nThis can make cases of life threatening bleeding difficult to address.  However, multiple options exist to temporize and treat bleeding which are acceptable to Jehovah's Witness patients. These include:\n[3]\nErythropoesis stimulation\nIron supplementation\nOxygen carriers\nWhole blood conservation\nIt is important to note that individual Jehovah's Witnesses may not strictly adhere to this doctrine; up to 49% of Jehovah's Witness patients in one study would be willing to accept blood products in certain circumstances.\n[4]\nIt's worth carefully discussing the risks/benefits with the patient (without visitors present), especially if the need is truly critical.",
