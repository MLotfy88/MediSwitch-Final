    "indications": "Patients administering chemotherapeutic drugs should also avoid CoQ10, as there is insufficient data on its interaction with these drugs. As CoQ10 lowers fasting blood glucose in some patients, it should be used cautiously in those with diabetes and patients prone to hypoglycemic episodes. CoQ10 is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity reactions to CoQ10 or excipients. Some supplements contain silicon dioxide, which may be responsible for hypersensitivity reactions.\n[51]",
    "mechanism": "CoQ10, also called ubiquinone, is a fat-soluble, vitamin-like molecule found naturally in every cellular membrane in our bodies and a normal part of our diet, though endogenously synthesized. CoQ10 is crucial for efficiently transferring electrons within the mitochondrial oxidative respiratory chain and producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP).\n[29]\nCoQ10 can potentially increase the production of vital antioxidants, such as superoxide dismutase, an enzyme that effectively mitigates vascular oxidative stress in individuals with hypertension.\n[30]\nIn addition, CoQ10 lowers lipid peroxidation levels by diminishing pro-oxidative compounds.\n[31]\nFurthermore, CoQ10 can improve blood flow and safeguard blood vessels by preserving nitric oxide.\n\nSupplements offer CoQ10 in either the oxidized form (ubiquinone) or the reduced form (ubiquinol). The bioavailability of a given CoQ10 supplement depends on the lipid carrier it is immersed in and any added preservatives.\n[32]\n\nPharmacokinetics\n\nAbsorption:\nCoQ10 is a hydrophobic (lipophilic) molecule with a high molecular weight; absorption of dietary CoQ10 is slow but is improved in the presence of fatty meals. Solubilized CoQ10 formulations provide improved bioavailability, with peak plasma concentrations typically ranging from 5.80 to 8.10 hours, depending on the specific formulation. Various formulations such as liposome, nanocapsule, and nanoemulsion are being explored to improve bioavailability. A second plasma peak may also be observed due to the enterohepatic recycling and redistribution from the liver to the circulation.\n\nDistribution:\nCoQ10 is primarily absorbed from the small intestine, and CoQ10 is incorporated into chylomicrons and is redistributed via the bloodstream, primarily within VLDL, LDL, and HDL. Preclinical studies indicate that CoQ10 in large doses is taken up by all tissues, including heart and brain mitochondria; consequently, a beneficial effect is observed in cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. The highest levels of CoQ10 in human tissues exist in the heart, liver, kidneys, and muscles (high energy requirements).\n[33]\n\nMetabolism:\nCoQ10 is metabolized in all tissues, and the resulting metabolites are phosphorylated in the cells and transported through the plasma. CoQ10 is reduced to ubiquinol during or after absorption in the small intestine, and the reduced form represents approximately 95% of the circulating CoQ10 in humans.\n\nElimination:\nThe primary route of elimination is biliary and fecal. A small fraction is eliminated in the urine.\n[34]",
    "administration": "Available Dosage Forms and Strengths\n\nMost human studies on CoQ10 have focused on its oral supplementation. Available in various forms, such as tablets, capsules, soft gels, and liquid formulations, these oral supplements range from 30 to 600 mg per unit and are easily accessible over the counter. While topical over-the-counter preparations are also available, research on this mode of administration is limited. For instance, one study explored the effectiveness of a topical treatment for age-related skin oxidative damage.\n[35]\n\nMeat has the highest amount of CoQ10, followed by dairy, eggs, and plant-based food sources (oils and legumes). CoQ10 extracted from living tissues is more expensive than produced in the laboratory by fermentation, yielding consistent quality and cheaper supplements.\n[36]\n\nSupplementation with 50 mg twice daily has decreased statin-related mild-to-moderate myalgias, resulting in an increased ability to perform daily activities.\n[21]\nThe meta-analysis of RCTs indicated that CoQ10 supplementation (100 to 600 mg/d) decreased the Statin-Associated Muscle Symptoms (SAMS).\n[37]\n\nSupplementation with 300 mg daily for 24 weeks in men with Peyronie disease may decrease penile plaque size, reduce penile curvature, and improve erectile function.\n[19]\n\nA double-blind, randomized controlled trial showed 300 mg daily to be safe and superior to a placebo for migraine prevention.\n[38]\nAnother randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult women showed that 400 mg of supplementation decreased migraine frequency, severity, and duration.\n[2]\nOne study showed that only 100 mg daily reduced the severity of headaches and the number of headaches per month in migraine sufferers.\n[39]\n\nThe meta-analysis of RCTs indicated that CoQ10 supplementation (100 to 600 mg/d) decreased the SAMS.\n\nIn patients with primary CoQ10 deficiency, early treatment with high-dose supplementation (ranging from 5 to 50 mg/kg/day) can limit disease progression.\n[40]\nA recent study of CoQ10 supplementation (20 mg/kg) demonstrated promising results in patients with primary CoQ10 deficiency with nephrotic syndrome and SNHL.\n[6]\n[41]\n\nSpecific Patient Populations\n\nHepatic impairment:\nCoQ10 supplementation reduces systemic inflammation and biochemical parameters in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, as mentioned in pharmacokinetics, CoQ10 is excreted in bile. Hence, the use is not advised in patients with biliary obstruction.\n[34]\n\nRenal impairment:\nAccording to a recent article on Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO 2022), CoQ10 supplementation may benefit patients with nephrotic syndrome due to primary CoQ10 deficiency. However, studies of CoQ10 in patients with renal impairment are lacking; CoQ10 supplements should be avoided in patients with renal impairment and used only for the indications mentioned in KDIGO guidelines.\n[42]\n\nPregnancy considerations:\nAccording to the manufacturer, CoQ10 is not advised during pregnancy. However, a recent meta-analysis demonstrated that supplementation with CoQ10 may benefit clinical pregnancy rates (CPR) in assisted reproductive technologies (ART).\n[43]\n\nBreastfeeding considerations:\nAccording to the manufacturer, CoQ10 is not advised during breastfeeding. Ubiquinonene is endogenously synthesized and is a standard component of human milk. Concentration CoQ10 is slightly low in the breast milk of mothers with preterm infants. CoQ10 has no specific lactation-related uses; safety data is lacking during lactation. Therefore, use is usually not recommended.\n[44]\n\nOlder patients:\nNo specific dosing recommendations for older or pediatric patients are available.",
    "adverse_effects": "The common adverse effects of CoQ10 are listed below.\n\nCoQ10 is present naturally in the human body. CoQ10 supplements are generally well-tolerated with only minor and infrequent adverse effects, including stomach upset, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n[44]\n[45]\n\nDosages of 100 mg/d or higher have been associated with mild insomnia in some individuals.\n[46]\n\nLiver enzyme elevation is seen in some patients taking 300 mg or more daily, but no liver toxicity is reported. Caution is required in bile duct obstruction.\n[46]\n\nSupplementation is well tolerated, up to 1200 mg/d.\n[5]\n\nOther rare adverse effects have included dizziness, photophobia, irritability, headache, heartburn, increased involuntary movements, and fatigue.\n[44]\n[45]\n[47]\n\nThe FDA does not strictly regulate dietary supplements such as CoQ10, nor are manufacturers required to prove their safety and purity before and after market release. However, several independent agencies test supplements for purity, composition, and strength and issue certifications to manufacturers that meet testing criteria. However, these agencies do not test every batch they manufacture nor guarantee therapeutic value. Manufacturers who have received approval will advertise on their product packaging.\n\nDrug-Drug Interactions\n\nCoQ10 is chemically similar to vitamin K, and some reports are available in the literature for potential warfarin and CoQ10 interaction. There are chances of warfarin treatment failure when patients are taking CoQ10 supplements with warfarin therapy. This interaction is reversible.\n[48]\n[49]\n[50]",
    "monitoring": "Many studies have monitored blood levels of CoQ10 to assess the efficacy of supplementation. Average plasma concentrations appear to be about 0.34 to 1.65 µg/mL.\n[5]\nA toxic blood CoQ10 level has not been determined, mostly because CoQ10 toxicity is absent at the highest oral supplementation levels.\n[5]\n[52]\n\nPeriodic urinalysis (for proteinuria) and renal function tests, neurologic evaluation, ophthalmologic evaluation, and audiometry are required for primary CoQ10 deficiency.\n[6]\n[40]\n[53]",
    "toxicity": "CoQ10 is safe as a dietary supplement. Toxicity is unlikely up to a daily intake of 1200 mg/d, although typical dosages have been 100 to 200 mg/d.\n[52]\nIn preclinical studies, ubiquinol's No-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level (NOAEL) is 300 to 600 mg/kg (Sprague Dawley rats).\n\nThe human supplementation dose of CoQ10 is generally 100 to 300 mg/d. Assuming the human dose is 300 mg/day (5 mg/kg body weight), the safety factor is 60 to -120 times. The study indicated that chronic use of ubiquinol as a dietary supplement in humans is safe.\n[54]"
