      "text": "Decisions over suitability of a donor typically are left to established organizations that differ for each hospital\nGeneral contraindications\nAny kind of cancer (EXCEPT skin cancers other than melanoma, certain primary brain tumors). Essentially this means only cancers with very low risk of metastasis are acceptable\nAny kind of systemic infection or communicable incurable disease\nActive Fungal disease (Cryptoccous, Aspergillus, Histoplasma, Coccidioides, Candidemia, invasive yeast)\nActive Bacterial infection (Tb, sepsis)\nViral infections (HIV, HTLV, rabies, reactive HbsAg, West nile, SARS, enterovirus, HSV, VZV, EBC etc)\nThe general goals with organ donation are organ preservation by maintaining: 1) Physiologic levels of neuro mediated hormones, 2) Blood pressure, 3) Obtaining Screening labs\nPan-hypopituitary state\nDiabetes insipidus\nClinical: DI typically presents with UOP >5cc/kg/hr. Urine Spec Grav: < 1.005, serum Na > 145 or serum osmolality > 305mg/dL\nTreatment: Frequent Na monitoring. Bolus vasopressin 0.5U IV then drip with goal of 0.5U/h. Titrate to UOP 1-2ml/kg/h\nHypothyroidism\n- 20 mcg T4 IV bolus, then T4 at 10 mcg/hr, which may cause hyperkalemia so administer 10 U regular insulin with 1 amp 50% dextrose before IV bolus\nHypoinsulinemia - Insulin drip, titrate to maintain glucose 80-110 with q1 hr checks\nHypocortisol,\nadrenal insufficiency\n- treatment - 15 mg/kg IV bolus QD empirically\nHypotension\nPlace arterial line with goal SBP > 90, MAP > 60\nIf goals are not met. a continuous cardiac index monitor (Vigileo or PICCO) may be indicated. Goals are CI > 2.5 and UOP > 1 ml/kg/hr\nConsider starting inotropes, to include\ndobutamine\nor\nmilrinone\nIf MAP < 60 despite adequate CI, start peripheral pressor (\nphenylephrine\nor\nnorepinepherine\n)\nPlace central line with CVP goals > 5 mmHg\nMaintain fluids at 1.5-2 ml/kg/hr. Choice of fluids include NS for Na < 155, 1/2-NS for Na 156-165, D5W if Na > 165\nScreening labs\nHIV 1/2, HTLV 1 and 2, RPR, Toxoplasma IgG, CMV IgG, EBV IgG, VZV IgG, HSV 1 and 2, Hepatitis A/B/C\nLFTs, amylase, lipase, CBC, coagulation profile\nSpecial Considerations\nHeart often experiences stunning myocardium secondary to neurogenic sympathetic surge. Often will lower EF with some myocyte necrosis and\ntroponin\nleak. Order q6hr serial cardiac enzymes, then repeat echo. Very often heart will recover after initial stunning period",
