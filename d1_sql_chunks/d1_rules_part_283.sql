Specifically, inhibition of catecholamine-mediated glycogenolysis and glucose mobilization in association with beta-blockade can potentiate insulin-induced hypoglycemia in diabetics and delay the recovery of normal blood glucose levels. Prolonged and severe hypoglycemia may occur, although these events have rarely been reported. Significant increases in blood pressure and bradycardia can also occur during hypoglycemia in diabetics treated with insulin and beta-blockers due to antagonism of epinephrine''s effect on beta-2 adrenergic receptors, which leads to unopposed alpha-adrenergic effects including vasoconstriction. Other effects reported with various beta-blockers include decreased glucose tolerance and decreased glucose-induced insulin secretion.', NULL, 'In general, cardioselective beta-blockers are considered safer than noncardioselective agents in the treatment of diabetic patients.', NULL, 'In general, cardioselective beta-blockers are considered safer than noncardioselective agents in the treatment of diabetic patients. Patients should be advised of the need for regular blood glucose monitoring and be aware that certain symptoms of hypoglycemia such as tremor and tachycardia may be masked.

Prolonged and severe hypoglycemia may occur, although these events have rarely been reported. Significant increases in blood pressure and bradycardia can also occur during hypoglycemia in diabetics treated with insulin and beta-blockers due to antagonism of epinephrine''s effect on beta-2 adrenergic receptors, which leads to unopposed alpha-adrenergic effects including vasoconstriction.
