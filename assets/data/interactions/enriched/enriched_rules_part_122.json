Because NSAIDs reduce the rate of ulcer healing in the stomach and duodenum, it is also possible that NSAIDs may delay healing and exaggerate the mucosal injury caused by oral bisphosphonates. Theoretical concerns exist regarding the potential for increased risk and severity of renal impairment during coadministration of bisphosphonates with high dosages or chronic use of NSAIDs due to additive or synergistic nephrotoxic effects on the kidney. The use of bisphosphonates has been associated with nephrotoxicity manifested as deterioration of renal function and renal failure. Cases have primarily involved intravenous formulations of the drugs such as pamidronic acid and zoledronic acid, especially when they are administered too rapidly. The risk of hypocalcemia may also be increased, as drug-induced renal tubular damage can lead to renal loss of calcium and other electrolytes such as magnesium. Bisphosphonates alone often cause mild, asymptomatic hypocalcemia via inhibitive effects on bone resorption and possibly chelation of blood calcium. Chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be associated with renal toxicities including elevations in serum creatinine and BUN, tubular necrosis, glomerulitis, renal papillary necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and renal failure.",

Serotonin syndrome is a rare but serious and potentially fatal condition thought to result from hyperstimulation of brainstem 5-HT1A and 2A receptors. Symptoms of the serotonin syndrome may include mental status changes such as irritability, altered consciousness, confusion, hallucinations, and coma; autonomic dysfunction such as tachycardia, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, shivering, blood pressure lability, and mydriasis; neuromuscular abnormalities such as hyperreflexia, myoclonus, tremor, rigidity, and ataxia; and gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Since many serotonergic agents can also cause central nervous system depression, concomitant use with opioids may result in increased sedation and impairment of judgment, thinking, and psychomotor skills.",
