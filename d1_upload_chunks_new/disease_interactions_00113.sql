Gatifloxacin has been known to cause hypoglycemic episodes generally within the first 3 days of therapy and sometimes even after the first dose, while hyperglycemia usually occurs 4 to 10 days after initiation of therapy.  Patients should be counseled to recognize symptoms of hypoglycemia such as headache, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, tremor, weakness, hunger, excessive perspiration, and palpitations.
