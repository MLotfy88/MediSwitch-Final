The mechanism is competitive inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase by certain NSAIDs, which, unlike aspirin, bind reversibly at the active site of the enzyme and cause a temporary rather than persistent depression of thromboxane formation and thromboxane-dependent platelet function. The combined use of aspirin with NSAIDs in general may increase the potential for serious gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity, including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation.

The mechanism is competitive inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase by certain NSAIDs, which, unlike aspirin, bind reversibly at the active site of the enzyme and cause a temporary rather than persistent depression of thromboxane formation and thromboxane-dependent platelet function. The combined use of aspirin with NSAIDs in general may increase the potential for serious gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity, including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation.
