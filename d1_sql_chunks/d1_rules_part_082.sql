The clinical significance and underlying etiology of the bradycardia observed with thalidomide treatment have not been established. However, the potential for additive bradycardic effects should be considered when used with other drugs that slow cardiac conduction such as beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digitalis, flecainide, moricizine, and propafenone. Non-cardiac drugs that may also cause bradycardia include atazanavir, lacosamide, lithium, mefloquine, succinylcholine, H2-receptor antagonists, tricyclic antidepressants, and anticholinesterase or cholinergic agents.
