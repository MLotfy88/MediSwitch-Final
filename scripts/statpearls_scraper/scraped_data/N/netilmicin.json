    "indications": "Conjunctivitis is one of the most common causes of red-eye and affects patients of all ages and socioeconomic class. Viral conjunctivitis is responsible for the majority of infectious conjunctivitis, accounting for up to 75% of cases.\n[1]\n[2]\nCharacteristics of viral conjunctivitis include redness, blood vessel engorgement, ocular discharge, pain, photophobia, and pseudomembranes. There is a considerable economic and societal impact due to the costs of visits to the emergency department or general practitioner, diagnostic tests, prescription treatment, and time lost from work or school. Prescribing antibiotics in cases of viral conjunctivitis is one of the major costs of any healthcare system. The rates of antibiotic treatment in the community for patients with infectious conjunctivitis in the United Kingdom range between 80% and 95%.\n[3]\n[4]\nImprovement in diagnostic rates of viral conjunctivitis is estimated to have reduced inappropriate antibiotic prescribing and saved US $430 million per year in the United States.\n[2]\nSpecific treatments for viral conjunctivitis are currently being assessed in clinical trials. Due to the non-specificity of signs and symptoms, a thorough medical and ophthalmic history with clinical examination should be obtained, especially in patients with atypical signs and a chronic course.",
    "mechanism": "The conjunctiva is a thin semitransparent membrane that covers the white part of the eye called the sclera. The conjunctiva starts at the limbus of the cornea and covers both the sclera and posterior surface of the eyelids. The portion covering the scleral is referred to as the bulbar conjunctiva, and the portion on the posterior surface of the lids is the palpebral conjunctiva.\n\nThe most common cause of viral conjunctivitis is adenoviruses. The adenovirus is part of the\nAdenoviridae\nfamily that consists of a nonenveloped, double-stranded DNA virus. Frequently associated infections caused by the adenovirus include upper respiratory tract infections, eye infections, and diarrhea in children. Children are most susceptible to viral infections, and adults tend to get more bacterial infections. Viral conjunctivitis can be obtained by direct contact with the virus, airborne transmission, and reservoir such as swimming pools.\n[5]\n[6]\n\nMost cases of viral conjunctivitis are highly contagious for 10-14 days. Washing hands and avoidance of eye contact are key to preventing transmission to others.\n\nAdenoviral Conjunctivitis\n\nUp to 90% of viral conjunctivitis cases are caused by adenoviruses.\n[7]\nIn children pharyngoconjunctival fever (PCF) due to HAdV types 3, 4, and 7 results in acute follicular conjunctivitis with fever, pharyngitis, periauricular lymphadenopathy. Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) is the most severe ocular infection caused by adenovirus and is classically associated with serotypes 8, 19, and 37. The cornea can be affected by the viral replication in the epithelium and anterior stroma leading to superficial punctate keratopathy and subepithelial infiltrates.\n[8]\nMonotherapy with povidone-iodine 2% have demonstrated the resolution of symptoms.\n[9]\nFurther combinations of povidone-iodine with corticosteroids are undergoing phase 3 randomized controlled studies. Visual symptoms caused by subepithelial infiltrates can be debilitating and the use of tacrolimus, 1% and 2% cyclosporine A eye drops have been shown to effective.\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n\nHerpetic Conjunctivitis\n\nHerpes conjunctivitis is common in adults and children and associated with follicular conjunctivitis. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is estimated to be responsible for 1.3 - 4.8% of acute conjunctivitis cases.\n[13]\nTreatment with topical antiviral agents is aimed at reducing virus shedding and the development of keratitis. Varicella-zoster can cause conjunctivitis either by direct contact of the eye or skin lesions or inhalation of infected aerosolized particles, especially with the involvement of the first and second branches of the trigeminal nerve.\n\nAcute Hemorrhagic Conjunctivitis (AHC)\n\nThis is a very contagious form of viral conjunctivitis and symptoms include foreign body sensation, epiphora, eyelid edema, conjunctival chemosis, and subconjunctival hemorrhage. A small proportion of patients experience systemic symptoms of fever, fatigue, limb pain. Transmission is primarily via hand to eye contact and fomites.\n[14]\nPicornaviruses EV70 and coxsackievirus A24 variant (CA24v) are thought to be the responsible pathogens.\n[15]\n\nCOVID-19 Conjunctivitis\n\nThe most recent isolated strain of coronavirus, COVID-19 has been reported to cause conjunctivitis along with fever, cough, respiratory distress, and death.\n[16]\nRetrospective and prospective studies show that 1% to 6% of patients display COVID-19 related conjunctivitis, with conjunctival swabs being positive in 2.5% of cases.\n[17]\nTransmission through ocular tissues is incompletely understood. Ophthalmologists are at higher risk for COVID-19 infection due to the close proximity to patients, equipment intense clinics, direct contact with patients' conjunctival mucosal surfaces, and high-volume clinics. Systemic COVID-19 is contracted through direct or airborne inhalation of respiratory droplets. Additional protective measures such as social distancing, wearing masks, reduced clinic volumes, and sterilization of surfaces should be practiced to reduce transmission risk.",
    "monitoring": "Laboratory testing is typically not indicated unless the symptoms are not resolving and infection last longer than 4 weeks. Laboratory testing can be indicated in certain situations such as a suspected chlamydial infection in a newborn, an immune-compromised patient, excessive amounts of discharge, or suspected gonorrhea co-infection. In the office, physicians can run tests to positively identify adenovirus with a specificity and sensitivity of 89% and 94%, respectively. However, ophthalmologists usually can make the diagnosis clinically with confirmational additional testing.\n[23]\n\nRegarding adenovirus testing, the gold standard has traditionally been cell culture because once the virus is isolated, the diagnosis is definitive and the characterization of the virus can be undertaken.\n[24]\nDisadvantages include cost and increased time associated with cell culture-based testing. The mainstay of viral conjunctivitis testing in the developed world is the detection of viral DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR for adenovirus has been shown to be 93% sensitive and 97.3% specific from conjunctival swabs, with similar values, found for HSV diagnosis.\n[24]\nA recent development has been the creation of a rapid detection testing platform for adenovirus, the AdenoPlus assay (Rapid Pathogen Screening Inc., Sarasota, Florida, USA). This is a swift office-based test designed to detect 53 serotypes of adenovirus and provide a result within 10 minutes.\n[25]\nStudies have demonstrated high specificity values of 92% to 98% in detecting adenoviral conjunctivitis.\n[26]\n[27]\n[28]\nHowever, the test has lower sensitivity reported compared with PCR analysis.\n[26]\n[27]\n[28]\nRapid detection testing can be more useful in the future once viral conjunctivitis treatments reach the clinical setting.\n[29]",
    "administration": "Treatment for viral conjunctivitis is aimed at symptomatic relief and not to eradicate the self-limiting viral infection. The resolution of conjunctivitis can take up to 3 weeks. Treatment includes using artificial tears for lubrication four times a day or up to ten times a day with preservative-free tears. Cool compresses with a wet washcloth to the periocular area may provide symptomatic relief. Preventing the spread of infection to the other eye or other people requires the patient to practice good hand hygiene with frequent washing, avoidance of sharing towels or linens, and avoiding touching their eyes. A person is thought to shed the virus while their eyes are red and tearing.\n\nIf a membrane or pseudomembrane is present, it can be peeled at the slit lamp to improve patient comfort and prevent any scar formation from occurring. These membranes can either be peeled with a jeweler forceps or a cotton swab soaked with topical anesthetic. Topical steroids can help with the resolution of symptoms. However, they can also cause the shedding of the virus to last longer. Patients should be informed that they are highly contagious and should refrain from work or school until their symptoms resolve. While using steroids, they may still shed the virus without the visual symptoms that would indicate that they have an infection. Steroids should be reserved for patients with decreased vision due to their subepithelial infiltrates or severe conjunctival injection causing more the expected discomfort.\n[30]\n[31]\n\nThe use of povidone-iodine, a non-specific disinfectant, is a promising new treatment for adenoviral conjunctivitis.\n[25]\nThis is an inexpensive and widely available antiseptic solution which is used as part of the aseptic preparation for ocular surgery. It is able to kill extracellular organisms but has no effect intracellularly. It does not induce drug resistance because its mechanism of action is not immunologically dependent. A single dose of 2.5% povidone-iodine in infants with adenoviral conjunctivitis resulted in a reduction in symptom severity and reduced recovery time without significant side effects.\n[32]\n\nTopical corticosteroids alone are contraindicated in epithelial herpes simplex keratitis and are associated with prolonged viral shedding and infection.\n[29]\nWhen used in combination with an anti-infective, corticosteroids have demonstrated good tolerability and efficacy in treating the inflammatory and infectious components of conjunctivitis.\n[33]\n[34]",
