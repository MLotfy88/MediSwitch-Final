    "clinical_significance": "Iatrogenic hypercortisolism is the most common cause of Cushing syndrome. Recognizing it before these individuals are subject to further diagnostic testing is crucial; instead, the focus should be on titrating down\nor discontinuing, if feasible, the prescribed steroid dosage.\n[50]\nThe dexamethasone suppression test must be performed and interpreted in the light of the pretest probability based on a detailed history and thorough physical examination. In addition, clinicians should be mindful of diagnostic accuracy, limitations, and interfering factors associated with all tests.\n[51]\nIn cases with high clinical suspicion of Cushing syndrome but equivocal or negative test results, repeat testing should occur in 3 to 6 months, as untreated hypercortisolemia has detrimental consequences.\n[52]"
