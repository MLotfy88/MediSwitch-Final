    "Background": {
      "text": "Massive transfusion protocol (MTP) has no universal definition but is generally considered as:\nTransfusion of >10 units of packed red blood cells within a 24-hour period OR\nTransfusion of >4 units of packed red blood cells within 1 hour, with anticipation of requiring more transfusion within the next 24 hours\nReplacement of >1 blood volume in 24 h or >50% of the blood volume in 4 h\nIn addition to controlling hemorrhage the greatest concern during MTP is the lethal triad:\n[2]\nHypothermia\nCoagulopathy\nAcidosis\nTrauma Associated Coagulopathy\n[3]\nPlatelet defects (worse with\nTBI\n), endothelial injury, and loss of coagulation factors and platelets through hemorrhage consumption of platelets and coagulation factors\nDuring MTP, focus is on \"balanced resuscitation\" with clotting factors (FFP) and platelets”\n[4]\nThe PROPPR trial\n[5]\nexamined a 1:1:1 (FFP:Plt:pRBC) vs 1:1:2 protocol.  There was no difference in mortality at 1 or 30 days; however, the 1:1:1 group experienced less death due to exsanguination in the first day.\nThe goal of MTP is to resuscitate and temporize management until definitive operative repair can be accomplished.\nMTP should follow should follow local institutional protocols\n[6]",
