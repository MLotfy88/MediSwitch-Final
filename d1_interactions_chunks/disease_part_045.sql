These serious adverse events can develop at any time, with or without warning symptoms.  Only 1 in 5 patients who develop a serious upper GI side effect on NSAIDs is symptomatic.  NSAIDs should be used with caution in patients with history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding, as these patients had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors.  Caution is also advised if NSAIDs are prescribed to patients with other factors that increase risk of GI bleeding, such as:  prolonged NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), anticoagulants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; alcohol use; smoking; history of gastrointestinal surgery or anastomosis, older age; poor general health status; and advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy.  Particular vigilance is necessary when treating elderly or debilitated patients since most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in these patients.', '3', '"Product Information.
