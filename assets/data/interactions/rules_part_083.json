Pharmacokinetically, propoxyphene is an inhibitor of CYP450 2D6 and may increase the plasma concentrations of many psychotropic agents that are metabolized by the isoenzyme such as phenothiazines, haloperidol, risperidone, phenobarbital, and some tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin reuptake inhibitors.",

Serotonin syndrome is a rare but serious and potentially fatal condition thought to result from hyperstimulation of brainstem 5-HT1A and 2A receptors. Symptoms may include mental status changes such as irritability, altered consciousness, confusion, hallucinations, and coma; autonomic dysfunction such as tachycardia, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, shivering, blood pressure lability, and mydriasis; neuromuscular abnormalities such as hyperreflexia, myoclonus, tremor, and ataxia; and gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.",
