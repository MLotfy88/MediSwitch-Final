Coadministration of narcotic analgesics including morphine in patients treated with MAOIs has rarely resulted in hypotension, respiratory depression, or coma.

Symptoms of the excitatory reaction may include agitation, headache, diaphoresis, hyperpyrexia, flushing, shivering, myoclonus, rigidity, tremor, diarrhea, hypertension, tachycardia, seizures, and coma.  Death has occurred in some cases.  The exact mechanism of interaction is unknown, but may involve excessive serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (i.e., serotonin syndrome).  The interaction is unpredictable and has been reported primarily with meperidine or fentanyl and various MAOIs including phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid, moclobemide, and selegiline.  Fatal hyperpyrexia and hypertension have also been observed in animal studies with meperidine and phenelzine or furazolidone.
