Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of adverse cardiovascular events throughout the entire duration of therapy, even without prior cardiovascular symptoms.  Patients should be advised to promptly seek medical attention if they experience symptoms of cardiovascular thrombotic events (including chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, or slurring of speech).NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.  Two large clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke.The use of NSAIDs should be avoided in patients with a recent myocardial infarction unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent cardiovascular thrombotic events.  If an NSAID is used in patients with a recent myocardial infarction, they should be monitored for signs of cardiac ischemia.', '3', '"Product Information. Indocin (indomethacin)."

These reactions are characterized by spastic contraction of discrete muscle groups and may include torticollis, opisthotonos, carpopedal spasm, trismus, difficulty swallowing, perioral spasms with protrusion of the tongue, and oculogyric crisis.  Onset is usually within 24 to 96 hours following initiation of therapy or an increase in dosage.  Risk factors include young age, male gender, use of high-potency agents (e.g., fluphenazine, perphenazine, trifluoperazine), high dosages, and IM administration.  Therapy with phenothiazines should be administered cautiously in patients, particularly children, with hypocalcemia or severe dehydration, since these patients may be more susceptible to dystonic reactions.  Most symptoms subside within a few hours and are almost always reversible within 24 to 48 hours following withdrawal of therapy.  However, severe reactions such as laryngospasm may be life-threatening and require appropriate supportive therapy.  Parenteral administration of an anticholinergic antiparkinsonian agent (e.g., benztropine, trihexyphenidyl) or diphenhydramine usually produces a prompt response and may be given orally for short-term maintenance to prevent recurrence of symptoms if phenothiazine therapy must be continued.', '2', 'Wood G, Waters A "Prolonged dystonic reaction to chlorpromazine in myxoedema coma."

Elderly patients, particularly women, are most susceptible.  Also, propylpiperazine derivatives like fluphenazine, perphenazine, prochlorperazine, and trifluoperazine may be more likely to induce this syndrome.  Both the risk of developing TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible increase with the duration and total cumulative dose of phenothiazine therapy administered.  However, patients may infrequently develop symptoms after relatively brief treatment periods at low dosages.  If TD occurs during phenothiazine therapy, prompt withdrawal of the offending agent or at least a lowering of the dosage should be considered.  TD symptoms usually become more severe after drug discontinuation or a dosage reduction, but may gradually improve over months to years.  In patients with preexisting drug-induced TD, initiating or increasing the dosage of phenothiazine therapy may temporarily mask the symptoms of TD but may eventually worsen the condition.  The newer, atypical neuroleptic agents (e.g., risperidone, quetiapine, olanzapine) tend to be associated with a substantially reduced risk of inducing TD and are considered the drugs of choice in patients being treated for psychosis.', '2', 'Yassa R, Dimitry R "Single phenothiazines and tardive dyskinesia."

Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin.  An unexplained drop in hematocrit or blood pressure, or any other unexplained symptom, should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event.  Therapy with heparin should be used with extreme caution in patients with known bleeding disorders or disease states that may predispose to hemorrhage during heparin administration, including hemophilia, thrombocytopenia, certain vascular purpuras, ulcerative gastrointestinal lesions, diverticulitis, ulcerative colitis, severe liver disease, subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension, myeloproliferative disorders, and threatened abortion.  Blood coagulation tests (e.g., whole blood clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time) should be performed at appropriate intervals during full-dose heparin administration.  In addition, periodic platelet counts, hematocrits, and tests for occult blood in stool are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy.  There is usually no need to monitor coagulation parameters in patients receiving low-dose heparin, except in patients undergoing major surgery.  For low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), coagulation tests such as prothrombin time (PT) and aPTT are relatively insensitive measures of LMWH activity and not suitable for routine monitoring.

Acute thrombocytopenia can occur in patients receiving heparin, with a reported incidence of up to 30%.  Platelet counts should be obtained before and periodically during heparin administration, including regular and repeated use of heparin flush solutions if given for longer than 5 days.  Mild thrombocytopenia with counts above 100,000/mm3 may remain stable or reverse despite continued heparin administration.  However, thrombocytopenia of any degree should be closely monitored.  Therapy should be discontinued if the count falls below 100,000/mm3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, and an alternative, nonheparin anticoagulant (e.g., argatroban, bivalirudin, lepirudin) administered if necessary.  Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction resulting from irreversible aggregation of platelets.  HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT).  Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT, and may include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal artery thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death.  Both HIT and HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy.  Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin should be evaluated for HIT and HITT.

Direct stimulation of cardiac tissues is mediated by beta- 1 receptors and thus less likely to occur with beta-2-selective agents such as albuterol.  However, beta-2-selectivity is not absolute and can be lost with larger doses.  High dosages of these agents have been associated with precipitation or aggravation of angina, myocardial ischemia, and cardiac arrhythmias.
