If anaphylaxis occurs, clinicians should be aware that beta-blockers may attenuate the response to epinephrine. Thus, larger doses of epinephrine may be necessary to overcome the bronchospasm, although such large doses can also cause excessive alpha-adrenergic stimulation resulting in hypertension, reflex bradycardia, heart block, and possible potentiation of bronchospasm. Alternative treatments recommended include vigorous supportive care (e.g., fluids) and the use of parenteral beta-agonists for bronchospasm and norepinephrine for hypotension.",

Prolonged and severe hypoglycemia may occur, although these events have rarely been reported. Significant increases in blood pressure and bradycardia can also occur during hypoglycemia in diabetics treated with insulin and beta-blockers due to antagonism of epinephrine's effect on beta-2 adrenergic receptors, which leads to unopposed alpha-adrenergic effects including vasoconstriction.

Presumably, beta-1 selectivity is dose-dependent and may be lost given a sufficient dose of the beta-blocker in susceptible patients.
