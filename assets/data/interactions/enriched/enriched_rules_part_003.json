Paroxetine and norfluoxetine (the active metabolite of fluoxetine), in particular, are potent inhibitors of CYP450 2D6 and may be more likely than other SSRIs to cause the interaction.

Cardiac function should be closely monitored and the beta-blocker dosage adjusted accordingly, particularly following initiation, discontinuation or change of dosage of SSRI in patients who are stabilized on their beta-blocker regimen. Due to the long half-life of fluoxetine and its active metabolite, norfluoxetine, the risk of an interaction may exist for an extended period (up to several weeks) after discontinuation of fluoxetine.

Serotonin syndrome is a rare but serious and potentially fatal condition thought to result from hyperstimulation of brainstem 5-HT1A and 2A receptors. Symptoms of the serotonin syndrome may include mental status changes such as irritability, altered consciousness, confusion, hallucinations, and coma; autonomic dysfunction such as tachycardia, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, shivering, blood pressure lability, and mydriasis; neuromuscular abnormalities such as hyperreflexia, myoclonus, tremor, rigidity, and ataxia; and gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Since many serotonergic agents can also cause central nervous system depression, concomitant use with opioids may result in increased sedation and impairment of judgment, thinking, and psychomotor skills.",

      "effect": "Coadministration with drugs that are inhibitors of CYP450 2D6 may increase the plasma concentrations of tolterodine, which is primarily metabolized by this isoenzyme in patients that are extensive metabolizers, or EMs (approximately 93% of Caucasians and more than 98% of Asians and individuals of African descent). Moreover, since the active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite (5-HM) generated by CYP450 2D6 is equipotent compared with tolterodine, and the sum of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HM are only 25% higher during the interaction, little alteration in the overall pharmacologic activity would be expected. Thus, dosage reductions should not be necessary.",

Progressive hypercalcemia due to overdosage of vitamin D and its metabolites can be dangerous and sufficiently severe as to require emergency attention. Acute hypercalcemia may exacerbate tendencies for cardiac arrhythmias and seizures and may potentiate the action of digitalis drugs. Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification, nephrocalcinosis, and calcifications of the cornea or other soft tissues. Immobilized patients are particularly vulnerable to the risk of hypercalcemia.",

An estimate of daily dietary calcium intake should be made and the intake adjusted when indicated. Patients should be advised to avoid an abrupt increase in dietary calcium intake, as it may trigger hypercalcemia, and to contact their physician if they experience early symptoms of vitamin D intoxication associated with hypercalcemia such as weakness, fatigue, headache, somnolence, vertigo, tinnitus, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, metallic taste, muscle pain, bone pain, ataxia, and hypotonia. Late symptoms may include polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, nocturia, conjunctivitis, photophobia, rhinorrhea, pruritus, hyperthermia, decreased libido, and cardiac arrhythmias. Radiographic evaluation of suspect anatomical regions may be useful in the early detection of hypercalcemia. If hypercalcemia develops, treatment with vitamin D and any calcium product should be stopped immediately.",

Theoretical concerns exist regarding the potential for increased risk and severity of renal impairment during coadministration of bisphosphonates with high dosages or chronic use of NSAIDs due to additive or synergistic nephrotoxic effects on the kidney. The use of bisphosphonates has been associated with nephrotoxicity manifested as deterioration of renal function and renal failure. Cases have primarily involved intravenous formulations of the drugs such as pamidronic acid and zoledronic acid, especially when they are administered too rapidly. The risk of hypocalcemia may also be increased, as drug-induced renal tubular damage can lead to renal loss of calcium and other electrolytes such as magnesium. Bisphosphonates alone often cause mild, asymptomatic hypocalcemia via inhibitive effects on bone resorption and possibly chelation of blood calcium. Chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be associated with renal toxicities including elevations in serum creatinine and BUN, tubular necrosis, glomerulitis, renal papillary necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and renal failure.",
