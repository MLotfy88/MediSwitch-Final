Hepatic function should be monitored in all patients; a higher frequency of liver enzyme elevations was observed in pediatrics.  Serum transaminase levels and bilirubin should be measured at the start of therapy and monitored at least weekly for the first month of therapy; monitoring frequency can be reduced to monthly during continued use if no clinically significant changes are observed.  If liver function tests increase significantly from baseline, voriconazole should be discontinued unless, after assessing the benefit/risk to the patient, continued use is justified.Voriconazole is primarily metabolized by the liver and has been shown to accumulate significantly in patients with impaired hepatic function.
