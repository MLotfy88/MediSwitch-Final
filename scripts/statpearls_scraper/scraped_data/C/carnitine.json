    "indications": "Carnitine (beta-hydroxy-gamma-trimethylammonium butyrate) is an indispensable water-soluble molecule derived from amino acids.\n[1]\n[2]\nIn non-vegetarians, dietary intake is the primary source of carnitine and accounts for almost three-fourths of the total body stores.\n[3]\nThe main dietary source of carnitine is red meat, poultry, and dairy products.\n[4]\nThe bioavailability of dietary carnitine is between 54% to 87%.\n[5]\nThe remaining one-fourth of the carnitine pool can be produced endogenously from lysine and methionine mostly by the liver and kidneys.\n[3]\n[6]\nVegetarians have a relatively lower plasma carnitine level than non-vegetarians.\n[7]\nIn strict vegetarians, most of the carnitine (>90%) is produced endogenously.\n[3]\nDespite variabilities in dietary carnitine intake, the plasma carnitine level is maintained within the normal range by an efficient renal reabsorption system while excessive carnitine is promptly excreted in the urine.\n[8]\nAbout 90% to 99% of the filtered carnitine is usually reabsorbed by the renal tubules.\n[3]\n\nCarnitine plays a substantial physiological role in lipid metabolism and intermediary metabolic pathways.\n[5]\nThrough the carnitine shuttle, carnitine helps in transporting the long-chain fatty acids from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial matrix for subsequent degradation for beta-oxidation, which is detailed in the pathophysiology section (figure).\n[3]\nPlasma carnitine accounts for approximately 0.5% of the total body stores, and the remaining vast majority is found within the cells.\n[3]\n[5]\nAs carnitine is essential for fueling the exercising muscle through fatty acid oxidation and energy production via the Krebs’s cycle, more than 95% of total body carnitine is found in skeletal muscle.\n[5]\n[7]\n[9]\nThe liver, heart, and kidneys have the rest of the carnitine stores.\n[5]",
    "mechanism": "Primary carnitine deficiency (PCD) due to carnitine transport defect is an autosomal recessive (AR) genetic disorder of the OCTN2 (organic carnitine transporter novel type 2) carnitine-transporter system encoded by the\nSLC22A5\ngene.\n[4]\nCarnitine transport defect causes a significant carnitine depletion and decreases intracellular carnitine accumulation due to deficient active carnitine transport across the plasma membrane. PCD is characterized by low plasma carnitine levels, reduced intracellular carnitine, and increased urinary loss.\n[5]\nCarnitine is transported intracellularly via OCTN2, which is expressed predominantly in skeletal and cardiac muscles, and kidneys.\n[3]\nDecreased OCTN2 on the plasma membrane results in a reduced intracellular update of carnitine.\n[5]\nIn kidneys, this results in reduced reabsorption of carnitine, and patients with PCD may lose up to 95% of the filtered carnitine in the urine.\n[6]\nThe parents of a child with PCD, who are heterozygous carriers, may lose twice or thrice the levels of normal urinary excretion.\n[6]\nThe plasma concentration of acyl-carnitine esters is also low in PCD.\n[5]",
    "monitoring": "When carnitine deficiency is suspected, the first step is to measure plasma carnitine levels.\n[13]\nPatients with PCD have low plasma free carnitine levels (< 5 μmol/L, normal 20–50 μmol/L).\n[4]\n[6]\nPrompt referral to a metabolic specialist should be done and genetic testing is performed to confirm the diagnosis. Sequence analysis of the\nSLC22A5\ngene, followed by the array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) if the sequence analysis is not conclusive. There is usually a poor correlation between genotype and phenotypic expression in PCD.\n[6]\n[18]\nSome investigators have noted nonsense and frameshift mutations more commonly in symptomatic patients, and in asymptomatic mothers with PCD (identified by positive newborn screening of their infants), missense mutations and in-frame deletion are commonly reported.\n[18]\n\nIf genetic testing fails to confirm PCD diagnosis, functional assay such as the cultured skin fibroblast carnitine assay is the preferred test. In PCD, the OCTN2 transporter activity is <10% of normal controls.\n[14]\nOnce PCD diagnosis is confirmed, the patient should undergo a series of investigations including echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, serum creatine kinase (CK), serum transaminases, and blood sugar levels.\n[14]\nOther biochemical tests such as plasma acylcarnitine profile and urine organic acid analysis may be required to evaluate other conditions resulting in secondary carnitine deficiency which are detailed in the differential diagnoses section.\n[13]\n\nIn the U.S., the newborn screening test includes evaluation for PCD. By tandem mass spectrometry method, low plasma free carnitine levels are detected in newborns with PCD. Due to placental transfer of carnitine from the mother to the fetus, low fetal plasma creatinine levels shortly after birth can reflect the maternal plasma carnitine levels. Some mothers are diagnosed following their infants being detected with carnitine deficiency in their newborn screening tests. Therefore, if the newborn screening detects low carnitine levels, both the baby and the mother are re-tested, after two weeks, to determine who has PCD.\n[14]",
    "administration": "The mainstay of primary carnitine deficiency involves lifelong treatment with a high dose of oral L-carnitine (100 to 200 mg/kg daily dose in 3 divided doses).\n[3]\n[4]\nThe oral bioavailability of L-carnitine is 5% to 18%.\n[5]\nL-carnitine is a fairly safe medication, and few side effects associated with high doses include diarrhea and intestinal discomfort. Additionally, bacterial degradation of unabsorbed oral L-carnitine in the bowel results in trimethylamine, which has a peculiar fishy odor.\n[3]\n[6]\nThese side effects can be minimized by decrease the L-carnitine dose or treatment with a 7 to 10-day course of oral metronidazole, which could eradicate the intestinal bacterial overgrowth.\n[13]\n\nMaintenance therapy with L-carnitine can improve plasma levels, and the dose is titrated based on the plasma levels and also on the response.\n[3]\nContinued L-carnitine administration prevents hypoglycemic episodes as well as cause improvement in myopathic symptoms. The muscle carnitine levels rise slightly (only up to 5% to 10% of controls), due to the abnormal OCTN2 which is unable to increase the uptake of carnitine into the myocyte adequately.\n[5]\n[8]\nCarnitine enters mostly by passive diffusion from plasma and via low-affinity transporters, and this modest increase is enough to prevent muscle complications.\n[8]\n\nAcute episodes of hypoglycemia in children with PCD are promptly treated with intravenous 10% dextrose and treatment of accompanying metabolic abnormalities (e.g., acid-base abnormalities), along with immediate carnitine supplementation.\n[8]\n[17]\n[8]\nIt is crucial to avoid episodes of hypoglycemia in PCD by frequent feeding and avoiding fast states.\n[17]",
    "adverse_effects": "Generally, PCD is well tolerated with early diagnosis followed by prompt and aggressive management with L-carnitine. The clinical manifestations and severity of symptoms can be variable between patients with PCD. Undiagnosed or poorly controlled PCD may lead to severe complications. Hypoglycemic episodes can result in convulsions and brain damage.\n[15]\nUntreated episodes of hypoglycemia may progress to coma and death.\n[8]\nMetabolic abnormalities can cause hepatic dysfunction that also may progress to hepatic encephalopathy culminating in death.\n[15]\nCardiac abnormalities include cardiomyopathy, which can be fatal, especially during the neonatal period or early childhood; left ventricular hypertrophy that can progress to dilated cardiomyopathy and subsequent decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction; pericardial effusion; and arrhythmias including the long QT syndrome.\n[15]\nUntreated asymptomatic adults are also at risk of the development of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death.\n[3]"
