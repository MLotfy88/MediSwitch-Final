    "clinical_significance": "Tumor biomarkers each possess some degree of clinical utility and correlate to one or several specific malignancies. Many tumor biomarkers are expressed to some degree by normal, healthy cells or tissues, and levels of circulating biomarkers can be affected by benign conditions. The sensitivity and specificity of each assay must be considered within the context of the clinical condition of the patient.\n[30]\n\nThere are many national and international guidelines on the selection and utilization of tumor biomarkers. The National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry, the European Group on Tumor Markers, the American Cancer Society, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence have established recommendations regarding the use of tumor biomarkers based on the level of available evidence.\n\nThe clinical significance of some commonly measured tumor biomarkers is described in\nTable 2.\nThe Clinical Significance of Selected Tumor Biomarkers.\n\nTable\nTable 2. The Clinical Significance of Selected Tumor Biomarkers."
