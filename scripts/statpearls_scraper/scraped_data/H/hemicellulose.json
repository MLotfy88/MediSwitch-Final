    "clinical_significance": "Dietary fiber plays a vital role in preventing and managing many chronic diseases. A high-fiber diet is strongly linked to a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, certain cancers (especially colorectal and pancreatic), diverticular disease, and overall mortality, while also enhancing digestive health, glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, cholesterol levels, and supporting a healthy gut microbiome.\n[17]\n[18]\nSoluble fiber delays gastric emptying and increases stomach viscosity, which promotes satiety, reduces total caloric intake, and aids in weight regulation.\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n\nFiber also lowers LDL cholesterol and blood pressure.\n[22]\nGut bacteria ferment fiber to produce short-chain fatty acids, which have anti-inflammatory effects that further support gut and metabolic health.\n[23]\nFiber has been linked to improved immune function through both microbiota-dependent and independent mechanisms, providing benefits such as increased resistance to infection, reduced inflammation, and protection against immune-mediated chronic diseases.\n[24]\n[25]\nAdditionally, certain soluble fibers like pectin may have antioxidant properties that help prevent cancers, including breast cancer.\n\nCurrent evidence indicates a modest but meaningful protective link between higher dietary fiber intake and lower breast cancer risk, especially in premenopausal women who consume fiber-rich fruits and vegetables.\n[26]\n[27]\nFiber is essential for gastrointestinal health, helping to prevent constipation, diverticular disease, and functional bowel disorders. It also offers benefits for metabolic syndrome, metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), and may slow the progression of chronic kidney disease.\n[28]\n[29]\nLarge reviews and meta-analyses consistently show that diets high in fiber, both from whole foods and supplements like psyllium, provide broad protective effects on cardiometabolic, digestive, and overall health, establishing it as a key component of dietary advice for disease prevention and health maintenance.\n[30]\n[31]"
