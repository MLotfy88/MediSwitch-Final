      "text": "Assesses likelihood that patient with chest pain and baseline\nLBBB\nhas myocardial damage. Developed in 1996 by Elena Sgarbossa\n[1]\nCriteria also applies to\nLBBB\ndue to ventricularly paced rhythm, with more recent reviews demonstrating ~98% specificity when QRS amplitude taken into consideration\n[2]\n[3]\nOriginal Criteria had low sensitivity(20%), high specificity (98%)\nTwo main issues suggested for low sensitivity of original rule. First, use of CK (with or without MB) for diagnosis of acute MI, not angiography. Therefore both STEMI & NSTEMI included in acute MI group. Second, anterior STEMI diagnosis limited by criteria absolute 5mm ST elevation\n[4]\nStill consider PCI/t-PA for patients with LBBB and \"good story\" despite not meeting the criteria\nPreviously, a new or presumably new LBBB was indication for emergent reperfusion therapy (i.e. STEMI equivalent)\nGuidelines were changed in 2013 due to a high number of false positives\nLBBB should now be taken into consideration, but no longer indication for emergent cardiac catheterization\n[5]\nSubsequent Smith Modification improves sensitivity (91%) for a slightly lower specificity (90%), and was validated by Meyers et al in 2015\n[6]",
