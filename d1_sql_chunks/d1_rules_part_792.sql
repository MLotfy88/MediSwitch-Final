For Haemophilus influenzae b vaccine, some experts recommend that it be administered at least 2 weeks before starting or 3 months after discontinuing chemotherapy when used in patients with Hodgkin''s disease.  For rabies vaccine, some authorities suggest that immunosuppressive agents should generally be avoided during postexposure therapy except when absolutely necessary for the treatment of other conditions.  For SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) vaccines, vaccination should preferably be completed at least two weeks before initiation or resumption of immunosuppressive therapies; however, decisions to delay or temporarily withhold immunosuppressive therapy to complete COVID-19 vaccination should consider the individual''s risks relative to their underlying condition.  Additional shots and/or boosters may be appropriate depending on age, prior COVID-19 vaccine formulation(s) received, and other factors in individuals with moderate to severe immune compromise due to medical conditions or immunosuppressive medications or treatments (e.g., solid organ transplant recipients on immunosuppressive therapy; patients on active treatment for solid tumor and hematologic malignancies).  Vaccines may generally be administered to patients receiving corticosteroids as replacement therapy (e.g., for Addison''s disease).', 'Others', NULL, NULL, 'Moderate', NULL, 'DDInter', 'pharmacodynamic', 1767317477);
