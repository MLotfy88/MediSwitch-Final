A routine oral examination should be performed prior to initiation of treatment.  Risk factors for ONJ include cancer, radiotherapy, poor oral hygiene, preexisting dental disease or infection, anemia, and coagulopathy, and concomitant use of other drugs associated with ONJ (e.g., chemotherapy, bisphosphonates).  Patients requiring invasive dental procedures, require clinical judgment of the treating physician and/or oral surgeon to guide the management plan based on benefit-risk assessment.  Patients who are suspected of having or who develop ONJ while on romosozumab treatment, should receive care by a dentist or an oral surgeon.  In these patients, dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition.  Discontinuation of treatment should be considered based on benefit-risk assessment.', '2', '"Product Information.

The myopathy may be dose-related and is characterized by muscle aches and/or weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values exceeding 10 times the upper limit of normal.  Therapy with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors should be administered cautiously in patients with preexisting myopathy, in those with predisposing factors for myopathy or with a history of myoneural disorder, since it may delay the recognition or confound the diagnosis of a drug-induced musculoskeletal effect.  Patients should be advised to report promptly any unusual muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.  Periodic CPK determinations may be considered in some patients, although the value of such monitoring is uncertain.
