Effect: Foods that contain large amounts of tyramine may precipitate a hypertensive crisis in patients treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).  The mechanism is inhibition of MAO-A, the enzyme responsible for metabolizing exogenous amines such as tyramine in the gut and preventing them from being absorbed intact.  Once absorbed, tyramine is metabolized to octopamine, a substance that is believed to displace norepinephrine from storage granules.

Management: In general, patients treated with MAOIs or other agents that possess MAOI activity (e.g., furazolidone, linezolid, procarbazine) should avoid consumption of products that contain large amounts of amines and protein foods in which aging or breakdown of protein is used to increase flavor.  These foods include cheese (particularly strong, aged or processed cheeses), sour cream, wine (particularly red wine), champagne, beer, pickled herring, anchovies, caviar, shrimp paste, liver (particularly chicken liver), dry sausage, salamis, figs, raisins, bananas, avocados, chocolate, soy sauce, bean curd, sauerkraut, yogurt, papaya products, meat tenderizers, fava bean pods, protein extracts, yeast extracts, and dietary supplements.  Caffeine may also precipitate hypertensive crisis so its intake should be minimized as well.  At least 14 days should elapse following discontinuation of MAOI therapy before these foods may be consumed.  Specially designed reference materials and dietary consultation are recommended so that an appropriate and safe diet can be planned.  Patients should be advised to promptly seek medical attention if they experience potential signs and symptoms of a hypertensive crisis such as severe headache, visual disturbances, difficulty thinking, stupor or coma, seizures, chest pain, unexplained nausea or vomiting, and stroke-like symptoms.

Effect: Alcohol may cause hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes.  Hypoglycemia most frequently occurs during acute consumption of alcohol.  Even modest amounts can lower blood sugar significantly, especially when the alcohol is ingested on an empty stomach or following exercise.  The mechanism involves inhibition of both gluconeogenesis as well as the counter-regulatory response to hypoglycemia.  Episodes of hypoglycemia may last for 8 to 12 hours after ethanol ingestion.  By contrast, chronic alcohol abuse can cause impaired glucose tolerance and hyperglycemia.  Moderate alcohol consumption generally does not affect blood glucose levels in patients with well controlled diabetes.  A disulfiram-like reaction (e.g., flushing, headache, and nausea) to alcohol has been reported frequently with the use of chlorpropamide and very rarely with other sulfonylureas.

Management: Patients with diabetes should avoid consuming alcohol if their blood glucose is not well controlled, or if they have hypertriglyceridemia, neuropathy, or pancreatitis.  Patients with well controlled diabetes should limit their alcohol intake to one drink daily for women and two drinks daily for men (1 drink = 5 oz wine, 12 oz beer, or 1.5 oz distilled spirits) in conjunction with their normal meal plan.

Effect: Alcohol can potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism and increase the risk of lactic acidosis.  In addition, alcohol may cause hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes.  Although hypoglycemia rarely occurs during treatment with metformin alone, the risk may increase with acute consumption of alcohol.  Even modest amounts can lower blood sugar significantly, especially when the alcohol is ingested on an empty stomach or following exercise.  The mechanism involves inhibition of both gluconeogenesis as well as the counter-regulatory response to hypoglycemia.

Management: Metformin should be taken with meals, and excessive alcohol intake should be avoided during treatment.  Diabetes patients in general should avoid consuming alcohol if their blood glucose is not well controlled, or if they have hypertriglyceridemia, neuropathy, or pancreatitis.  Alcohol should not be consumed on an empty stomach or following exercise, as it may increase the risk of hypoglycemia.  Patients should contact their physician immediately if they experience potential signs and symptoms of lactic acidosis such as malaise, myalgia, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress (especially after stabilization of metformin therapy, when gastrointestinal symptoms are uncommon).  With more marked acidosis, there may also be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias.  Metformin should be withdrawn promptly if lactic acidosis is suspected.  Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, blood pH, lactate levels, and blood metformin levels may be useful in establishing a diagnosis.  Lactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).', 'DDInter', 0, NULL);

Effect: Grapefruit juice may increase the plasma concentrations of orally administered drugs that are substrates of the CYP450 3A4 isoenzyme.  The proposed mechanism is inhibition of CYP450 3A4-mediated first-pass metabolism in the gut wall by certain compounds present in grapefruit.  Because grapefruit juice inhibits primarily intestinal rather than hepatic CYP450 3A4, the magnitude of interaction is greatest for those drugs that undergo significant presystemic metabolism by CYP450 3A4 (i.e., drugs with low oral bioavailability).  In general, the effect of grapefruit juice is concentration-, dose- and preparation-dependent, and can vary widely among brands.  Certain preparations of grapefruit juice (e.g., high dose, double strength) have sometimes demonstrated potent inhibition of CYP450 3A4, while other preparations (e.g., low dose, single strength) have typically demonstrated moderate inhibition.  Pharmacokinetic interactions involving grapefruit juice are also subject to a high degree of interpatient variability, thus the extent to which a given patient may be affected is difficult to predict.

Effect: Alcohol may cause hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes.  Hypoglycemia most frequently occurs during acute consumption of alcohol.  Even modest amounts can lower blood sugar significantly, especially when the alcohol is ingested on an empty stomach or following exercise.  The mechanism involves inhibition of both gluconeogenesis as well as the counter-regulatory response to hypoglycemia.  Episodes of hypoglycemia may last for 8 to 12 hours after ethanol ingestion.  By contrast, chronic alcohol abuse can cause impaired glucose tolerance and hyperglycemia.  Moderate alcohol consumption generally does not affect blood glucose levels in patients with well controlled diabetes.

Management: Patients with diabetes should avoid consuming alcohol if their blood glucose is not well controlled, or if they have hypertriglyceridemia, neuropathy, or pancreatitis.  Patients with well controlled diabetes should limit their alcohol intake to one drink daily for women and two drinks daily for men (1 drink = 5 oz wine, 12 oz beer, or 1.5 oz distilled spirits) in conjunction with their normal meal plan.

Grapefruit juice caused more than twofold increases in felodipine, nifedipine, and nisoldipine AUCs.

Management: The manufacturers of nifedipine and nisoldipine recommend avoiding grapefruit juice.  Patients treated orally with other calcium channel blockers should be advised to avoid consumption of large amounts of grapefruits and grapefruit juice to prevent any undue fluctuations in serum drug levels.  Increased effects on blood pressure may persist for up to 4 days after the consumption of grapefruit juice.  Monitoring for calcium channel blocker adverse effects (e.g., headache, hypotension, syncope, tachycardia, edema) is recommended.', 'DDInter', 0, NULL);

Severity: Moderate

Effect: Grapefruit juice may increase the plasma concentrations of orally administered drugs that are substrates of the CYP450 3A4 isoenzyme.  The proposed mechanism is inhibition of CYP450 3A4-mediated first-pass metabolism in the gut wall by certain compounds present in grapefruit.  Because grapefruit juice inhibits primarily intestinal rather than hepatic CYP450 3A4, the magnitude of interaction is greatest for those drugs that undergo significant presystemic metabolism by CYP450 3A4 (i.e., drugs with low oral bioavailability).  In general, the effect of grapefruit juice is concentration-, dose- and preparation-dependent, and can vary widely among brands.  Certain preparations of grapefruit juice (e.g., high dose, double strength) have sometimes demonstrated potent inhibition of CYP450 3A4, while other preparations (e.g., low dose, single strength) have typically demonstrated moderate inhibition.  Pharmacokinetic interactions involving grapefruit juice are also subject to a high degree of interpatient variability, thus the extent to which a given patient may be affected is difficult to predict.

Management: Patients who regularly consume grapefruit or grapefruit juice should be monitored for adverse effects and altered plasma concentrations of drugs that undergo significant presystemic metabolism by CYP450 3A4.

Effect: Foods that contain large amounts of tyramine may precipitate a hypertensive crisis in patients treated with ozanimod.  The mechanism is inhibition of monoamine oxidase type A (MAO-A) by metabolites of ozanimod.  MAO-A is the enzyme responsible for metabolizing exogenous amines such as tyramine in the gut and preventing them from being absorbed intact.  Once absorbed, tyramine is metabolized to octopamine, a substance that is believed to displace norepinephrine from storage granules.

Management: In general, patients treated with ozanimod should avoid consumption of products that contain large amounts of amines (e.g., tyramine) and protein foods in which ageing or breakdown of protein is used to increase flavor.  These foods include cheese (particularly strong, aged or processed cheeses), sour cream, wine (particularly red wine), champagne, beer, pickled herring, anchovies, caviar, shrimp paste, liver (particularly chicken liver), dry sausage, salamis, figs, raisins, bananas, avocados, chocolate, soy sauce, bean curd, sauerkraut, yogurt, papaya products, meat tenderizers, fava bean pods, protein extracts, yeast extracts, and dietary supplements.

Effect: Concomitant use of asparaginase with other hepatotoxic agents may potentiate the risk of liver injury.  Asparaginase-associated hepatotoxicity has been reported more commonly in adults than in children and has been strongly associated with obesity.  Hepatomegaly, acute severe hepatotoxicity, and fatal liver failure have been reported with asparaginase treatment in adults.  Also, asparaginase may increase the toxicity of drugs bound to plasma proteins or metabolized by the liver.  

Management: The risk of additive hepatotoxicity should be considered when asparaginase is used with other hepatotoxic agents (e.g., alcohol, androgens, antituberculosis agents, azole antifungal agents, ACE inhibitors, macrolide antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, sulfonamides, thiazolidinediones, and statins).  Liver function tests should be monitored at regular intervals during asparaginase treatment with or without other hepatotoxic drugs.

Effect: Alcohol may cause hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes.  Hypoglycemia most frequently occurs during acute consumption of alcohol.  Even modest amounts can lower blood sugar significantly, especially when the alcohol is ingested on an empty stomach or following exercise.  The mechanism involves inhibition of both gluconeogenesis as well as the counter-regulatory response to hypoglycemia.  Episodes of hypoglycemia may last for 8 to 12 hours after ethanol ingestion.

Effect: Alcohol may cause hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes.  Hypoglycemia most frequently occurs during acute consumption of alcohol.  Even modest amounts can lower blood sugar significantly, especially when the alcohol is ingested on an empty stomach or following exercise.  The mechanism involves inhibition of both gluconeogenesis as well as the counter-regulatory response to hypoglycemia.  Episodes of hypoglycemia may last for 8 to 12 hours after ethanol ingestion.  By contrast, chronic alcohol abuse can cause impaired glucose tolerance and hyperglycemia.  Moderate alcohol consumption generally does not affect blood glucose levels in patients with well controlled diabetes.  A disulfiram-like reaction (e.g., flushing, headache, and nausea) to alcohol has been reported frequently with the use of chlorpropamide and very rarely with other sulfonylureas.

Management: Patients with diabetes should avoid consuming alcohol if their blood glucose is not well controlled, or if they have hypertriglyceridemia, neuropathy, or pancreatitis.  Patients with well controlled diabetes should limit their alcohol intake to one drink daily for women and two drinks daily for men (1 drink = 5 oz wine, 12 oz beer, or 1.5 oz distilled spirits) in conjunction with their normal meal plan.

Effect: Foods that contain large amounts of tyramine may precipitate a hypertensive crisis in patients treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).  The mechanism is inhibition of MAO-A, the enzyme responsible for metabolizing exogenous amines such as tyramine in the gut and preventing them from being absorbed intact.  Once absorbed, tyramine is metabolized to octopamine, a substance that is believed to displace norepinephrine from storage granules.

Management: In general, patients treated with MAOIs or other agents that possess MAOI activity (e.g., furazolidone, linezolid, procarbazine) should avoid consumption of products that contain large amounts of amines and protein foods in which aging or breakdown of protein is used to increase flavor.  These foods include cheese (particularly strong, aged or processed cheeses), sour cream, wine (particularly red wine), champagne, beer, pickled herring, anchovies, caviar, shrimp paste, liver (particularly chicken liver), dry sausage, salamis, figs, raisins, bananas, avocados, chocolate, soy sauce, bean curd, sauerkraut, yogurt, papaya products, meat tenderizers, fava bean pods, protein extracts, yeast extracts, and dietary supplements.  Caffeine may also precipitate hypertensive crisis so its intake should be minimized as well.  At least 14 days should elapse following discontinuation of MAOI therapy before these foods may be consumed.  Specially designed reference materials and dietary consultation are recommended so that an appropriate and safe diet can be planned.

Effect: Coadministration with grapefruit juice does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of quinine in a clinically relevant manner.  Although grapefruit juice is an inhibitor of CYP450 3A4 and quinine is metabolized by this pathway to its major metabolite, 3-hydroxyquinine, a study of ten healthy volunteers found no significant differences in quinine peak plasma concentration (Cmax), time to reach Cmax (Tmax), terminal elimination half-life, systemic exposure (AUC), or apparent oral clearance (Cl/F) when a single 600 mg oral dose of quinine sulfate was administered in combination with 200 mL of orange juice (control), half-strength grapefruit juice, and full-strength grapefruit juice twice daily for 6 days each, separated by a 2-week washout period.  Relative to the control period, the apparent renal clearance of quinine was markedly increased by 81% during treatment with half-strength grapefruit juice.  However, since renal clearance accounts for approximately 6% of the total clearance of quinine, this change would likely have minimal clinical impact.  The lack of a significant interaction is probably due to the fact that grapefruit juice primarily inhibits intestinal rather than hepatic CYP450 3A4, and quinine is not known to undergo significant presystemic metabolism as evidenced by its relatively high oral bioavailability (76% to 88%).  Nevertheless, excessive consumption of grapefruit juice and tonic water (which contains quinine) was suspected as the cause of torsade de pointes arrhythmia in a patient with a history of asymptomatic long QT syndrome.

The proposed mechanism is inhibition of CYP450 3A4-mediated first-pass metabolism in the gut wall by certain compounds present in grapefruit.  Because ranolazine prolongs QT interval in a dose-dependent manner, high plasma levels of ranolazine may increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and torsade de pointes.

Management: Patients treated with ranolazine should avoid consumption of grapefruit juice and other grapefruit products if possible.  Otherwise, the dosage of ranolazine should be limited to 500 mg twice a day.', 'DDInter', 0, NULL);

Severity: Moderate

Effect: Foods that contain large amounts of tyramine may precipitate a hypertensive crisis in patients treated with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors.  The mechanism involves inhibition of MAO-A, the enzyme responsible for metabolizing exogenous amines such as tyramine in the gut and preventing them from being absorbed intact.  Once absorbed, tyramine is metabolized to octopamine, a substance that is believed to displace norepinephrine from storage granules.

Management: Dietary restriction is not ordinarily required during rasagiline treatment with respect to most foods and beverages that may contain tyramine such as air-dried and fermented meats or fish, aged cheeses, most soybean products, yeast extracts, red wine, beer, and sauerkraut.  However, certain foods like some of the aged cheeses (e.g., Boursault, Liederkrantz, Mycella, Stilton) may contain very high amounts of tyramine and could potentially cause a hypertensive reaction in patients taking rasagiline even at recommended dosages due to increased sensitivity to tyramine.  Patients should be advised to avoid ingesting very high levels of tyramine (e.g., greater than 150 mg), and to promptly seek medical attention if they experience potential signs and symptoms of a hypertensive crisis such as severe headache, visual disturbances, confusion, stupor or coma, seizures, chest pain, unexplained nausea or vomiting, and stroke-like symptoms.  Rasagiline should not be used at dosages exceeding 1 mg/day (0.5 mg/day for patients with mild hepatic impairment or concomitant use of ciprofloxacin or other CYP450 1A2 inhibitors), as it can increase the risk of hypertensive crisis and other adverse reactions associated with nonselective inhibition of MAO.

Effect: Alcohol may cause hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes.  Hypoglycemia most frequently occurs during acute consumption of alcohol.  Even modest amounts can lower blood sugar significantly, especially when the alcohol is ingested on an empty stomach or following exercise.  The mechanism involves inhibition of both gluconeogenesis as well as the counter-regulatory response to hypoglycemia.

Management: Patients with diabetes should avoid consuming alcohol if their blood glucose is not well controlled, or if they have hypertriglyceridemia, neuropathy, or pancreatitis.  Patients with well controlled diabetes should limit their alcohol intake to one drink daily for women and two drinks daily for men (1 drink = 5 oz wine, 12 oz beer, or 1.5 oz distilled spirits) in conjunction with their normal meal plan.

Severity: Major

Effect: Foods that contain large amounts of tyramine may precipitate a hypertensive crisis in patients treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).  The mechanism is inhibition of MAO-A, the enzyme responsible for metabolizing exogenous amines such as tyramine in the gut and preventing them from being absorbed intact.  Once absorbed, tyramine is metabolized to octopamine, a substance that is believed to displace norepinephrine from storage granules.  Although selegiline is considered a selective inhibitor of MAO-B, the selectivity may not be absolute even at recommended dosages.

Management: Patients treated with oral selegiline and transdermal selegiline (greater than 6 mg/24 hour) should preferably avoid consumption of products that contain large amounts of amines and protein foods in which aging or breakdown of protein is used to increase flavor.  These foods include cheese (particularly strong, aged or processed cheeses), sour cream, wine (particularly red wine), champagne, beer, pickled herring, anchovies, caviar, shrimp paste, liver (particularly chicken liver), dry sausage, salamis, figs, raisins, bananas, avocados, chocolate, soy sauce, bean curd, sauerkraut, yogurt, papaya products, meat tenderizers, fava bean pods, protein extracts, yeast extracts, and dietary supplements.  Caffeine may also precipitate hypertensive crisis so its intake should be minimized as well.  At least 14 days should elapse following discontinuation of selegiline therapy before these foods may be consumed.  Specially designed reference materials and dietary consultation are recommended so that an appropriate and safe diet can be planned.  Patients should also be advised to promptly seek medical attention if they experience potential signs and symptoms of a hypertensive crisis such as severe headache, visual disturbances, difficulty thinking, stupor or coma, seizures, chest pain, unexplained nausea or vomiting, and stroke-like symptoms.

Effect: Food may delay the gastrointestinal absorption of tamsulosin.  The time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) is reached by 4 to 5 hours under fasted conditions and by 6 to 7 hours when tamsulosin is administered with food.  The delay in Tmax has the desirable effect of smoothing the tamsulosin plasma concentration profile, thereby reducing fluctuation of the plasma peak and trough concentrations with multiple dosing.  Food may also affect the extent of absorption of tamsulosin.  It has been reported that taking tamsulosin under fasted conditions results in a 30% increase in bioavailability (AUC) and 40% to 70% increase in peak plasma concentration (Cmax) compared to fed conditions.  The effects of food on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin are consistent regardless of whether tamsulosin is taken with a light meal or a high-fat meal.

Effect: The recent, concomitant, or subsequent use (without the recommended leflunomide washout period or procedure) of other agents known to induce hepatotoxicity may potentiate the risk of liver injury associated with leflunomide.  The risk is thought to extend to teriflunomide, its principal active metabolite, because recommended dosages of both result in a similar range of plasma concentrations of teriflunomide.  Elevated liver transaminases, hepatitis, jaundice/cholestasis, hepatic failure, and acute hepatic necrosis have been reported with the use of leflunomide.  Liver enzyme elevations were generally mild (2 times the upper limit of normal or less) and resolved while continuing treatment.  Marked elevations (greater than 3-fold ULN) occurred infrequently and reversed with dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment in most cases.

Liver enzymes and bilirubin should be measured prior to initiation of leflunomide/teriflunomide therapy and at least monthly for the first six months of treatment and every 6 to 8 weeks thereafter.  Patients with preexisting liver disease or elevated baseline liver enzymes (i.e., ALT greater than two times ULN) should not receive leflunomide or teriflunomide.  Patients who develop elevated serum ALT greater than three times ULN while receiving these medications should discontinue treatment and be given washout procedures with cholestyramine or activated charcoal to accelerate elimination of leflunomide''s active metabolite from plasma, which otherwise may take up to two years.

In addition, tizanidine and many of these agents (e.g., alcohol, anxiolytics, sedatives, hypnotics, antidepressants, antipsychotics, opioids, muscle relaxants) also can exhibit hypotensive effects, which may be additive during coadministration and may increase the risk of symptomatic hypotension and orthostasis, particularly during initiation of therapy or dose escalation.

Management: Caution is advised and more gradual dose titration may be appropriate when tizanidine is used with other substances that can cause CNS depression and/or hypotension, particularly in elderly or debilitated patients.  Ambulatory patients should be counseled to avoid hazardous activities requiring complete mental alertness and motor coordination until they know how these agents affect them, and to avoid rising abruptly from a sitting or recumbent position.

Effect: Alcohol may cause hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes.  Hypoglycemia most frequently occurs during acute consumption of alcohol.  Even modest amounts can lower blood sugar significantly, especially when the alcohol is ingested on an empty stomach or following exercise.  The mechanism involves inhibition of both gluconeogenesis as well as the counter-regulatory response to hypoglycemia.  Episodes of hypoglycemia may last for 8 to 12 hours after ethanol ingestion.  By contrast, chronic alcohol abuse can cause impaired glucose tolerance and hyperglycemia.  Moderate alcohol consumption generally does not affect blood glucose levels in patients with well controlled diabetes.  A disulfiram-like reaction (e.g., flushing, headache, and nausea) to alcohol has been reported frequently with the use of chlorpropamide and very rarely with other sulfonylureas.

Management: Patients with diabetes should avoid consuming alcohol if their blood glucose is not well controlled, or if they have hypertriglyceridemia, neuropathy, or pancreatitis.  Patients with well controlled diabetes should limit their alcohol intake to one drink daily for women and two drinks daily for men (1 drink = 5 oz wine, 12 oz beer, or 1.5 oz distilled spirits) in conjunction with their normal meal plan.

Effect: Foods that contain large amounts of tyramine may precipitate a hypertensive crisis in patients treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).  The mechanism is inhibition of MAO-A, the enzyme responsible for metabolizing exogenous amines such as tyramine in the gut and preventing them from being absorbed intact.  Once absorbed, tyramine is metabolized to octopamine, a substance that is believed to displace norepinephrine from storage granules.

Management: In general, patients treated with MAOIs or other agents that possess MAOI activity (e.g., furazolidone, linezolid, procarbazine) should avoid consumption of products that contain large amounts of amines and protein foods in which aging or breakdown of protein is used to increase flavor.  These foods include cheese (particularly strong, aged or processed cheeses), sour cream, wine (particularly red wine), champagne, beer, pickled herring, anchovies, caviar, shrimp paste, liver (particularly chicken liver), dry sausage, salamis, figs, raisins, bananas, avocados, chocolate, soy sauce, bean curd, sauerkraut, yogurt, papaya products, meat tenderizers, fava bean pods, protein extracts, yeast extracts, and dietary supplements.  Caffeine may also precipitate hypertensive crisis so its intake should be minimized as well.  At least 14 days should elapse following discontinuation of MAOI therapy before these foods may be consumed.  Specially designed reference materials and dietary consultation are recommended so that an appropriate and safe diet can be planned.

Severity: Moderate

Effect: Vitamin K may antagonize the hypoprothrombinemic effect of oral anticoagulants.  Vitamin K is a cofactor in the synthesis of blood clotting factors that are inhibited by oral anticoagulants, thus intake of vitamin K through supplements or diet can reverse the action of oral anticoagulants.  Resistance to oral anticoagulants has been associated with consumption of foods or enteral feedings high in vitamin K content.  Likewise, a reduction of vitamin K intake following stabilization of anticoagulant therapy may result in elevation of the INR and bleeding complications.  Foods rich in vitamin K include beef liver, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, collard greens, endive, kale, lettuce, mustard greens, parsley, soy beans, spinach, Swiss chard, turnip greens, watercress, and other green leafy vegetables.  Moderate to high levels of vitamin K are also found in other foods such as asparagus, avocados, dill pickles, green peas, green tea, canola oil, margarine, mayonnaise, olive oil, and soybean oil.  Snack foods containing the fat substitute, olestra, are fortified with 80 mcg of vitamin K per each one ounce serving so as to offset any depletion of vitamin K that may occur due to olestra interference with its absorption.  Whether these foods can alter the effect of oral anticoagulants has not been extensively studied.  One small study found that moderate consumption (1.5 servings/day) does not significantly affect the INR after one week in patients receiving long-term anticoagulation.

Management: Intake of vitamin K through supplements or diet should not vary significantly during oral anticoagulant therapy.  The diet in general should remain consistent, as other foods containing little or no vitamin K such as mangos and soy milk have been reported to interact with warfarin.  Some experts recommend that continuous enteral nutrition should be interrupted for one hour before and one hour after administration of the anticoagulant dose and that enteral formulas containing soy protein should be avoided.

Effect: Concomitant use of asparaginase with other hepatotoxic agents may potentiate the risk of liver injury.  Asparaginase-associated hepatotoxicity has been reported more commonly in adults than in children and has been strongly associated with obesity.  Hepatomegaly, acute severe hepatotoxicity, and fatal liver failure have been reported with asparaginase treatment in adults.  Also, asparaginase may increase the toxicity of drugs bound to plasma proteins or metabolized by the liver.

Management: The risk of additive hepatotoxicity should be considered when asparaginase is used with other hepatotoxic agents (e.g., alcohol, androgens, antituberculosis agents, azole antifungal agents, ACE inhibitors, macrolide antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, sulfonamides, thiazolidinediones, and statins).  Liver function tests should be monitored at regular intervals during asparaginase treatment with or without other hepatotoxic drugs.  Patients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience potential symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as right upper quadrant pain, increasing abdominal size, fever, rash, itching, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, malaise, dark urine, pale stools, and jaundice.', 'DDInter', 0, NULL);

Effect: Concomitant use of buprenorphine with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., nonbenzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol) may increase the risk of buprenorphine overdose, severe respiratory depression, coma, and death.  Reported cases have primarily occurred in the setting of buprenorphine maintenance treatment for opiate addiction, and many, but not all, involved abuse or misuse of buprenorphine including intravenous self-injection.  The mechanism of interaction probably involves some degree of additive pharmacologic effects.  Preclinical studies also suggest that benzodiazepines can alter the usual ceiling effect on buprenorphine-induced respiratory depression and render the respiratory effects of buprenorphine appear similar to those of full opioid agonists.  Coadministration of buprenorphine with some CNS depressants such as alcohol, benzodiazepines, and phenothiazines may also increase the risk of hypotension.

Management: The use of opioids in conjunction with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants should generally be avoided unless alternative treatment options are inadequate.  If coadministration is necessary, the dosage and duration of each drug should be limited to the minimum required to achieve desired clinical effect.  Patients should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation, and advised to avoid driving or operating hazardous machinery until they know how these medications affect them.  Extreme caution is advised when prescribing buprenorphine to patients who are addicted to opioids and also abusing benzodiazepines or alcohol.  Due to potential risk of overdose and death, dependence on sedative-hypnotics such as benzodiazepines or alcohol is considered a relative contraindication for office-based buprenorphine treatment of opioid addiction.  For patients who have been receiving extended therapy with both an opioid and a benzodiazepine and require discontinuation of either medication, a gradual tapering of dose is advised, since abrupt withdrawal may lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Severe cases of benzodiazepine withdrawal, primarily in patients who have received excessive doses over a prolonged period, may result in numbness and tingling of extremities, hypersensitivity to light and noise, hallucinations, and epileptic seizures.', 'DDInter', 0, NULL);
