    "indications": "The American Academy of Family Physicians lists patients with shellfish allergy, diagnosis of asthma, or use of diabetes medications or warfarin as “C” evidence contraindications (supported by consensus, disease-oriented evidence, usual practice, expert opinion, or case series). Although not prohibitive to glucosamine sulfate use, patients with one or more of these criteria should be monitored cautiously for potential adverse effects.\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]",
    "mechanism": "Researchers have not identified the mechanisms of action for glucosamine sulfate in vivo, despite being the focus of various studies. However, what does seem certain is that glucosamine sulfate shows notable bioavailability following oral administration and decreased clearance compared to alternative formulations of glucosamine supplements such as glucosamine hydrochloride.\n[9]\nIn light of this known bioavailability, the theorized therapeutic benefits of orally administered, exogenous glucosamine sulfate supplements are based on the hypothesized functions of endogenous glucosamine. Glucosamine is a naturally occurring amino sugar that serves as a fundamental building block of glycosaminoglycans, one of the structural components found in cartilage and other connective tissues. Glycosaminoglycans are key contributors to cartilaginous properties, such as elasticity, strength, and flexibility.\n[10]\n[11]\n\nThe theorized mechanism of action of glucosamine, and thus, glucosamine sulfate, is largely based on in vitro studies analyzing its interaction with cell types found in the joint space. The proposed mechanism of action of glucosamine sulfate is thus two-fold. First, the theory is that glucosamine sulfate stimulates the synthesis of glycosaminoglycans and augments type II collagen expression in chondrocytes. Secondly, it is believed that glucosamine sulfate prevents glycosaminoglycan and collagen degradation by down-regulating the production of inflammatory cytokines via decreased prostaglandin E2 synthesis, inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB), and decreased expression of catabolic enzymes such as metalloproteinases (MPs).\n[11]\n[12]\n\nThe mechanism of action of glucosamine sulfate is often discussed in reference to the derangements in joint pathophysiology seen in osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis characteristically manifests an imbalance between the synthesis of structural proteins of articular cartilage such as proteoglycans and collagen and their degradation by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).  In patients affected by this disease, chondrocytes can become activated to release pro-inflammatory cytokines due to environmental stress.\n[13]\nDue to these postulated effects on cartilage turnover processes, the hypothesis is that glucosamine sulfate may serve a role in managing osteoarthritis.",
    "administration": "Glucosamine sulfate may be taken in tablet or capsule form. Due to a lack of FDA approval, there is no validated effective dose.  However, glucosamine sulfate is typically taken as a 500 mg dose three times a day for those taking it as a desired osteoarthritis intervention.\n[14]",
    "adverse_effects": "Glucosamine has no serious adverse effects, but possible complications include\n[14]\n:\n\nEpigastric pain\nHeartburn\nDiarrhea\nNausea\n\nThere have been no proven drug interactions. There was previously a theory that glucosamine sulfate might interfere with the effectiveness of diabetes medications; however, research has since refuted this concept.\n[10]\n\nThere was also a report of one case study that glucosamine sulfate appeared to exert some effect on the efficacy of warfarin when taken in combination; however, further studies are needed to validate this finding.",
    "monitoring": "Prescribers should initially start patients on a closely monitored 60-day trial to ensure tolerability and screen for adverse side effects. For pharmacologically treated diabetic patients wishing to start glucosamine sulfate supplementation, the Arthritis Foundation recommends an increase in the frequency of blood glucose monitoring due to the theoretical risk of hyperglycemia.\n[14]",
    "toxicity": "Through various studies, Glucosamine sulfate has consistently been concluded to be a relatively safe oral supplement. A few isolated case studies have reported on the incidence of hepatotoxicity following >3 weeks of glucosamine sulfate use. However, all patients cited had severe preexisting liver disease, with one of the eight patients mentioned developing hepatic failure.\n[17]"
