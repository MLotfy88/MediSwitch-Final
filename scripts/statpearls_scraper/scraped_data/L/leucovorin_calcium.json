    "clinical_significance": "Legal issues within the specialty of EMS are challenging, requiring the EMS medical director to be keenly aware of pitfalls in the practice of the specialty. Whereas previous EMS medical directors have enjoyed immunity from litigation, the legal profession is becoming aware of the role of the EMS medical director as more and more board-certified EMS physicians enter the practice. The EMS medical director needs to understand their liabilities and the protections and areas where they draw their authority as it varies from state to state. Despite the largely uncharted legal territory, the EMS medical director enjoys the unique opportunity to care for patients across the community in a constantly evolving specialty."
