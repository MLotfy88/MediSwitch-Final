tml # MediSwitch Project - AI Handover Checkpoint

**Objective:** Continue development of the MediSwitch mobile application (Flutter) and its supporting backend (Django).

**Core Project Documents:**

1.  **`@/app_prompt.md`**: Contains the **overall project vision, features, UI/UX guidelines, technical requirements, and monetization strategy**. Defines *what* needs to be built. **Study this VERY carefully.**
2.  **`@/mediswitch_plan.md`**: Contains a **detailed, phased implementation plan** with specific tasks. Defines *how* the project should be built and tracks progress. **Refer to this constantly and adhere strictly to determine the next step.**
3.  **`@/env.md`**: Details the **development environment setup** (versions, paths). **Ensure your environment is compatible.**

**Instructions for Continuing Development:**

1.  **Understand the Current State:**
    a.  **Initial Full Scan:** Before proceeding, **read ALL files** in the workspace to get a complete overview.
    b.  **Analyze Structure & Code:** Thoroughly examine the entire project structure (frontend and backend) and analyze existing code.
    c.  **Visualize Structure:** Draw or mentally map out the project's component structure and data flow.
    d.  **Study Core Documents:** **VERY CAREFULLY** review the core documents (`app_prompt.md`, `mediswitch_plan.md`, `env.md`) to fully understand the goals, plan, status, and environment.
2.  **Follow the Plan:** Adhere **strictly** to the `@/mediswitch_plan.md`. Identify the next incomplete task (`[ ]` or `[~]`) in the logical sequence based on your analysis and implement it step-by-step.
3.  **Adopt the Methodology:** Follow the established development methodology:
    *   **Analyze:** Understand the task requirements from the plan and prompt.
    *   **Plan:** Break down the task into smaller, manageable steps. Use available tools (`read_file`, `list_files`, etc.) to gather necessary context before modifying code.
    *   **Implement:** Use the appropriate tools (`write_to_file`, `apply_diff`, `execute_command`) one step at a time to implement the changes.
    *   **Validate:** After *every* tool use that modifies code or project state, **wait for the result** and meticulously check for any errors (compiler errors, linter warnings, runtime issues reported by the system). **CRITICAL: Do not proceed if errors exist.**
    *   **Fix:** Address and fix all reported errors immediately before moving to the next step.
    *   **Update Plan:** Once a task or sub-task is successfully completed **and verified to be error-free**, immediately update the `@/mediswitch_plan.md` file by changing the corresponding marker to `[x]`.
    *   **Iterate:** Proceed to the next logical task based on the plan.
4.  **Ask Before Deciding:** **Do not make assumptions or decisions.** If a task is ambiguous, requires choosing between options (like library choices, implementation details not specified in the plan), or if you are unsure about the next step, **you MUST ask for clarification** using the `ask_followup_question` tool before proceeding. Follow the user's direction.
5.  **Use Tools Correctly:** Execute file operations, commands, and other actions using the available tools one step at a time, waiting for confirmation after each tool use. Pay close attention to file paths and command syntax. Use `apply_diff` for targeted changes and `write_to_file` for new files or complete rewrites.
6.  **Refer to Core Documents:** Constantly refer back to `@/app_prompt.md` for feature requirements and `@/mediswitch_plan.md` for implementation details and status.
7.  **Maintain Structure & Organization:** **CRITICAL:** Adhere strictly to the established project structure (Clean Architecture) and coding conventions. Work in a methodical, organized manner, avoiding random changes.


**Current Status & Next Steps:**

*   Initial state understanding (Instruction #1) is complete.
*   Core features implemented based on `@/mediswitch_plan.md` and references from `External source` (which has now been commented out/deleted):
    *   **Dose Calculator (Task 3.3):** Implemented service, integrated with provider and UI. (**Deferred for MVP 1.0** - UI shows "Coming Soon").
    *   **Interaction Checker (Task 3.5):** Implemented data loading, analysis service (pairwise), provider integration, and UI display. Refactored related entities and fixed resulting import errors. (**Deferred for MVP 1.0** - UI shows "Coming Soon").
    *   **Settings Screen (Task 3.6):** Implemented theme/language switching and subscription UI placeholder.
    *   **Image Caching (Task 3.2.11):** Added `CachedNetworkImage` dependency, updated `DrugEntity` and `MedicineModel`, updated CSV parsing, and updated `DrugListItem` widget.
    *   **Wi-Fi Debugging Docs (Task 0.2.5):** Created `README.md` with ADB Wi-Fi debugging steps.
    *   **Backend Enhancements (Tasks 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4.1):** Implemented detailed file validation (using pandas), AdMob config endpoint, General config endpoint, and Analytics logging endpoint (including model, serializer, view, URL, migrations).
    *   **UI Refinements:** Implemented basic UI structure for `HomeScreen`, `DrugDetailsScreen`, `SearchScreen`, and `SettingsScreen` based on the HTML/CSS/JS prototype found in `External_source/prototype/`. Refactored `FilterBottomSheet` based on prototype. Fixed related code errors.
*   The code within the `External source` directory has been commented out or deleted as requested. Figma links are now the primary UI reference (though direct access is not possible for the AI).
*   **Reference Design Review (`medi-switch-design-lab-main`):**
    *   The reference design documentation has been reviewed.
    *   The current Flutter implementation matches the reference design by approximately **80-85%**.
    *   Core layouts, colors, primary font (Noto Sans Arabic), icons, and main components are generally aligned.
    *   **Key Deviations:**
        *   CSS-style hover effects are largely unimplemented (expected in Flutter).
        *   Minor differences exist in specific spacing, padding, and fixed-width implementations compared to the design specs.
        *   Some minor UI elements are missing (e.g., "popular" star icon, "alternative" badge, package size info).
        *   The search filter UI is implemented as a `BottomSheet` instead of the specified side sheet.
        *   The secondary font (Roboto) is not actively used.
*   **Recent Fixes & MVP Preparation:**
    *   Fixed `HomeScreen` data loading issue (sections now load automatically). *(Initial fix attempt)*
    *   Fixed `DrugCard` sizing in horizontal lists (`HomeScreen`) by removing fixed height constraints. *(Initial fix attempt)*
    *   Adjusted Settings screen secondary text color for better contrast.
    *   Resolved Home screen state management issue causing data sections to disappear/reappear incorrectly. *(Initial fix attempt)*
    *   Corrected Home screen pagination logic for continuous loading (10 initial, 15 subsequent).
    *   **Resolved persistent Home Screen loading issue:**
        *   Corrected database seeding logic in `SqliteLocalDataSource` to ensure seeding happens when needed and status is reported correctly.
        *   Refactored initialization flow: `InitializationScreen` now directly handles the check for existing data and triggers seeding if necessary, before navigating to `MainScreen`. Removed reliance on `SetupScreen`.
        *   Corrected `MedicineProvider` initialization: Changed registration to `LazySingleton`, fixed initial `_isLoading` state, and removed redundant `await seedingComplete`.
        *   Fixed `HomeScreen` layout: Ensured `HorizontalListSection` receives proper height constraints to render drug cards correctly within the `CustomScrollView`.
    *   Prepared application for **MVP 1.0 Release** according to `@/RELEASE_PLAN.md`:
        *   Confirmed core features (Search, Details, Alternatives, Basic UI, Settings) are functional.
        *   Confirmed AdMob integration (Banner, Interstitial with Test IDs) is present (Task 5.2).
        *   Deferred Dose Calculator (Task 3.3) and Interaction Checker (Task 3.5) features in the UI (buttons show "Coming Soon").
        *   Premium features (Task 5.3) remain deferred.
*   **Next Steps (Towards MVP 1.0 Release):**
    *   Replace AdMob Test IDs with Production IDs.
    *   Perform thorough manual testing (Task 7.1.4).
    *   Consider initial Beta Testing (Task 7.1.5).
    *   Complete release preparation tasks (signing keys, build configurations - Task 7.2).
    *   Deploy the MVP 1.0 release (Task 7.3).
    *   Refer **strictly** to `@/mediswitch_plan.md` and `@/RELEASE_PLAN.md` for detailed task tracking and feature scope.
