Serious infections and sepsis, including fatalities, have been reported with the use of TNF blockers, particularly in patients on concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. Agents that may be significantly myelo- or immunosuppressive include antineoplastic agents, radiation, zidovudine, linezolid, some antirheumatic agents, high dosages of corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic agents, and long-term topical or inhaled corticosteroids. Concomitant use of TNF blockers with other immunosuppressants such as azathioprine or mercaptopurine may also increase the risk of a rare and often fatal cancer of white blood cells known as hepatosplenic T-Cell lymphoma (HSTCL).", "source": "DDInter", "management_text": "Patients receiving a TNF blocker alone or with other immunosuppressive or myelosuppressive agents should be monitored closely for the development of infections.

Serious infections including sepsis, as well as opportunistic infections like Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis, and aspergillosis have been reported with the use of leflunomide, particularly in patients on concomitant hematotoxic therapy.

Rare cases of pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia have also occurred with leflunomide alone, but were most frequent in the presence of concomitant or recent use of methotrexate or other myelotoxic agents. Due to the prolonged elimination half-life of leflunomide's active metabolite, an interaction may occur even when hematotoxic agents are initiated after the discontinuation of leflunomide.

In general, the risk of an individual agent or a combination of agents causing ventricular arrhythmia in association with QT prolongation is largely unpredictable but may be increased by certain underlying risk factors such as congenital long QT syndrome, cardiac disease, and electrolyte disturbances (e.g., hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia).
