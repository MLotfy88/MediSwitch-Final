    "clinical_significance": "The classification of essential and nonessential amino acids was first reported in nutritional studies in the early 1900s. A study by Rose in 1957 found that the human body could stay in nitrogen balance with a diet of only 8 amino acids.\n[15]\nThese 8 amino acids were the initial group classified as essential or indispensable. Subsequent feeding studies with purified amino acids allowed scientists to pinpoint essential amino acids accurately. These studies revealed that removing individual essential amino acids from the diet led to impaired growth or disrupted nitrogen balance in subjects. Further research found that certain amino acids are conditionally essential, depending on the subject's metabolic state. For example, although a healthy adult may synthesize tyrosine from phenylalanine, a young child may not have developed the required enzyme (phenylalanine hydroxylase) to perform this synthesis. Therefore, they would be unable to synthesize tyrosine from phenylalanine, making tyrosine an essential amino acid under those circumstances. This concept also appears in different disease states.\n\nDeviations from the standard metabolic state of a healthy adult may place the body in a metabolic state that requires more than the standard essential amino acids to maintain nitrogen balance. Typically, the optimal ratio of essential and nonessential amino acids requires a balance dependent on physiological requirements that differ between individuals. Finding the optimal ratio of amino acids in total parenteral nutrition for liver or kidney disease is an excellent example of different physiological states requiring different nutrient intakes. Therefore, the terms essential and nonessential amino acids may be misleading as all amino acids may be necessary to ensure optimal health.\n\nClinical symptoms may appear during states of inadequate intake of essential amino acids, such as vomiting or low appetite. These symptoms may include depression, anxiety, insomnia, fatigue, weakness, and growth stunting in the young. These symptoms are mostly caused by a lack of protein synthesis in the body because of the lack of essential amino acids. Adequate amounts of amino acids are necessary to produce neurotransmitters and hormones, muscle growth, and other cellular processes. These deficiencies are typically present in poorer parts of the world or older adults with inadequate care. Alternatively, impaired amino acid metabolism is associated with various human diseases, including phenylketonuria, tyrosinemia, homocystinuria, non-ketotic hyperglycinemia, and maple syrup urine disease.\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n\nKwashiorkor and marasmus are examples of more severe clinical disorders caused by malnutrition and inadequate intake of essential amino acids as a macronutrient. Kwashiorkor is a form of malnutrition characterized by peripheral edema, dry peeling skin with hyperkeratosis and hyperpigmentation, ascites, liver malfunction, immune deficits, anemia, and relatively unchanged muscle protein composition. The diseases result from a diet with insufficient protein but adequate carbohydrates. Marasmus is a form of malnutrition characterized by wasting caused by inadequate protein and caloric intake.\n[22]"
