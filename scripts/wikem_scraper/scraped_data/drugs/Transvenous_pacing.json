    "Procedure": {
      "text": "Site selection: Right IJ or left subclavian for most direct anatomical course\nEquipment:\nExternal generator: Shows rate (bpm), output (mA) and sensitivity\nCordis Kit (7 Fr): Gold strip on kit at Harbor. Contains cordis introducer sheath, TV pacer catheter and pacer wire sheath\nSheath size (internal diameter) should match pacer wire size (external diameter). Otherwise you will get leakage!\nSimilar to a central line, place single lumen catheter under ultrasound guidance.\nPacing catheter\nTest small balloon for leaks prior to insertion with 1.5mL of air while balloon rests in a container of saline\nConnect the positive and negative electrodes to the external generator\nAdvance the catheter through the introducer sheath and into cordis hub to roughly 20 cm (catheter has marked bars indicating 10cm)\nExternal generator: Set HR 80 (or 10 - 20 bpm above patient's native rate), start at max current output (usually 20 mA), and sensitivity all the way down (paces no matter intrinsic rate)\nPearl - Digital generators have \"emergency\" button that goes to automatic settings\nAdvancing Pacing Catheter: Inflate balloon and advance slowly.\nBlind approach: Monitor shows pacer spikes followed by a widened QRS (LBBB appearance)\nUltrasound approach: Have assistant give a subcostal/parasternal long axis, which gives visualization image of when electrode contacts final resting position\nSensing approach: Use alligator clip to connect negative pacer electrode to any precordial lead. Look for ST elevation when RV endocardium engaged.\nFluoroscopy: If time permits, use this method in a patient that has prior pacemaker/ICD. Placement of TV pacer with out fluoro can disrupt prior electrode placements.\nFinal resting position is when pacer wire is in RV apex\nTake note of pacer wire depth in case it is accidentally moved\nIf you overshot your mark (ie IVC/Pulm artery), deflate balloon and pull back. DO NOT PULL INFLATED BALLOON BACKWARD THROUGH A VALVE.\nPearl - IVC pacing leads to coughing/hiccuping and ventilator alarms (ie high frequency)\nDeflate balloon (leave syringe attached) and secure catheter in place\nLock sheath onto cordis hub and then fully extend it & curl around while holding pacer wire in place. Sheath gives sterile amount of wire for any future adjustments if needed.\nAdditional sutures can be placed to stabilize it\nFinal Settings\nOutput: Determine threshold level by reducing electrical current settings until capture lost. Final current set to twice the threshold level for pt\nSensitivity: Adjust level (not too high or too low) so it allows intrinsic beats (unless you are overdrive pacing), but supplements it if needed. You do not want oversensing or undersensing.\nPlacement confirmation\nGood to obtain baseline CXR, which should show the catheter tip over the inferior border of the cardiac shadow\nECG\nshows paced QRS exhibiting a LBBB morphology, and a superior QRS axis",
