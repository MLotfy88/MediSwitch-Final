(2.6) patients with severe renal impairment. (2.7) patients with moderate hepatic impairment. (2.8) 2.1 General Considerations Sacubitril and valsartan tablets are contraindicated with concomitant use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. If switching from an ACE inhibitor to sacubitril and valsartan tablets allow a washout period of 36 hours between administration of the two drugs [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 2.2 Adult Heart Failure The recommended starting dose of sacubitril and valsartan tablets is 49/51 mg orally twice-daily. Double the dose of sacubitril and valsartan tablets after 2 to 4 weeks to the target maintenance dose of 97/103 mg twice daily, as tolerated by the patient. 2.3 Pediatric Heart Failure For the recommended dosage for pediatric patients aged 1 year and older, refer to Table 1 if using the tablets.

Oral Administration The usual total daily dosage of bumetanide is 0.5 to 2 mg and in most patients is given as a single dose. If the diuretic response to an initial dose of bumetanide is not adequate, in view of its rapid onset and short duration of action, a second or third dose may be given at 4- to 5-hour intervals up to a maximum daily dose of 10 mg. An intermittent dose schedule, whereby bumetanide is given on alternate days or for 3 to 4 days with rest periods of 1 to 2 days in between, is recommended as the safest and most effective method for the continued control of edema. In patients with hepatic failure, the dosage should be kept to a minimum, and if necessary, dosage increased very carefully. Because cross-sensitivity with furosemide has rarely been observed, bumetanide can be substituted at approximately a 1:40 ratio of bumetanide to furosemide in patients allergic to furosemide. Parenteral Administration Bumetanide Injection may be administered parenterally (IV or IM) to patients in whom gastrointestinal absorption may be impaired or in whom oral administration is not practical. Parenteral treatment should be terminated and oral treatment instituted as soon as possible."

During initial titration, clomipramine should be given in divided doses with meals to reduce gastrointestinal side effects. The goal of this initial titration phase is to minimize side effects by permitting tolerance to side effects to develop or allowing the patient time to adapt if tolerance does not develop. Because both CMI and its active metabolite, DMI, have long elimination half-lives, the prescriber should take into consideration the fact that steady-state plasma levels may not be achieved until 2 to 3 weeks after dosage change (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Therefore, after initial titration, it may be appropriate to wait 2-3 weeks between further dosage adjustments. Initial Treatment/Dose Adjustment (Adults) Treatment with clomipramine should be initiated at a dosage of 25 mg daily and gradually increased, as tolerated, to approximately 100 mg during the first 2 weeks. During initial titration, clomipramine should be given in divided doses with meals to reduce gastrointestinal side effects. Thereafter, the dosage may be increased gradually over the next several weeks, up to a maximum of 250 mg daily. After titration, the total daily dose may be given once daily at bedtime to minimize daytime sedation. Initial Treatment/Dose Adjustment (Children and Adolescents) As with adults, the starting dose is 25 mg daily and should be gradually increased (also given in divided doses with meals to reduce gastrointestinal side effects) during the first 2 weeks, as tolerated, up to a daily maximum of 3 mg/kg or 100 mg, whichever is smaller. Thereafter, the dosage may be increased gradually over the next several weeks up to a daily maximum of 3 mg/kg or 200 mg, whichever is smaller (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use ).

    "package_label": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dosage must be adjusted according to each patient's needs. Therapy for either hypertension or angina should be initiated with 30 or 60 mg once daily. Nifedipine extended-release tablets should be swallowed whole and should not be bitten or divided. In general, titration should proceed over a 7–14 day period so that the physician can fully assess the response to each dose level and monitor blood pressure before proceeding to higher doses. Since steady-state plasma levels are achieved on the second day of dosing, if symptoms so warrant, titration may proceed more rapidly provided the patient is assessed frequently. Titration to doses above 120 mg are not recommended. Angina patients controlled on nifedipine immediate-release capsules alone or in combination with other antianginal medications may be safely switched to nifedipine extended-release tablets at the nearest equivalent total daily dose (e.g., 30 mg t.i.d. of nifedipine immediate-release capsules may be changed to 90 mg once daily of nifedipine extended-release tablets). Subsequent titration to higher or lower doses may be necessary and should be initiated as clinically warranted. Experience with doses greater than 90 mg in patients with angina is limited. Therefore, doses greater than 90 mg should be used with caution and only when clinically warranted. No \"rebound effect\" has been observed upon discontinuation of nifedipine extended-release tablets. However, if discontinuation of nifedipine is necessary, sound clinical practice suggests that the dosage should be decreased gradually with close physician supervision. Care should be taken when dispensing nifedipine extended-release to assure that the extended release dosage form has been prescribed. Co-Administration with Other Antianginal Drugs Sublingual nitroglycerin may be taken as required for the control of acute manifestations of angina, particularly during nifedipine titration.

The patient’s fasting blood glucose and HbA1c must be measured periodically to determine the minimum effective dose for the patient; to detect primary failure, i.e., inadequate lowering of blood glucose at the maximum recommended dose of medication; and to detect secondary failure, i.e., loss of adequate blood glucose lowering response after an initial period of effectiveness. Glycosylated hemoglobin levels should be performed to monitor the patient’s response to therapy. Short-term administration of glimepiride may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control in patients usually controlled well on diet and exercise. Usual Starting Dose The usual starting dose of glimepiride tablets USP as initial therapy is 1 to 2 mg once daily, administered with breakfast or the first main meal. Those patients who may be more sensitive to hypoglycemic drugs should be started at 1 mg once daily, and should be titrated carefully. (See PRECAUTIONS Section for patients at increased risk.) No exact dosage relationship exists between glimepiride and the other oral hypoglycemic agents. The maximum starting dose of glimepiride tablets USP should be no more than 2 mg. Failure to follow an appropriate dosage regimen may precipitate hypoglycemia. Patients who do not adhere to their prescribed dietary and drug regimen are more prone to exhibit unsatisfactory response to therapy.

Complex Partial Seizures For adults and children 10 years of age or older. Monotherapy (Initial Therapy) Valproic Acid has not been systematically studied as initial therapy. Patients should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day.

The usual starting dose of losartan is 50 mg once daily, with 25 mg recommended for patients with intravascular volume depletion (e.g., patients treated with diuretics) (see WARNINGS, Hypotension — Volume-Depleted Patients) and patients with a history of hepatic impairment (see WARNINGS, Impaired Hepatic Function). Losartan can be administered once or twice daily at total daily doses of 25 to 100 mg. If the antihypertensive effect measured at trough using once-a-day dosing is inadequate, a twice-a-day regimen at the same total daily dose or an increase in dose may give a more satisfactory response. Hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 to 50 mg once daily and can be given at doses of 12.5 to 25 mg as HYZAAR. To minimize dose-independent side effects, it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy. The side effects (see WARNINGS) of losartan are generally rare and apparently independent of dose; those of hydrochlorothiazide are a mixture of dose-dependent (primarily hypokalemia) and dose-independent phenomena (e.g., pancreatitis), the former much more common than the latter. Therapy with any combination of losartan and hydrochlorothiazide will be associated with both sets of dose-independent side effects. Replacement Therapy: The combination may be substituted for the titrated components. Dose Titration by Clinical Effect: A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with losartan monotherapy (see above) or hydrochlorothiazide alone may be switched to HYZAAR 50-12.5 (losartan 50 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) once daily. If blood pressure remains uncontrolled after about 3 weeks of therapy, the dose may be increased to two tablets of HYZAAR 50-12.5 once daily or one tablet of HYZAAR 100-25 (losartan 100 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg) once daily.

Patients with low or absent TPMT activity are at an increased risk of developing severe, life-threatening myelotoxicity from azathioprine tablets if conventional doses are given. Physicians may consider alternative therapies for patients who have low or absent TPMT activity (homozygous for non-functional alleles). Azathioprine tablets should be administered with caution to patients having one non-functional allele (heterozygous) who are at risk for reduced TPMT activity that may lead to toxicity if conventional doses are given. Dosage reduction is recommended in patients with reduced TPMT activity. Early drug discontinuation may be considered in patients with abnormal CBC results that do not respond to dose reduction. Renal Homotransplantation The dose of azathioprine tablets required to prevent rejection and minimize toxicity will vary with individual patients; this necessitates careful management. The initial dose is usually 3 to 5 mg/kg daily, beginning at the time of transplant. Azathioprine tablets are usually given as a single daily dose on the day of, and in a minority of cases 1 to 3 days before, transplantation. Azathioprine is often initiated with the intravenous administration of the sodium salt, with subsequent use of tablets (at the same dose level) after the postoperative period. Intravenous administration of the sodium salt is indicated only in patients unable to tolerate oral medications. Dose reduction to maintenance levels of 1 to 3 mg/kg daily is usually possible.

    "package_label": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Captopril should be taken one hour before meals. Dosage must be individualized. Hypertension Initiation of therapy requires consideration of recent antihypertensive drug treatment, the extent of blood pressure elevation, salt restriction, and other clinical circumstances. If possible, discontinue the patient’s previous antihypertensive drug regimen for one week before starting captopril. The initial dose of captopril is 25 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. If satisfactory reduction of blood pressure has not been achieved after one or two weeks, the dose may be increased to 50 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. Concomitant sodium restriction may be beneficial when captopril is used alone. The dose of captopril in hypertension usually does not exceed 50 mg t.i.d. Therefore, if the blood pressure has not been satisfactorily controlled after one to two weeks at this dose, (and the patient is not already receiving a diuretic), a modest dose of thiazide-type diuretic (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide, 25 mg daily), should be added. The diuretic dose may be increased at one- to two-week intervals until its highest usual antihypertensive dose is reached. If captopril is being started in a patient already receiving a diuretic, captopril therapy should be initiated under close medical supervision (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions regarding hypotension), with dosage and titration of captopril as noted above. If further blood pressure reduction is required, the dose of captopril may be increased to 100 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. and then, if necessary, to 150 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. (while continuing the diuretic). The usual dose range is 25 to 150 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. A maximum daily dose of 450 mg captopril should not be exceeded. For patients with severe hypertension (e.g., accelerated or malignant hypertension), when temporary discontinuation of current antihypertensive therapy is not practical or desirable, or when prompt titration to more normotensive blood pressure levels is in"

Initial Dosage for Adults For outpatients, 75 mg of amitriptyline HCl a day in divided doses is usually satisfactory. If necessary, this may be increased to a total of 150 mg per day. Increases are made preferably in the late afternoon and/or bedtime doses. A sedative effect may be apparent before the antidepressant effect is noted, but an adequate therapeutic effect may take as long as 30 days to develop. An alternate method of initiating therapy in outpatients is to begin with 50 to 100 mg amitriptyline HCl at bedtime. This may be increased by 25 or 50 mg as necessary in the bedtime dose to a total of 150 mg per day. Hospitalized patients may require 100 mg a day initially. This can be increased gradually to 200 mg a day if necessary. A small number of hospitalized patients may need as much as 300 mg a day. Adolescent and Elderly Patients In general, lower dosages are recommended for these patients. Ten mg 3 times a day with 20 mg at bedtime may be satisfactory in adolescent and elderly patients who do not tolerate higher dosages. Maintenance The usual maintenance dosage of amitriptyline HCl is 50 to 100 mg per day. In some patients, 40 mg per day is sufficient. For maintenance therapy, the total daily dosage may be given in a single dose, preferably at bedtime. When satisfactory improvement has been reached, dosage should be reduced to the lowest amount that will maintain relief of symptoms. It is appropriate to continue maintenance therapy 3 months or longer to lessen the possibility of relapse.

Dosing should take place during the daytime hours when the patient needs to be upright, pursuing the activities of daily living. A suggested dosing schedule of approximately 4-hour intervals is as follows: shortly before or upon arising in the morning, midday and late afternoon (not later than 6 P.M.). Doses may be given in 3-hour intervals, if required, to control symptoms, but not more frequently. Single doses as high as 20 mg have been given to patients, but severe and persistent systolic supine hypertension occurs at a high rate (about 45%) at this dose. In order to reduce the potential for supine hypertension during sleep, midodrine hydrochloride tablets should not be given after the evening meal or less than 4 hours before bedtime. Total daily doses greater than 30 mg have been tolerated by some patients, but their safety and usefulness have not been studied systematically or established. Because of the risk of supine hypertension, midodrine hydrochloride tablets should be continued only in patients who appear to attain symptomatic improvement during initial treatment. The supine and standing blood pressure should be monitored regularly and the administration of midodrine hydrochloride tablets should be stopped if supine blood pressure increases excessively. Because desglymidodrine is excreted renally, dosing in patients with abnormal renal function should be cautious; although this has not been systematically studied, it is recommended that treatment of these patients be initiated using 2.5 mg doses. Dosing in children has not been adequately studied. Blood levels of midodrine and desglymidodrine were similar when comparing levels in patients 65 or older vs. younger than 65 and when comparing males vs. females, suggesting dose modifications for these groups are not necessary."

Doses higher than 13.3 mg/24 hours confer no appreciable additional benefit, and are associated with an increase in the incidence of adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1 )].

In general, a loading dose of twice the daily dose is recommended on the first day of therapy to result in plasma concentrations close to steady-state by the second day of therapy. The daily dose of fluconazole for the treatment of infections other than vaginal candidiasis should be based on the infecting organism and the patient’s response to therapy. Treatment should be continued until clinical parameters or laboratory tests indicate that active fungal infection has subsided. An inadequate period of treatment may lead to recurrence of active infection. Patients with AIDS and cryptococcal meningitis or recurrent oropharyngeal candidiasis usually require maintenance therapy to prevent relapse. Oropharyngeal candidiasis: The recommended dosage of fluconazole for oropharyngeal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Clinical evidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis generally resolves within several days, but treatment should be continued for at least 2 weeks to decrease the likelihood of relapse. Esophageal candidiasis: The recommended dosage of fluconazole for esophageal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Doses up to 400 mg/day may be used, based on medical judgment of the patient’s response to therapy. Patients with esophageal candidiasis should be treated for a minimum of three weeks and for at least two weeks following resolution of symptoms.

It is recommended that Theophylline (Anhydrous) Extended-Release Tablets be taken with meals. Patients should be advised that if they choose to take Theophylline (Anhydrous) Extended-Release Tablets with food it should be taken consistently with food and if they take it in a fasted condition it should routinely be taken fasted. It is important that the product whenever dosed be dosed consistently with or without food. Theophylline (Anhydrous) Extended-Release Tablets are not to be chewed or crushed because it may lead to a rapid release of theophylline with the potential for toxicity. The scored tablet may be split. Infrequently, patients receiving Theophylline (Anhydrous) Extended-Release 200 or 300 mg Tablets may pass an intact matrix tablet in the stool or via colostomy. These matrix tablets usually contain little or no residual theophylline. Stabilized patients, 12 years of age or older, who are taking an immediate-release or controlled-release theophylline product may be transferred to once-daily administration of 200 mg or 300 mg Theophylline (Anhydrous) Extended-Release Tablets on a mg-for-mg basis. It must be recognized that the peak and trough serum theophylline levels produced by the once-daily dosing may vary from those produced by the previous product and/or regimen. General Considerations The steady-state peak serum theophylline concentration is a function of the dose, the dosing interval, and the rate of theophylline absorption and clearance in the individual patient. Because of marked individual differences in the rate of theophylline clearance, the dose required to achieve a peak serum theophylline concentration in the 10-20 mcg/mL range varies fourfold among otherwise similar patients in the absence of factors known to alter theophylline clearance (e.g., 400-1600 mg/day in adults <60 years old and 10-36"

For the treatment of gonorrhea in both men and women, a single oral dose of 3.5 grams of ampicillin administered simultaneously with 1 gram of probenecid is recommended. Physicians are cautioned to use no less than the above recommended dosage for the treatment of gonorrhea. Follow-up cultures should be obtained from the original site(s) of infection 7 to 14 days after therapy. In women, it is also desirable to obtain culture test-of-cure from both the endocervical and anal canals. Prolonged intensive therapy is needed for complications such as prostatitis and epididymitis. For respiratory tract infections, the usual dose is 250 mg qid in equally spaced doses. CHILDREN WEIGHING 20 KG OR LESS: For genitourinary or gastrointestinal tract infections, the usual dose is 100 mg/kg/day total, qid in equally divided and spaced doses. For respiratory infections, the usual dose is 50 mg/kg/day total, in equally divided and spaced doses three to four times daily. Doses for children should not exceed doses recommended for adults. ALL PATIENTS, IRRESPECTIVE OF AGE AND WEIGHT: Larger doses may be required for severe or chronic infections. Although ampicillin is resistant to degradation by gastric acid, it should be administered at least one-half hour before or two hours after meals for maximal absorption.

After one week, the dose should be increased to 50 mg once daily. While a relationship between dose and effect has not been established for major depressive disorder, OCD, panic disorder, PTSD or social anxiety disorder, patients were dosed in a range of 50 to 200 mg/day in the clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of sertraline for the treatment of these indications. Consequently, a dose of 50 mg, administered once daily, is recommended as the initial therapeutic dose. Patients not responding to a 50 mg dose may benefit from dose increases up to a maximum of 200 mg/day. Given the 24 hour elimination half-life of sertraline, dose changes should not occur at intervals of less than 1 week. Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder: Sertraline treatment should be initiated with a dose of 50 mg/day, either daily throughout the menstrual cycle or limited to the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, depending on physician assessment.

The dosage of aminoglycosides in obese patients should be based on an estimate of the lean body mass. It is desirable to limit the duration of treatment with aminoglycosides to short term. Patients with Normal Renal Function Adults The recommended dosage of gentamicin injection for patients with serious infections and normal renal function is 3 mg/kg/day, administered in three equal doses every eight hours (Table 1). For patients with life-threatening infections, dosages up to 5 mg/kg/day may be administered in three or four equal doses. This dosage should be reduced to 3 mg/kg/day as soon as clinically indicated (Table 1). It is desirable to measure both peak and trough serum concentrations of gentamicin to determine the adequacy and safety of the dosage. When such measurements are feasible, they should be carried out periodically during therapy to assure adequate but not excessive drug levels. For example, the peak concentration (at 30 to 60 minutes after IM injection) is expected to be in the range of 4 to 6 mcg/mL. When monitoring peak concentrations after IM or IV administration, dosage should be adjusted so that prolonged levels above 12 mcg/mL are avoided. When monitoring trough concentrations (just prior to the next dose), dosage should be adjusted so that levels above 2 mcg/mL are avoided. Determination of the adequacy of a serum level for a particular patient must take into consideration the susceptibility of the causative organism, the severity of the infection and the status of the patient’s host-defense mechanisms. In patients with extensive burns, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. In such patients treated with gentamicin, measurement of serum concentrations is recommended as a basis for dosage adjustment. TABLE 1 DOSAGE SCHEDULE GUIDE FOR "

There is a suggestion, however, based upon order of group mean scores and dose trend analyses of data from these clinical trials, that a daily dose of 10 mg of ARICEPT® might provide additional benefit for some patients. Accordingly, whether or not to employ a dose of 10 mg is a matter of prescriber and patient preference.Evidence from the controlled trials indicates that the 10 mg dose, with a one week titration, is likely to be associated with a higher incidence of cholinergic adverse events than the 5 mg dose. In open label trials using a 6 week titration, the frequency of these same adverse events was similar between the 5 mg and 10 mg dose groups. Therefore, because steady state is not achieved for 15 days and because the incidence of untoward effects may be influenced by the rate of dose escalation, treatment with a dose of 10 mg should not be contemplated until patients have been on a daily dose of 5 mg for 4 to 6 weeks.Each teaspoon (5 mL) of ARICEPT® Oral Solution contains a 5 mg dose. Patients should be instructed as to how to measure their dose of ARICEPT® Oral Solution in teaspoons.ARICEPT® Oral Solution should be taken in the evening, just prior to retiring.ARICEPT® Oral Solution can be taken with or without food."

Initial dosing is generally 2 mg/day. Dose increases should then occur at intervals not less than 24 hours, in increments of 1-2 mg/day, as tolerated, to a recommended dose of 4-8 mg/day. In some patients, slower titration may be appropriate. Efficacy has been demonstrated in a range of 4-16 mg/day [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. However, doses above 6 mg/day for twice daily dosing were not demonstrated to be more efficacious than lower doses, were associated with more extrapyramidal symptoms and other adverse effects, and are generally not recommended. In a single study supporting once-daily dosing, the efficacy results were generally stronger for 8 mg than for 4 mg. The safety of doses above 16 mg/day has not been evaluated in clinical trials. Maintenance Therapy While it is unknown how long a patient with schizophrenia should remain on risperidone tablets, the effectiveness of risperidone tablets 2 mg/day to 8 mg/day at delaying relapse was demonstrated in a controlled trial in patients who had been clinically stable for at least 4 weeks and were then followed for a period of 1 to 2 years [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

The minimum dose needed to perform a procedure should always be used. In pediatric patients, a solution that is approximately isotonic (Iopamidol Injection, 41%) is recommended for all intrathecal procedures. In children, loss of contrast due to mixing on movement of the medium is less apt to occur because of their shorter spinal cord. The usual recommended pediatric dose range for iopamidol is 1400-2400 mg iodine. Iopamidol formulated to contain more than 200 mgI/mL should not be used intrathecally in children. The minimum dose needed to perform a procedure should always be used. See pediatric dosage table for recommended dosage. Anesthesia is not necessary. However, young children may require general anesthesia for technical reasons. Premedication with sedatives or tranquillizers is usually not needed. In patients with a history of seizure activity who are not on anticonvulsant therapy, premedication with barbiturates or phenytoin should be considered. Lumbar puncture is usually made between L3 and L4; if pathology is suspected at this level, the interspace immediately above or below may be selected. A lateral cervical puncture may also be used. Rate of Injection:To avoid excessive mixing with cerebrospinal fluid and consequent loss of contrast as well as premature cephalad dispersion, injection must be made slowly over one to two minutes; the needle may then be removed. An interval of at least 48 hours should be allowed before repea"

(2.4) 2.1 General Dosing Considerations Rash: There are suggestions, yet to be proven, that the risk of severe, potentially life-threatening rash may be increased by (1) coadministration of LAMICTAL with valproate, (2) exceeding the recommended initial dose of LAMICTAL, or (3) exceeding the recommended dose escalation for LAMICTAL. However, cases have occurred in the absence of these factors [see Boxed Warning]. Therefore, it is important that the dosing recommendations be followed closely. The risk of nonserious rash may be increased when the recommended initial dose and/or the rate of dose escalation of LAMICTAL is exceeded and in patients with a history of allergy or rash to other AEDs. LAMICTAL Starter Kits and LAMICTAL® ODT™ Patient Titration Kits provide LAMICTAL at doses consistent with the recommended titration schedule for the first 5 weeks of treatment, based upon concomitant medications, for patients with epilepsy (>12 years of age) and Bipolar I Disorder (≥18 years of age) and are intended to help reduce the potentia"

Instruct patients not to crush, chew, or swallow tablets (2.2). 2.1 Basic Dosing Information The recommended dosing schedule for ORAVIG is the application of one 50 mg buccal tablet to the upper gum region (canine fossa) once daily for 14 consecutive days. 2.2 Administration Instructions ORAVIG should be applied in the morning, after brushing the teeth. The tablet should be applied with dry hands. The rounded side surface of the tablet should be placed against the upper gum just above the incisor tooth (canine fossa) and held in place with slight pressure over the upper lip for 30 seconds to ensure adhesion. The tablet is round on one side for comfort, but either side of the tablet can be applied to the gum. Once applied, ORAVIG stays in position and gradually dissolves. [ See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] Subsequent applications of ORAVIG should be made to alternate sides of the mouth. Before applying the next tablet, the patient should clear away any remaining tablet material. In addition, ORAVIG should not be crushed, chewed or swallowed. Food and drink can be taken normally when ORAVIG is in place but chewing gum should be avoided. If ORAVIG does not adhere or falls off within the first 6 hours, the same tablet should be repositioned immediately. If the tablet still does not adhere, a new tablet should be placed. If ORAVIG is swallowed within the first 6 hours, the patient should drink a glass of water and a new tablet should be applied only once. If ORAVIG falls off or is swallowed after it was in place for 6 hours or more, a new tablet should not be applied until the next regularly scheduled dose.

The initial dosage of parenterally administered methylprednisolone acetate will vary from 4 to 120 mg depending on the specific disease entity being treated. However, in certain overwhelming, acute, life-threatening situations, administrations in dosages exceeding the usual dosages may be justified and may be in multiples of the oral doses. It Should Be Emphasized that Dosage Requirements are Variable and Must Be Individualized on the Basis of the Disease Under Treatment and the Response of the Patient. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dose should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small increments at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. Situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient’s individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment. In this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of the corticosteroid for a period of time consistent with the patient’s condition. If after long term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. A. Administration for Local Effect Therapy with methylprednisolone acetate does not obviate the need for the conventional measures usually employed.

(2.1) 2.1 General Dosage and Administration Instructions Ephedrine sulfate injection, 50 mg per mL must be diluted before administration as an intravenous bolus to achieve the desired concentration. Dilute with normal saline or 5% dextrose in water. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. 2.2 Dosing for the Treatment of Clinically Important Hypotension in the Setting of Anesthesia Ephedrine sulfate injection should be administered by trained healthcare providers. The recommended dosages for the treatment of clinically important hypotension in the setting of anesthesia is an initial dose of 5 mg to 10 mg administered by intravenous bolus. Administer additional boluses as needed, not to exceed a total dosage of 50 mg. Adjust dosage according to the blood pressure goal (i.e., titrate to effect). 2.3 Prepare a 5 mg per mL Solution for Bolus Intravenous Administration For bolus intravenous administration, prepare a solution containing a final concentration of 5 mg per mL of ephedrine sulfate injection: Withdraw 50 mg (1 mL of 50 mg per mL) of ephedrine sulfate injection and dilute with 9 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection.

The incidence of toxic reactions, particularly the L.E. cell syndrome, is high in the group of patients receiving large doses of hydrALAZINE.In a few resistant patients, up to 300 mg of hydrALAZINE hydrochloride daily may be required for a significant antihypertensive effect. In such cases, a lower dosage of hydrALAZINE combined with a thiazide and/or reserpine or a beta blocker may be considered. However, when combining therapy, individual titration is essential to ensure the lowest possible therapeutic dose of each drug."

For certain low weight individuals, 5 mg may be a sufficient dose. Although the risk of certain adverse events associated with the use of zaleplon appears to be dose dependent, the 20 mg dose has been shown to be adequately tolerated and may be considered for the occasional patient who does not benefit from a trial of a lower dose. Doses above 20 mg have not been adequately evaluated and are not recommended. Zaleplon should be taken immediately before bedtime or after the patient has gone to bed and has experienced difficulty falling asleep (see PRECAUTIONS .). Taking zaleplon with or immediately after a heavy, high-fat meal results in slower absorption and would be expected to reduce the effect of zaleplon on sleep latency (see Pharmacokinetics under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Special Populations Elderly patients and debilitated patients appear to be more sensitive to the effects of hypnotics, and respond to 5 mg of zaleplon. The recommended dose for these patients is therefore 5 mg. Doses over 10 mg are not recommended. Hepatic insufficiency: Patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment should be treated with zaleplon 5 mg because clearance is reduced in this population. Zaleplon is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Renal insufficiency: No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Zaleplon has not been adequately studied in patients with severe renal impairment. An initial dose of 5 mg should be given to patients concomitantly taking cimetidine because zaleplon clearance is reduced in this population (see Drug Interactions under PRECAUTIONS)."

Edema The usual initial dose of furosemide is 20 to 40 mg given as a single dose, injected intramuscularly or intravenously. The intravenous dose should be given slowly (1 to 2 minutes). Ordinarily a prompt diuresis ensues. If needed, another dose may be administered in the same manner 2 hours later or the dose may be increased. The dose may be raised by 20 mg and given not sooner than 2 hours after the previous dose until the desired diuretic effect has been obtained. This individually determined single dose should then be given once or twice daily. Therapy should be individualized according to patient response to gain maximal therapeutic response and to determine the minimal dose needed to maintain that response. Close medical supervision is necessary. If the physician elects to use high dose parenteral therapy, add the furosemide to either Sodium Chloride Injection USP, Lactated Ringer's Injection USP, or Dextrose (5%) Injection USP after pH has been adjusted to above 5.5, and administer as a controlled intravenous infusion at a rate not greater than 4 mg/min. Furosemide Injection is a buffered alkaline solution with a pH of about 9 and drug may precipitate at pH values below 7. Care must be taken to ensure that the pH of the prepared infusion solution is in the weakly alkaline to neutral range. Acid solutions, including other parenteral medications (e.g., labetalol, ciprofloxacin, amrinone, milrinone) must not be administered concurrently in the same infusion because they may cause precipitation of the furosemide. In addition, furosemide injection should not be added to a running intravenous line containing any of these acidic products.

The status of renal function should be estimated by measurement of the serum creatinine concentration or calculation of the endogenous creatinine clearance rate. The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is much less reliable for this purpose. Reassessment of renal function should be made periodically during therapy. Whenever possible, amikacin concentrations in serum should be measured to assure adequate but not excessive levels. It is desirable to measure both peak and trough serum concentrations intermittently during therapy. Peak concentrations (30 to 90 minutes after injection) above 35 micrograms per mL and trough concentrations (just prior to the next dose) above 10 micrograms per mL should be avoided. Dosage should be adjusted as indicated. Intramuscular Administration for Patients with Normal Renal Function The recommended dosage for adults, children and older infants (see WARNINGS box) with normal renal function is 15 mg/kg/day divided into 2 or 3 equal doses administered at equally-divided intervals, i.e., 7.5 mg/kg q12h or 5 mg/kg q8h. Treatment of patients in the heavier weight classes should not exceed 1.5 gram/day.

The usual duration of treatment is 7 to 10 days. It is desirable to limit the duration of treatment to short term whenever feasible. The total daily dose by all routes of administration should not exceed 15 mg/kg/day. In difficult and complicated infections where treatment beyond 10 days is considered, the use of amikacin should be reevaluated.

Postherpetic Neuralgia In adults with postherpetic neuralgia, gabapentin therapy may be initiated as a single 300-mg dose on Day 1, 600 mg/day on Day 2 (divided BID), and 900 mg/day on Day 3 (divided TID). The dose can subsequently be titrated up as needed for pain relief to a daily dose of 1800 mg (divided TID). In clinical studies, efficacy was demonstrated over a range of doses from 1800 mg/day to 3600 mg/day with comparable effects across the dose range. Additional benefit of using doses greater then 1800 mg/day was not demonstrated. Epilepsy Gabapentin is recommended for add-on therapy in patients 3 years of age and older. Effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 3 years has not been established. Patients >12 years of age The effective dose of gabapentin capsules is 900 to 1800 mg/day and given in divided doses (three times a day) using 300 or 400 mg capsules.

If necessary, the dose may be increased using 300 or 400 mg capsules three times a day up to 1800 mg/day Dosages up to 2400 mg/day have been well tolerated in long-term clinical studies. Doses of 3600 mg/day have also been administered to a small number of patients for a relatively short duration, and have been well tolerated.

In outpatient settings there was no evidence of usefulness of doses greater than 225 mg/day for moderately depressed patients, but more severely depressed inpatients responded to a mean dose of 350 mg/day. Certain patients, including more severely depressed patients, may therefore respond more to higher doses, up to a maximum of 375 mg/day, generally in three divided doses (see PRECAUTIONS, General, Use in Patients With Concomitant Illness). Special Populations Treatment of Pregnant Women During the Third TrimesterNeonates exposed to venlafaxine tablets, USP, other SNRIs, or SSRIs, late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding (see PRECAUTIONS).

IMMEDIATELY place the PARCOPA® Tablet on top of the tongue where it will dissolve in seconds, then swallow with saliva. Administration with liquid is not necessary.The optimum daily dosage of PARCOPA® must be determined by careful titration in each patient. PARCOPA® is available in a 1:4 ratio of carbidopa to levodopa (PARCOPA® 25/100) as well as 1:10 ratio (PARCOPA® 25/250 and PARCOPA® 10/100). Tablets of the two ratios may be given separately or combined as needed to provide the optimum dosage.Studies show that peripheral dopa decarboxylase is saturated by carbidopa at approximately 70 to 100 mg a day. Patients receiving less than this amount of carbidopa are more likely to experience nausea and vomiting. Usual Initial Dosage Dosage is best initiated with one tablet of PARCOPA® 25/100 three times a day. This dosage schedule provides 75 mg of carbidopa per day. Dosage may be increased by one tablet every day or every other day, as necessary, until a dosage of eight tablets of PARCOPA® 25/100 a day is reached.If PARCOPA® 10/100 is used, dosage may be initiated with one tablet three or four times a day. However, this will not provide an adequate amount of carbidopa for many patients. Dosage may be increased by one tablet every day or every other day until a total of eight tablets (2 tablets q.i.d.) is reached. How to Transfer Patients from Levodopa Levodopa must be discontinued at least twelve hours before starting PARCOPA® (carbidopa-levodopa orally disintegrating tablets). A daily dosage of PARCOPA® should be chosen that will provide approximately 25 percent of the previous levodopa dosage. Patients who are taking less than 1500 mg of levodopa a day should be started on one tablet of PARCOPA® 25/100 three or four times a day.

(2.5) Oral Solution Concentration and Dispensing (2.6) 2.1 Neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy The maximum recommended dose of LYRICA is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL/min. Begin dosing at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Because LYRICA is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, adjust the dose in patients with reduced renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Although LYRICA was also studied at 600 mg/day, there is no evidence that this dose confers additional significant benefit and this dose was less well tolerated. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions, treatment with doses above 300 mg/day is not recommended [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 2.2 Postherpetic neuralgia The recommended dose of LYRICA is 75 to 150 mg two times a day, or 50 to 100 mg three times a day (150 to 300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL/min.

After observing the response to initial therapy with ketoprofen immediate-release capsules and ketoprofen extended-release capsules, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs. Concomitant use of ketoprofen immediate-release capsules and ketoprofen extended-release capsules is not recommended. If minor side effects appear, they may disappear at a lower dose which may still have an adequate therapeutic effect. If well tolerated but not optimally effective, the dosage may be increased. Individual patients may show a better response to 300 mg of ketoprofen immediate-release capsules daily as compared to 200 mg, although in well controlled clinical trials patients on 300 mg did not show greater mean effectiveness. They did, however, show an increased frequency of upper and lower GI distress and headaches. It is of interest that women also had an increased frequency of these adverse effects compared to men. When treating patients with 300 mg/day, the physician should observe sufficient increased clinical benefit to offset potential increased risk.

(2.3) 2.1 Schizophrenia Adults The recommended dose of paliperidone extended-release tablets for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults is 6 mg administered once daily. Initial dose titration is not required. Although it has not been systematically established that doses above 6 mg have additional benefit, there was a general trend for greater effects with higher doses. This must be weighed against the dose-related increase in adverse reactions. Thus, some patients may benefit from higher doses, up to 12 mg/day, and for some patients, a lower dose of 3 mg/day may be sufficient. Dose increases above 6 mg/day should be made only after clinical reassessment and generally should occur at intervals of more than 5 days. When dose increases are indicated, increments of 3 mg/day are recommended. The maximum recommended dose is 12 mg/day. In a longer-term study, paliperidone extended-release tablets have been shown to be effective in delaying time to relapse in patients with schizophrenia who were stabilized on paliperidone extended-release tablets for 6 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Paliperidone extended-release tablets should be prescribed at the lowest effective dose for maintaining clinical stability and the physician should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug in individual patients. Adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) The recommended starting dose of paliperidone extended-release tablets for the treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age is 3 mg administered once daily.

Doses above 40 mg/day are not recommended due to the risk of QT prolongation. Additionally, the only study pertinent to dose response for effectiveness did not demonstrate an advantage for the 60 mg/day dose over the 40 mg/day dose. Special Populations 20 mg/day is the maximum recommended dose for patients who are greater than 60 years of age, patients with hepatic impairment, and for CYP2C19 poor metabolizers or those patients taking cimetidine or another CYP2C19 inhibitor ( see WARNINGS ).

In very serious infections or if clinical responsiveness is insufficient within the expected time, the dose of ketoconazole may be increased to 400 mg (two tablets) once daily. Children In small numbers of children over 2 years of age, a single daily dose of 3.3 to 6.6 mg/kg has been used. Ketoconazole tablets have not been studied in children under 2 years of age. There should be laboratory as well as clinical documentation of infection prior to starting ketoconazole therapy. Treatment should be continued until tests indicate that active fungal infection has subsided. Inadequate periods of treatment may yield poor response and lead to early recurrence of clinical symptoms. Minimum treatment for candidiasis is one or two weeks. Patients with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis usually require maintenance therapy. Minimum treatment for the other indicated systemic mycoses is six months. Minimum treatment for recalcitrant dermatophyte infections is four weeks in cases involving glabrous skin. Palmar and plantar infections may respond more slowly. Apparent cures may subsequently recur after discontinuation of therapy in some cases."

While the usual daily dosages given below will meet the needs of most patients, there will be some who require doses greater than 4 mg/day. In such cases, dosage should be increased cautiously to avoid adverse effects. Anxiety Disorders and Transient Symptoms of Anxiety Treatment for patients with anxiety should be initiated with a dose of 0.25 to 0.5 mg given three times daily. The dose may be increased to achieve a maximum therapeutic effect, at intervals of 3 to 4 days, to a maximum daily dose of 4 mg, given in divided doses. The lowest possible effective dose should be employed and the need for continued treatment reassessed frequently. The risk of dependence may increase with dose and duration of treatment. In all patients, dosage should be reduced gradually when discontinuing therapy or when decreasing the daily dosage. Although there are no systematically collected data to support a specific discontinuation schedule, it is suggested that the daily dosage be decreased by no more than 0.5 mg every three days. Some patients may require an even slower dosage reduction. Panic Disorder The successful treatment of many panic disorder patients has required the use of alprazolam at doses greater than 4 mg daily. In controlled trials conducted to establish the efficacy of alprazolam in panic disorder, doses in the range of 1 to 10 mg daily were used. The mean dosage employed was approximately 5 to 6 mg daily. Among the approximately 1700 patients participating in the panic disorder development program, about 300 received alprazolam in dosages of greater than 7 mg/day, including approximately 100 patients who received maximum dosages of greater than 9 mg/day. Occasional patients required as much as 10 mg a day to achieve a successful response. Dose Titration Treatment may be initiated with a dose of 0.5 mg three times daily.

The goal of suppressive therapy is to inhibit growth and/or function of abnormal thyroid tissue.

Hence, the following recommendations serve only as dosing guidelines. Dosing must be individualized and adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests ). Levothyroxine Sodium Tablets, USP should be taken in the morning on an empty stomach, at least one-half hour to one hour before any food is eaten. Levothyroxine Sodium Tablets, USP should be taken at least 4 hours apart from drugs that are known to interfere with its absorption (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ). Due to the long half-life of levothyroxine, the peak therapeutic effect at a given dose of levothyroxine sodium may not be attained for 4-6 weeks. Caution should be exercised when administering Levothyroxine Sodium Tablets, USP to patients with underlying cardiovascular disease, to the elderly, and to those with concomitant adrenal insufficiency (see PRECAUTIONS ).

Dosage should be adjusted according to blood pressure response. The usual dosage range is 20 to 40 mg per day administered in a single daily dose. The antihypertensive effect may diminish toward the end of the dosing interval regardless of the administered dose, but most commonly with a dose of 10 mg daily. This can be evaluated by measuring blood pressure just prior to dosing to determine whether satisfactory control is being maintained for 24 hours. If it is not, an increase in dose should be considered. Doses up to 80 mg have been used but do not appear to give greater effect. If blood pressure is not controlled with lisinopril tablets, USP alone, a low dose of a diuretic may be added. Hydrochlorothiazide, 12.5 mg has been shown to provide an additive effect. After the addition of a diuretic, it may be possible to reduce the dose of lisinopril tablets, USP. Diuretic Treated Patients: In hypertensive patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic hypotension may occur occasionally following the initial dose of lisinopril tablets, USP. The diuretic should be discontinued, if possible, for two to three days before beginning therapy with lisinopril tablets, USP to reduce the likelihood of hypotension. (See WARNINGS.) The dosage of lisinopril tablets, USP should be adjusted according to blood pressure response. If the patient's blood pressure is not controlled with lisinopril tablets, USP alone, diuretic therapy may be resumed as described above. If the diuretic cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 5 mg should be used under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour.

Every dosing regimen for organic nitrates including dilatrate®-SR must provide a daily nitrate-free interval to avoid the development of tolerance. To achieve the necessary nitrate-free interval with immediate-release oral ISDN, it appears that at least one of the daily interdose intervals must be at least 14 hours long. The necessary interdose interval for dilatrate®-SR has not been clearly identified, but it must be greater than 18 hours.As noted under Clinical Pharmacology, only one trial has ever studied the use of extended-release isosorbide dinitrate for more than one dose. In that trial, 40 mg of dilatrate®-SR was administered twice daily in doses given 6 hours apart. After 4 weeks, dilatrate®-SR could not be distinguished from placebo.Large controlled studies with other nitrates suggest that no dosing regimen with dilatrate®-SR should be expected to provide more than about 12 hours of continuous antianginal efficacy per day.In clinical trials, immediate-release oral isosorbide dinitrate has been administered in a variety of regimens, with total daily doses ranging from 30 to 480 mg.Do not exceed 160 mg (4 capsules) per day."

In order to insure that an antiarrhythmic effect will be observed without waiting several months, loading doses are required. A uniform, optimal dosage schedule for administration of amiodarone has not been determined. Because of the food effect on absorption, amiodarone should be administered consistently with regard to meals (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Individual patient titration is suggested according to the following guidelines: For life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation or hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia: Close monitoring of the patients is indicated during the loading phase, particularly until risk of recurrent ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation has abated. Because of the serious nature of the arrhythmia and the lack of predictable time course of effect, loading should be performed in a hospital setting. Loading doses of 800 to 1,600 mg/day are required for 1 to 3 weeks (occasionally longer) until initial therapeutic response occurs. (Administration of amiodarone in divided doses with meals is suggested for total daily doses of 1,000 mg or higher, or when gastrointestinal intolerance occurs.) If side effects become excessive, the dose should be reduced. Elimination of recurrence of ventricular fibrillation and tachycardia usually occurs within 1 to 3 weeks, along with reduction in complex and total ventricular ectopic beats.

Children and adolescents (8 -17 years): Recommended starting dose is 25 mg at bedtime, with increases of 25 mg every 4 to 7 days as tolerated to maximum effect, not to exceed 200 mg/day (8 -11 years) or 300 mg/day (12 -17 years). Daily doses over 50 mg should be divided (2.2). Hepatically impaired: Decreased clearance may require modified dose and titration (2.3). Extended treatment: Adjust dose to maintain lowest effective dose; reassess patients periodically (2.7). Discontinuation: Gradual dose reduction is recommended (2.8, see Warnings And Precautions [5.8]). 2.1 Adults The recommended starting dose for Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets in adult patients is 50 mg, administered as a single daily dose at bedtime. In the controlled clinical trials establishing the effectiveness of Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets in OCD, patients were titrated within a dose range of 100 to 300 mg/day. Consequently, the dose should be increased in 50 mg increments every 4 to 7 days, as tolerated, until maximum therapeutic benefit is achieved, not to exceed 300 mg per day. It is advisable that a total daily dose of more than 100 mg should be given in two divided doses.

Patients may be given the equivalent dose of amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets or a dose of amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets with increased amounts of amlodipine, atorvastatin, or both for additional antianginal effects, blood pressure lowering, or lipid-lowering effect. Amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets may be used to provide additional therapy for patients already on one of their components. Amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets may be used to initiate treatment in patients with hyperlipidemia and either hypertension or angina. Important Dosage Information Take amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets orally once daily at any time of the day, with or without food. Amlodipine The usual initial antihypertensive oral dosage of amlodipine is 5 mg once daily, and the maximum dose is 10 mg once daily. Pediatric (age > 6 years), small adult, fragile, or elderly patients, or patients with hepatic insufficiency may be started on 2.5 mg once daily and this dose may be used when adding amlodipine to other antihypertensive therapy. Adjust dosage according to blood pressure goals. In general, wait 7 to 14 days between titration steps. Titration may proceed more rapidly, however, if clinically warranted, provided the patient is assessed frequently. Angina: The recommended dosage of amlodipine for chronic stable or vasospastic angina is 5-10 mg, with the lower dose suggested in the elderly and in patients with hepatic insufficiency.

If applying with a cotton-tipped applicator, which is recommended, use once and discard. Salicylic Acid 3% topical ointment should be applied twice a day for best results. Gently rinse the area to be treated with saline or water and then pat dry. Salicylic Acid 3% topical ointment can be applied directly to the wound or placed on dry gauze and then placed on the wound. Wet-Packs or Wet-To-Dry Dressings are not recommended since they will dilute the ointment and decrease its effectiveness. Salicylic Acid 3% topical ointment is designed to provide moisture to the wound. Spread a generous quantity of Salicylic Acid 3% topical ointment evenly over the desired area to yield a thin continuous layer of approximately 1/8 of an inch of thickness. There may be a mild warming sensation, or slight burning, to the treated area for 3-5 minutes after application. If irritation occurs or symptoms persist after 10 days, discontinue use and consult your physician. Try to keep the area being treated clean and exposed to air when possible. Apply an appropriate dressing to shield the area from clothes or exposure to water or dirt. If there is no improvement in the wound within 7 days, consult your physician for further evaluation of the wound. If there is no response to the ointment at all, then the wound should be re-evaluated for other contributing factors to the wound healing process."

VYTORIN should be used as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable. 2.3 Patients with Hepatic Impairment No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 2.4 Patients with Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. However, for patients with severe renal insufficiency, VYTORIN should not be started unless the patient has already tolerated treatment with simvastatin at a dose of 5 mg or higher. Caution should be exercised when VYTORIN is administered to these patients, and they should be closely monitored [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1); Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.5 Geriatric Patients No dosage adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.6 Chinese Patients Taking Lipid-Modifying Doses (≥1 g/day Niacin) of Niacin-Con"

THE INTENT OF THIS PHARMACY BULK PACKAGE IS FOR PREPARATION OF SOLUTIONS FOR IV INFUSION ONLY. Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection should be administered by slow intravenous injection over at least 10 to 15 minutes or can also be delivered in greater dilutions with 50 to 100 mL of a compatible diluent as an intravenous infusion over 15 to 30 minutes. The recommended adult dosage of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is 1.5 grams (1 gram ampicillin as the sodium salt plus 0.5 gram sulbactam as the sodium salt) to 3 grams (2 grams ampicillin as the sodium salt plus 1 gram sulbactam as the sodium salt) every six hours. This 1.5 to 3 grams range represents the total of ampicillin content plus the sulbactam content of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection, and corresponds to a range of 1 gram ampicillin/0.5 gram sulbactam to 2 grams ampicillin/1 gram sulbactam. The total dose of sulbactam should not exceed 4 grams per day. Pediatric Patients 1 Year of Age or Older The recommended daily dose of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection in pediatric patients is 300 mg per kg of body weight administered via intravenous infusion in equally divided doses every 6 hours. This 300 mg/kg/day dosage represents the total ampicillin content plus the sulbactam content of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection, and corresponds to 200 mg ampicillin/100 mg sulbactam per kg per day. The safety and efficacy of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection administered via intramuscular injection in pediatric patients have not been established. Pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or more should be dosed according to adult recommendations, and the total dose of sulbactam should not exceed 4 grams per day.

It is recommended that leflunomide therapy be initiated with a loading dose of one 100 mg tablet per day for 3 days. Elimination of the loading dose regimen may decrease the risk of adverse events. This could be especially important for patients at increased risk of hematologic or hepatic toxicity, such as those receiving concomitant treatment with methotrexate or other immunosuppressive agents or on such medications in the recent past. (See WARNINGS: Hepatotoxicity ). Maintenance Therapy Daily dosing of 20 mg is recommended for treatment of patients with RA. A small cohort of patients (n=104), treated with 25 mg/day, experienced a greater incidence of side effects; alopecia, weight loss, liver enzyme elevations. Doses higher than 20 mg/day are not recommended. If dosing at 20 mg/day is not well tolerated clinically, the dose may be decreased to 10 mg daily. Liver enzymes must be monitored and dose adjustments may be necessary (see WARNINGS: Hepatotoxicity ). Due to the prolonged half-life of the active metabolite of leflunomide, patients should be carefully observed after dose reduction, since it may take several weeks for metabolite levels to decline."

Therapy should generally be continued for 14 to 21 days or until there is resolution of active fungal keratitis. In many cases, it may be helpful to reduce the dosage gradually at 4 to 7 day intervals to assure that the replicating organism has been eliminated. Less frequent initial dosage (4 to 6 daily applications) may be sufficient in fungal blepharitis and conjunctivitis."

Aluminum reacts with Cisplatin Injection, causing precipitate formation and a loss of potency. Metastatic Testicular Tumors The usual Cisplatin Injection dose for the treatment of testicular cancer in combination with other approved chemotherapeutic agents is 20 mg/m2 IV daily for 5 days per cycle. Metastatic Ovarian Tumors The usual Cisplatin Injection dose for the treatment of metastatic ovarian tumors in combination with cyclophosphamide is 75 to 100 mg/m2 IV per cycle once every four weeks (DAY 1). The dose of cyclophosphamide when used in combination with Cisplatin Injection is 600 mg/m2 IV once every 4 weeks (DAY 1). For directions for the administration of cyclophosphamide, refer to the cyclophosphamide package insert. In combination therapy, Cisplatin Injection and cyclophosphamide are administered sequentially. As a single agent, Cisplatin Injection should be administered at a dose of 100 mg/m2 IV per cycle once every four weeks.

In severe or complicated infections, a 1.5-gram dose every 8 hours is recommended. In bone and joint infections, a 1.5-gram dose every 8 hours is recommended. In clinical trials, surgical intervention was performed when indicated as an adjunct to therapy with Cefuroxime for Injection. A course of oral antibiotics was administered when appropriate following the completion of parenteral administration of Cefuroxime for Injection. In life-threatening infections or infections due to less susceptible organisms, 1.5 grams every 6 hours may be required. In bacterial meningitis, the dosage should not exceed 3 grams every 8 hours. The recommended dosage for uncomplicated gonococcal infection is 1.5 grams given intramuscularly as a single dose at 2 different sites together with 1 gram of oral probenecid. For preventive use for clean-contaminated or potentially contaminated surgical procedures, a 1.5-gram dose administered intravenously just before surgery (approximately one-half to 1 hour before the initial incision) is recommended. Thereafter, give 750 mg intravenously or intramuscularly every 8 hours when the procedure is prolonged. For preventive use during open heart surgery, a 1.5-gram dose administered intravenously at the induction of anesthesia and every 12 hours thereafter for a total of 6 grams is recommended. Impaired Renal Function A reduced dosage must be employed when renal function is impaired.

A treatment regimen using a ZOLADEX 3.6 mg depot 8 weeks before radiotherapy, followed in 28 days by the ZOLADEX 10.8 mg depot, can be administered. Alternatively, four injections of 3.6 mg depot can be administered at 28-day intervals, two depots preceding and two during radiotherapy. 2.2 Prostatic Carcinoma For the management of advanced prostate cancer, ZOLADEX is intended for long-term administration unless clinically inappropriate. 2.3 Endometriosis For the management of endometriosis, the recommended duration of administration is 6 months. Currently, there are no clinical data on the effect of treatment of benign gynecological conditions with ZOLADEX for periods in excess of 6 months. Retreatment cannot be recommended for the management of endometriosis since safety data for retreatment are not available. If the symptoms of endometriosis recur after a course of therapy, and further treatment with ZOLADEX is contemplated, consideration should be given to monitoring bone mineral density.

In clinical trials of amlodipine/benazepril combination therapy using amlodipine doses of 2.5 mg to 10 mg and benazepril doses of 10 mg to 40 mg, the antihypertensive effects increased with increasing dose of amlodipine in all patient groups, and the effects increased with increasing dose of benazepril in nonblack groups. The antihypertensive effect of amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride capsules is largely attained within 2 weeks. It is usually appropriate to begin therapy with amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride capsules only after a patient has either (a) failed to achieve the desired antihypertensive effect with one or the other monotherapy, or (b) demonstrated inability to achieve adequate antihypertensive effect with amlodipine therapy without developing edema. Renal Impairment: Regimens of therapy with amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride capsules need not take account of renal function as long as the patient’s creatinine clearance is >30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (serum creatinine roughly ≤3 mg/dL or 265 μmol/L). Amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride capsules are not recommended in patients with more severe renal impairment. Hepatic Impairment and Elderly Patients: The recommended initial dose of amlodipine, as monotherapy or as a component of combination therapy, is 2.5 mg. Dose once-daily May be used as add-on therapy for patients not adequately controlled with either a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker or an ACE inhibitor (2.2) Patients who experience edema with amlodipine may be switched to amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride capsules containing a lower dose of amlodipine (2.2) Start amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride capsules at 2.5/10 mg in patients ≥75 years old or in patients with hepatic impairment (2.1) "

In the NSABP B-14 adjuvant study in women with node-negative breast cancer, one 10 mg tamoxifen citrate tablet was given twice a day for at least 5 years. Results of the B-14 study suggest that continuation of therapy beyond five years does not provide additional benefit (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). In the EBCTCG 1995 overview, the reduction in recurrence and mortality was greater in those studies that used tamoxifen for about 5 years than in those that used tamoxifen for a shorter period of therapy. There was no indication that doses greater than 20 mg per day were more effective. Current data from clinical trials support 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy for patients with breast cancer.

The dosage range is 5-80 mg/day (see below).The recommended usual starting dose is 20 to 40 mg once a day in the evening. For patients at high risk for a CHD event due to existing coronary heart disease, diabetes, peripheral vessel disease, history of stroke or other cerebrovascular disease, the recommended starting dose is 40 mg/day. The orally disintegrating tablet should be placed on the tongue where it will dissolve and then be swallowed with the saliva. If necessary, follow with water.Lipid determinations should be performed after 4 weeks of therapy and periodically thereafter. See below for dosage recommendations in special populations (i.e., homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, adolescents and renal insufficiency) or for patients receiving concomitant therapy (i.e., cyclosporine, danazol, amiodarone, verapamil, or gemfibrozil). Patients with Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia The recommended dosage for patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is Simvastatin Orally Disintegrating Tablets 40 mg/day in the evening or 80 mg/day in 3 divided doses of 20 mg, 20 mg, and an evening dose of 40 mg. Simvastatin Orally Disintegrating Tablets should be used as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable. Adolescents (10-17 years of age) with Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia The recommended usual starting dose is 10 mg once a day in the evening. The recommended dosi"

All of these might affect the enteric coating. Duloxetine delayed-release capsules can be given without regard to meals. 2.1 Initial Treatment Major Depressive Disorder Duloxetine should be administered at a total dose of 40 mg/day (given as 20 mg twice daily) to 60 mg/day (given either once daily or as 30 mg twice daily). For some patients, it may be desirable to start at 30 mg once daily for 1 week, to allow patients to adjust to the medication before increasing to 60 mg once daily. While a 120 mg/day dose was shown to be effective, there is no evidence that doses greater than 60 mg/day confer any additional benefits. The safety of doses above 120 mg/day has not been adequately evaluated [see CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14.1 )].

No more than three metered sprays are recommended within a 15-minute period. If the chest pain persists, prompt medical attention is recommended. Nitrolingual® Pumpspray may be used prophylactically five to ten minutes prior to engaging in activities which might precipitate an acute attack. Each metered spray of Nitrolingual® Pumpspray delivers 48 mg of solution containing 400 mcg of nitroglycerin after an initial priming of 5 sprays. It will remain adequately primed for 6 weeks.If the product is not used within 6 weeks it can be adequately reprimed with 1 spray. Longer storage periods without use may require up to 5 repriming sprays. There are 60 or 200 metered sprays per bottle. The total number of available doses is dependent, however, on the number of sprays per use (1 or 2 sprays), and the frequency of repriming. The transparent container can be used for continuous monitoring of the consumption. The end of the pump should be covered by the fluid level. Once fluid falls below the level of the center tube, sprays will not be adequate and the container should be replaced. As with all other sprays, there is a residual volume of fluid at the bottom of the bottle which cannot be used. During application the patient should rest, ideally in the sitting position. The container should be held vertically with the valve head uppermost and the spray orifice as close to the mouth as possible. The dose should preferably be sprayed onto the tongue by pressing the button firmly and the mouth should be closed immediately after each dose. THE SPRAY SHOULD NOT BE INHALED. The medication should not be expectorated or the mouth rinsed for 5 to 10 minutes following administration. Patients should be instructed to familiarize themselves with the position of the spray orifice, which can be identified by the finger rest on top of the valve, in order to facilit"

Daily dosage can be increased to 10, 20 and then to 40 mg in single or divided doses if required for optimum blood pressure control. The effective dosage range is usually 10 to 40 mg per day. The maximum recommended dosage is 100 mg per day. Patients under 12 years of age: The initial dosage is 0.2 mg/kg minoxidil as a single daily dose. The dosage may be increased in 50 to 100% increments until optimum blood pressure control is achieved. The effective dosage range is usually 0.25 to 1 mg/kg/day. The maximum recommended dosage is 50 mg daily (see 9. Pediatric Use under PRECAUTIONS). Dose frequency: The magnitude of within-day fluctuation of arterial pressure during therapy with minoxidil is directly proportional to the extent of pressure reduction. If supine diastolic pressure has been reduced less than 30 mm Hg, the drug need be administered only once a day; if supine diastolic pressure has been reduced more than 30 mm Hg, the daily dosage should be divided into two equal parts. Frequency of dosage adjustment: Dosage must be titrated carefully according to individual response. Intervals between dosage adjustments normally should be at least 3 days since the full response to a given dose is not obtained for at least that amount of time. Where a more rapid management of hypertension is required, dose adjustments can be made every 6 hours if the patient is carefully monitored. Concomitant therapy: Diuretic and beta-blocker or other sympathetic nervous system suppressant. Diuretics: Minoxidil must be used in conjunction with a diuretic in patients relying on renal function for maintaining salt and water balance. Diuretics have been used at the following dosages when starting therapy with minoxidil: hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg, b.i.d.) or other thiazides at equieffective dosage; chlorthalidone (50 to 100 mg, once "

A number of the more common side effects are dose-related. Individualization of dosage is required to achieve sufficient therapeutic response while minimizing side effects. Therapy with acitretin capsules should be initiated at 25 to 50 mg per day, given as a single dose with the main meal. Maintenance doses of 25 to 50 mg per day may be given dependent upon an individual patient’s response to initial treatment. Relapses may be treated as outlined for initial therapy. When acitretin capsules are used with phototherapy, the prescriber should decrease the phototherapy dose, dependent on the patient’s individual response (see PRECAUTIONS: General). Females who have taken TEGISON (etretinate) must continue to follow the contraceptive recommendations for TEGISON. TEGISON is no longer marketed in the U.S.; for information, call Mylan at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX). Information for Pharmacists Acitretin capsules must only be dispensed in no more than a monthly supply. An acitretin capsules Medication Guide must be given to the patient each time acitretin capsules are dispensed, as required by law."

(2.4) 2.1 Dosage and Administration Overview •Octreotide acetate injection may be administered subcutaneously or intravenously. Pain with subcutaneous administration may be reduced by using the smallest volume that will deliver the desired dose. Sites should be rotated in a systematic manner. The needle shield of the prefilled syringes may contain natural rubber latex which may cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. •Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not use if particulates and/or discoloration are observed. Octreotide acetate injection is not compatible in Total Parenteral Nutrition solutions because of the formation of a glycosyl octreotide conjugate which may decrease the efficacy of the product. •Octreotide acetate injection may be diluted in volumes of 50 mL to 200 mL and infused intravenously over 15 to 30 minutes or administered by intravenous (IV) push over 3 minutes. In emergency situations (e.g., carcinoid crisis), it may be given by rapid bolus.

Losartan potassium tablets USP can be administered once or twice daily with total daily doses ranging from 25 mg to 100 mg. If the antihypertensive effect measured at trough using once-a-day dosing is inadequate, a twice-a-day regimen at the same total daily dose or an increase in dose may give a more satisfactory response. The effect of losartan is substantially present within one week but in some studies the maximal effect occurred in 3 to 6 weeks (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects, Hypertension). If blood pressure is not controlled by losartan potassium tablets USP alone, a low dose of a diuretic may be added. Hydrochlorothiazide has been shown to have an additive effect (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects, Hypertension). No initial dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients or for patients with renal impairment, including patients on dialysis. Pediatric Hypertensive Patients ≥ 6 Years of Age The usual recommended starting dose is 0.7 mg/kg once daily (up to 50 mg total) administered as a tablet or a suspension (see Preparation of Suspension).

Partial Onset Seizures Adults 16 Years And Older In clinical trials, daily doses of 1000 mg, 2000 mg, and 3000 mg, given as twice daily dosing, were shown to be effective. Although in some studies there was a tendency toward greater response with higher dose (see CLINICAL STUDIES ), a consistent increase in response with increased dose has not been shown. Treatment should be initiated with a daily dose of 1000 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg BID). Additional dosing increments may be given (1000 mg/day additional every 2 weeks) to a maximum recommended daily dose of 3000 mg. Doses greater than 3000 mg/day have been used in open-label studies for periods of 6 months and longer. There is no evidence that doses greater than 3000 mg/day confer additional benefit. Pediatric Patients Ages 4 To <16 Years Treatment should be initiated with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg BID). The daily dose should be increased every 2 weeks by increments of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg (30 mg/kg BID). If a patient cannot tolerate a daily dose of 60 mg/kg, the daily dose may be reduced. In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 52 mg/kg. Patients with body weight ≤20 kg should be dosed with oral solution. Patients with body weight above 20 kg can be dosed with either tablets or oral solution.

Syphilis of more than one year’s duration (except neurosyphilis)-500 mg q.i.d. for 30 days. For treatment of gonorrhea, the recommended dose is 500 mg by mouth four times a day for seven days. In cases of moderate to severe acne which, in the judgement of the clinician, require long-term treatment, the recommended initial dosage is 1 gram daily in divided doses. When improvement is noted, dosage should be gradually reduced to maintenance levels ranging from 125 mg to 500 mg daily. In some patients it may be possible to maintain adequate remission of lesions with alternate-day or intermittent therapy.

    "package_label": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION When Lidocaine Ointment USP, 5% is used concomitantly with other products containing lidocaine, the total dose contributed by all formulations must be kept in mind. Adult A single application should not exceed 5 g of Lidocaine Ointment USP, 5% containing 250 mg of lidocaine base (equivalent chemically to approximately 300 mg of lidocaine hydrochloride). This is roughly equivalent to squeezing a six (6) inch length of ointment from the tube. In a 70 kg adult this dose equals 3.6 mg/kg (1.6 mg/lb) lidocaine base. No more than one-half tube, approximately 17 to 20 g of ointment or 850 to 1000 mg lidocaine base should be administered in any one day. Although the incidence of adverse effects with Lidocaine Ointment USP, 5% is quite low, caution should be exercised, particularly when employing large amounts, since the incidence of adverse effects is directly proportional to the total dose of local anesthetic agent administered. Dosage for children It is difficult to recommend a maximum dose of any drug for children since this varies as a function of age and weight. For children less than ten years who have a normal lean body mass and a normal lean body development, the maximum dose may be determined by the application of one of the standard pediatric drug formulas (e.g., Clark's rule). For example, in a child of five years weighing 50 lbs., the dose of lidocaine should not exceed 75 to 100 mg when calculated according to Clark's rule. In any case, the maximum amount of lidocaine administered should not exceed 4.5 mg/kg (2.0 mg/lb) of body weight. Administration For medical use, apply topically for adequate control of symptoms. The use of a sterile gauze pad is suggested for application to broken skin tissue. Apply to the tube prior to intubation. In dentistry, apply to previously dried oral mucosa.

Hepatic impairment: RAPAFLO has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score > 10) and is therefore contraindicated in these patients. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

The recommended initial dose is 20 mg/day. Patients were dosed in a range of 20 to 50 mg/day in the clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of paroxetine tablets in the treatment of major depressive disorder. As with all drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder, the full effect may be delayed. Some patients not responding to a 20-mg dose may benefit from dose increases, in 10-mg/day increments, up to a maximum of 50 mg/day. Dose changes should occur at intervals of at least 1 week. Maintenance Therapy: There is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the patient treated with paroxetine tablets should remain on it. It is generally agreed that acute episodes of major depressive disorder require several months or longer of sustained pharmacologic therapy. Whether the dose needed to induce remission is identical to the dose needed to maintain and/or sustain euthymia is unknown. Systematic evaluation of the efficacy of paroxetine tablets has shown that efficacy is maintained for periods of up to 1 year with doses that averaged about 30 mg. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder: Usual Initial Dosage: Paroxetine tablets should be administered as a single daily dose with or without food, usually in the morning. The recommended dose of paroxetine tablets in the treatment of OCD is 40 mg daily. Patients should be started on 20 mg/day and the dose can be increased in 10-mg/day increments. Dose changes should occur at intervals of at least 1 week. Patients were dosed in a range of 20 to 60 mg/day in the clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of paroxetine tablets in the treatment of OCD. The maximum dosage should not exceed 60 mg/day.

BECAUSE SERIOUS AND LIFE-THREATENING CARDIORESPIRATORY ADVERSE EVENTS HAVE BEEN REPORTED, PROVISION FOR MONITORING, DETECTION AND CORRECTION OF THESE REACTIONS MUST BE MADE FOR EVERY PATIENT TO WHOM MIDAZOLAM INJECTION IS ADMINISTERED, REGARDLESS OF AGE OR HEALTH STATUS. Excessive single doses or rapid intravenous administration may result in respiratory depression, airway obstruction and/or arrest. The potential for these latter effects is increased in debilitated patients, those receiving concomitant medications capable of depressing the CNS, and patients without an endotracheal tube but undergoing a procedure involving the upper airway such as endoscopy or dental (see Boxed WARNING and WARNINGS .) Reactions such as agitation, involuntary movements, hyperactivity and combativeness have been reported in adult and pediatric patients. Should such reactions occur, caution should be exercised before continuing administration of midazolam (see WARNINGS ). Midazolam Injection should only be administered intramuscular or intravenous (see WARNINGS ). Care should be taken to avoid intra-arterial injection or extravasation (see WARNINGS ). Midazolam Injection may be mixed in the same syringe with the following frequently used premedications: morphine sulfate, meperidine, atropine sulfate or scopolamine.

Oxcarbazepine is also recommended as monotherapy in the treatment of partial seizures in adults and children aged 4-16 years. All dosing should be given in a twice-a-day (BID) regimen. Oxcarbazepine oral suspension and oxcarbazepine film-coated tablets may be interchanged at equal doses. Oxcarbazepine should be kept out of the reach and sight of children. Oxcarbazepine can be taken with or without food (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics subsection). Adults Adjunctive Therapy Treatment with oxcarbazepine should be initiated with a dose of 600 mg/day, given in a BID regimen. If clinically indicated, the dose may be increased by a maximum of 600 mg/day at approximately weekly intervals; the recommended daily dose is 1200 mg/day. Daily doses above 1200 mg/day show somewhat greater effectiveness in controlled trials, but most patients were not able to tolerate the 2400 mg/day dose, primarily because of CNS effects. It is recommended that the patient be observed closely and plasma levels of the concomitant AEDs be monitored during the period of oxcarbazepine titration, as these plasma levels may be altered, especially at oxcarbazepine doses greater than 1200 mg/day (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug interactions subsection). Conversion to Monotherapy Patients receiving concomitant AEDs may be converted to monotherapy by initiating treatment with oxcarbazepine at 600 mg/day (given in a BID regimen) while simultaneously initiating the reduction of the dose of the concomitant AEDs. The concomitant AEDs should be completely withdrawn over 3-6 weeks, while the maximum dose of oxcarbazepine should be reached in about 2-4 weeks. Oxcarbazepine may be increased as clinically indicated by a maximum increment of 600 mg/day at approximately weekly intervals to achieve the recommended daily dose of 2400 mg/day.

The recommended dosage range is 2.5 - 10 mg once daily. In clinical trials, doses above 10 mg daily showed an increased blood pressure response but a large increase in the rate of peripheral edema and other vasodilatory adverse events (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Modification of the recommended dosage is usually not required in patients with renal impairment. Felodipine extended-release tablets should regularly be taken either without food or with a light meal (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism ). Felodipine extended-release tablets should be swallowed whole and not crushed or chewed. Geriatric Use Patients over 65 years of age are likely to develop higher plasma concentrations of felodipine (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range (2.5 mg daily). Elderly patients should have their blood pressure closely monitored during any dosage adjustment. Patients with Impaired Liver Function Patients with impaired liver function may have elevated plasma concentrations of felodipine and may respond to lower doses of felodipine extended-release tablets; therefore, patients should have their blood pressure monitored closely during dosage adjustment of felodipine extended-release tablets (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY )."

    "package_label": "DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION The usual recommended starting dose of candesartan cilexetil is 16 mg once daily when it is used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume depleted. ATACAND can be administered once or twice daily with total daily doses ranging from 8 mg to 32 mg. Patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure should be titrated to 32 mg. Doses larger than 32 mg do not appear to have a greater blood pressure lowering effect. Hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 to 50 mg once daily. To minimize dose-independent side effects, it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy. The side effects (See WARNINGS) of candesartan cilexetil are generally rare and apparently independent of dose; those of hydrochlorothiazide are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily hypokalemia) and dose-independent phenomena (eg, pancreatitis), the former much more common than the latter. Therapy with any combination of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide will be associated with both sets of dose-independent side effects. Replacement Therapy: The combination may be substituted for the titrated components. Dose Titration by Clinical Effect: A patient whose blood pressure is not controlled on 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide once daily can expect an incremental effect from ATACAND HCT 16-12.5 mg. A patient whose blood pressure is controlled on 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide but is experiencing decreases in serum potassium can expect the same or incremental blood pressure effects from ATACAND HCT 16-12.5 mg and serum potassium may improve. A patient whose blood pressure is not controlled on 32 mg of ATACAND can expect incremental blood pressure effects from ATACAND HCT 32-12.5 mg and then 32-25 mg. The maximal antihypertensive effect of any dose of ATACAND HCT can be expected within 4 weeks of initiating that dose. Patients with Renal Impairment: The usual regimens of "

Minor Dermal Procedures: For minor procedures such as intravenous cannulation and venipuncture, apply 2.5 grams of lidocaine and prilocaine cream, 2.5%/2.5% over 20 to 25 cm2 of skin surface for at least 1 hour. In controlled clinical trials using lidocaine and prilocaine cream, 2.5%/2.5%, two sites were usually prepared in case there was a technical problem with cannulation or venipuncture at the first site. Major Dermal Procedures: For more painful dermatological procedures involving a larger skin area such as split thickness skin graft harvesting, apply 2 grams of lidocaine and prilocaine cream, 2.5%/2.5% per 10 cm2 of skin and allow to remain in contact with the skin for at least 2 hours. Adult Male Genital Skin: As an adjunct prior to local anesthetic infiltration, apply a thick layer of lidocaine and prilocaine cream, 2.5%/2.5% (1 g/10 cm2) to the skin surface for 15 minutes. Local anesthetic infiltration should be performed immediately after removal of lidocaine and prilocaine cream, 2.5%/2.5%. Dermal analgesia can be expected to increase for up to 3 hours under occlusive dressing and persist for 1 to 2 hours after removal of the cream. The amount of lidocaine and prilocaine absorbed during the period of application can be estimated from the information in Table 2, ** footnote, in Individualization of Dose. Adult Female Patients-Genital Mucous Membranes For minor procedures on the female external genitalia, such as removal of condylomata acuminata, as well as for use as pretreatment for anesthetic infiltration, apply a thick layer (5-10 grams) of lidocaine and prilocaine cream, 2.5%/2.5% for 5 to 10 minutes. Occlusion is not necessary for absorption, but may be helpful to keep the cream in place. Patients should be lying down during the lidocaine and prilocaine cream, 2.5%/2.5% applic"

If no acute reaction occurs, then the regular dosage schedule may be followed. The following dose schedule is recommended: Squamous cell carcinoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, testicular carcinoma – 0.25 to 0.5 units/kg (10 to 20 units/m2) given intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously weekly or twice weekly. Hodgkin's Disease – 0.25 to 0.5 units/kg (10 to 20 units/m2) given intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously weekly or twice weekly. After a 50% response, a maintenance dose of 1 unit daily or 5 units weekly intravenously or intramuscularly should be given. Pulmonary toxicity of bleomycin for injection appears to be dose-related with a striking increase when the total dose is over 400 units. Total doses over 400 units should be given with great caution. Note: When bleomycin for injection is used in combination with other antineoplastic agents, pulmonary toxicities may occur at lower doses. Improvement of Hodgkin's disease and testicular tumors is prompt and noted within 2 weeks. If no improvement is seen by this time, improvement is unlikely. Squamous cell cancers respond more slowly, sometimes requiring as long as 3 weeks before any improvement is noted. Malignant Pleural Effusion – 60 units administered as a single dose bolus intrapleural injection (see ADMINISTRATION: Intrapleural ).

Striant® should be placed in a comfortable position just above the incisor tooth (on either side of the mouth). With each application, Striant® should be rotated to alternate sides of the mouth. Upon opening the packet, the rounded side surface of the buccal system should be placed against the gum and held firmly in place with a finger over the lip and against the product for 30 seconds to ensure adhesion. Striant® is designed to stay in position until removed. If the buccal system fails to properly adhere to the gum or should fall off during the 12-hour dosing interval, the old buccal system should be removed and a new one applied. If the buccal system falls out of position within 4 hours prior to the next dose, a new buccal system should be applied and it may remain in place until the time of next regularly scheduled dosing. Patients should take care to avoid dislodging the buccal system. Patients should check to see if Striant® is in place following toothbrushing, use of mouthwash and consumption of food or alcoholic/non-alcoholic beverages. Striant® should not be chewed or swallowed. To remove Striant®, gently slide it downwards from the gum towards the tooth to avoid scratching the gum."

Ropivacaine hydrochloride injection is not approved for this use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. The rapid injection of a large volume of local anesthetic solution should be avoided and fractional (incremental) doses should always be used. The smallest dose and concentration required to produce the desired result should be administered. The dose of any local anesthetic administered varies with the anesthetic procedure, the area to be anesthetized, the vascularity of the tissues, the number of neuronal segments to be blocked, the depth of anesthesia and degree of muscle relaxation required, the duration of anesthesia desired, individual tolerance, and the physical condition of the patient. Patients in poor general condition due to aging or other compromising factors such as partial or complete heart conduction block, advanced liver disease or severe renal dysfunction require special attention although regional anesthesia is frequently indicated in these patients. To reduce the risk of potentially serious adverse reactions, attempts should be made to optimize the patient's condition before major blocks are performed, and the dosage should be adjusted accordingly. Use an adequate test dose (3 mL to 5 mL of a short acting local anesthetic solution containing epinephrine) prior to induction of complete block. This test dose should be repeated if the patient is moved in such a fashion as to have displaced the epidural catheter. Allow adequate time for onset of anesthesia following administration of each test dose. These products are intended for single dose and are free from preservatives. Any solution remaining from an opened container should be discarded promptly. In addition"

The full blood pressure lowering effect was achieved 2 weeks after being on the maximal dose of Exforge HCT (2). 2.1 General Considerations Dose once-daily. The dosage may be increased after two weeks of therapy. The full blood pressure lowering effect was achieved 2 weeks after being on the maximal dose of Exforge HCT. The maximum recommended dose of Exforge HCT is 10/320/25 mg. Exforge HCT may be administered with or without food. No initial dosage adjustment is required for elderly patients. Renal impairment : The usual regimens of therapy with Exforge HCT may be followed if the patient’s creatinine clearance is >30 mL/min. In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides, so avoid use of Exforge HCT [see Impaired Renal Function (5.5)]. Hepatic impairment: Avoid Exforge HCT in patients with severe hepatic impairment. In patients with lesser degrees of hepatic impairment, monitor for worsening of hepatic or renal function and adverse reactions [see Impaired Hepatic Function (5.4)]. 2.2 Add-on / Switch Therapy Exforge HCT may be used for patients not adequately controlled on any two of the following antihypertensive classes: calcium channel blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, and diuretics. A patient who experiences dose-limiting adverse reactions to an individual component while on any dual combination of the components of Exforge HCT may be switched to Exforge HCT containing a lower dose of that component to achieve similar blood pressure reductions. 2.3 Replacement Therapy Exforge HCT may be substituted for the individually titr"

However, if severe symptoms are present, therapy should begin with metoclopramide injection (IM or IV). Doses of 10 mg may be administered slowly by the intravenous route over a 1- to 2-minute period. Administration of metoclopramide injection up to 10 days may be required before symptoms subside, at which time oral administration of metoclopramide may be instituted. The physician should make a thorough assessment of the risks and benefits prior to prescribing further metoclopramide treatment. For the Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated with Emetogenic Cancer Chemotherapy Intravenous infusions should be made slowly over a period of not less than 15 minutes, 30 minutes before beginning cancer chemotherapy and repeated every 2 hours for two doses, then every 3 hours for three doses. The initial two doses should be 2 mg/kg if highly emetogenic drugs such as cisplatin or dacarbazine are used alone or in combination. For less emetogenic regimens, 1 mg/kg per dose may be adequate. For doses in excess of 10 mg, metoclopramide injection should be diluted in 50 mL of a parenteral solution. The preferred parenteral solution is Sodium Chloride Injection (normal saline), which when combined with metoclopramide injection, can be stored frozen for up to 4 weeks. Metoclopramide injection is degraded when admixed and frozen with Dextrose-5% in Water. Metoclopramide injection diluted in Sodium Chloride Injection, Dextrose-5% in Water, Dextrose-5% in 0.45% Sodium Chloride, Ringer’s Injection, or Lactated Ringer’s Injection may be stored up to 48 hours (without freezing) after preparation if protected from light.

Do not use if the solution is colored or cloudy, or if it contains particulate matter. 2.2 Anaphylaxis Inject Adrenalin intramuscularly or subcutaneously into the anterolateral aspect of the thigh, through clothing if necessary. When administering to a child, to minimize the risk of injection related injury, hold the leg firmly in place and limit movement prior to and during an injection. The injection may be repeated every 5 to 10 minutes as necessary.

In clinical trials of bisoprolol fumarate/hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy using bisoprolol fumarate doses of 2.5 mg to 20 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25 mg to 25 mg, the antihypertensive effects increased with increasing doses of either component.The adverse effects (see WARNINGS) of bisoprolol fumarate are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily bradycardia, diarrhea, asthenia and fatigue) and dose-independent phenomena (eg, occasional rash); those of hydrochlorothiazide are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily hypokalemia) and dose-independent phenomena (eg, possibly pancreatitis); the dose-dependent phenomena for each being much more common than the dose-independent phenomena. The latter consist of those few that are truly idiosyncratic in nature or those that occur with such low frequency that a dose relationship may be difficult to discern. Therapy with a combination of bisoprolol fumarate and hydrochlorothiazide will be associated with both sets of dose-independent adverse effects, and to minimize these, it may be appropriate to begin combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy. On the other hand, regimens that combine low doses of bisoprolol fumarate and hydrochlorothiazide should produce minimal dose dependent adverse effects, eg, bradycardia, diarrhea, asthenia and fatigue, and minimal dose-dependent adverse metabolic effects, ie, decreases in serum potassium (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Therapy Guided by Clinical Effect A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with 2.5 mg to 20 mg bisoprolol fumarate daily may instead be given bisoprolol fumarate and hydrochlorothiazide.

No evidence of tolerance has been demonstrated in humans. Doses above 400 mg/day (600, 800, or 1000 mg/day) have not been shown to improve responses in dose-response studies in adults with partial onset seizures. It is not necessary to monitor topiramate plasma concentrations to optimize topiramate therapy. On occasion, the addition of topiramate to phenytoin may require an adjustment of the dose of phenytoin to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Addition or withdrawal of phenytoin and/or carbamazepine during adjunctive therapy with topiramate may require adjustment of the dose of topiramate. Because of the bitter taste, tablets should not be broken. Topiramate tablets can be taken without regard to meals. Monotherapy Use The recommended dose for topiramate monotherapy in adults and children 10 years of age and older is 400 mg/day in two divided doses. Approximately 58% of patients randomized to 400 mg/day achieved this maximal dose in the monotherapy controlled trial; the mean dose achieved in the trial was 275 mg/day.

Rivaroxaban tablets affects INR, so INR measurements made during coadministration with warfarin may not be useful for determining the appropriate dose of warfarin. One approach is to discontinue rivaroxaban tablets and begin both a parenteral anticoagulant and warfarin at the time the next dose of rivaroxaban tablets would have been taken. Once rivaroxaban tablets are discontinued, INR testing may be done reliably 24 hours after the last dose. Switching from Rivaroxaban"

IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. Situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient’s individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment. In this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of the corticosteroid for a period of time consistent with the patient’s condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. In pediatric patients, the initial dose of triamcinolone may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.11 to 1.6 mg/kg/day in 3 or 4 divided doses (3.2 to 48 mg/m2bsa/day).

The full antihypertensive effect is usually seen within 7 to 14 days. If the desired response is not achieved the dose can be doubled after 7 to 14 days. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg has not been shown to produce a statistically significant additional antihypertensive effect; but the 40-mg dose has been studied and is well tolerated. An increased effect (reduction) on heart rate should be anticipated with increasing dosage. If monotherapy with betaxolol does not produce the desired response, the addition of a diuretic agent or other antihypertensive should be considered (see, Drug Interactions). Dosage adjustments for specific patients Patients with renal failure In patients with renal impairment, clearance of betaxolol declines with decreasing renal function. In patients with severe renal impairment and those undergoing dialysis the initial dose of betaxolol is 5 mg once daily. If the desired response is not achieved, dosage may be increased by 5 mg/day increments every 2 weeks to a maximum dose of 20 mg/day. Patients with hepatic disease Patients with hepatic disease do not have significantly altered clearance. Dosage adjustments are not routinely needed. Elderly patients Consideration should be given to reduction in the starting dose to 5 mg in elderly patients. These patients are especially prone to beta-blocker-induced bradycardia, which appears to be dose related and sometimes responds to reductions in dose. Cessation of therapy If withdrawal of betaxolol therapy is planned, it should be achieved gradually over a period of about 2 weeks. Patients should be carefully observed and advised to limit physical activity to a minimum."

The dose of gonadotropins should be adjusted according to individual response. Cetrorelix Acetate for Injection 0.25 mg may be administered subcutaneously once daily during the early- to mid-follicular phase. Cetrorelix Acetate for Injection 0.25 mg is administered on either stimulation day 5 (morning or evening) or day 6 (morning) and continued daily until the day of hCG administration. When assessment by ultrasound shows a sufficient number of follicles of adequate size, hCG is administered to induce ovulation and final maturation of the oocytes. No hCG should be administered if the ovaries show an excessive response to the treatment with gonadotropins to reduce the chance of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Administration Cetrorelix Acetate for Injection 0.25 mg can be administered by the patient herself after appropriate instructions by her doctor. Directions for using Cetrorelix Acetate for Injection 0.25 mg with the enclosed needles and pre-filled syringe: Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water. Flip off the plastic cover of the vial and wipe the aluminum ring and the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab. Twist the injection needle with the yellow mark (20 gauge) on the pre-filled syringe. Push the needle through the center of the rubber stopper of the vial and slowly inject the solvent into the vial. Leaving the syringe in the vial, gently swirl the vial until the solution is clear and without residues. Avoid forming bubbles. Draw the total contents of the vial into the syringe. If necessary, invert the vial and pull back the needle as far as needed to withdraw the entire contents of the vial. Replace the needle with the yellow mark by the injection needle with the grey mark (27 gauge). Invert the syringe and push the plunger until all air bubbles have been expelled.

The dosage can be increased after 1 to 2 weeks of therapy to a maximum of one 10/320 mg tablet once daily as needed to control blood pressure. The majority of the antihypertensive effect is attained within 2 weeks after initiation of therapy or a change in dose. Amlodipine and valsartan tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. 2.2 Add-on Therapy A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with amlodipine (or another dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker) alone or with valsartan (or another ARB) alone may be switched to combination therapy with amlodipine and valsartan tablets. A patient who experiences dose-limiting adverse reactions on either component alone may be switched to amlodipine and valsartan tablets containing a lower dose of that component in combination with the other to achieve similar blood pressure reductions. The clinical response to amlodipine and valsartan tablets should be subsequently evaluated and if blood pressure remains uncontrolled after 3 to 4 weeks of therapy, the dose may be titrated up to a maximum of 10/320 mg. 2.3 Replacement Therapy For convenience, patients receiving amlodipine and valsartan from separate tablets may instead wish to receive tablets of amlodipine and valsartan containing the same component doses. 2.4 Initial Therapy A patient may be "

Other beverages (including mineral water), food, and some medications are likely to reduce the absorption of alendronate sodium tablets (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). Waiting less than 30 minutes, or taking alendronate sodium tablets with food, beverages (other than plain water) or other medications will lessen the effect of alendronate sodium tablets by decreasing its absorption into the body. Alendronate sodium tablets should only be taken upon arising for the day. To facilitate delivery to the stomach and thus reduce the potential for esophageal irritation, an alendronate sodium tablet should be swallowed with a full glass of water (6 - 8 oz). Patients should not lie down for at least 30 minutes and until after their first food of the day. Alendronate sodium tablets should not be taken at bedtime or before arising for the day. Failure to follow these instructions may increase the risk of esophageal adverse experiences (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients). Patients should receive supplemental calcium and vitamin D, if dietary intake is inadequate (see PRECAUTIONS, General). No dosage adjustment is necessary for the elderly or for patients with mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance 35 to 60 mL/min). Alendronate sodium tablets are not recommended for patients with more severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <35 mL/min) due to lack of experience. Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE) The recommended dosage is: one 70 mg tablet once weekly or one 10 mg tablet once daily Treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis The recommended dosage is: one 70 mg tablet once weekly or one 10 mg tablet once daily Prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal wom"

For the first cycle of a Sunday Start regimen, an additional method of contraception should be used until after the first 7 consecutive days of administration. Table 1: Instructions for Administration of JOLESSA Starting JOLESSA in females with no current use of hormonal contraception (Sunday Start) Important: Consider the possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of this product. Tablet Color: JOLESSA active tablets are pink (Day 1 to Day 84). JOLESSA inactive tablets are white (Day 85 to Day 91). Sunday Start: For each 91-day course, take in the following order: Take the first pink tablet (0.15 mg of levonorgestrel and 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol) on the first Sunday after the onset of menstruation. If menstruation begins on a Sunday, take the tablet on that day. Due to the potential risk of becoming pregnant, use additional non-hormonal contraception (such as condoms or spermicide) for the first 7 days of treatment. Take subsequent pink tablets once daily at the same time each day for a total of 84 days. Take one white tablet (inert) daily for the following 7 days and at the same time of day that active tablets were taken. A scheduled period should occur during the 7 days that the white tablets are taken. Begin the next and all subsequent 91-day courses of JOLESSA without interruption on the same day of the week (Sunday) on which the patient began her first dose.

A dose for inducing an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen is 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days. In cases of secondary amenorrhea, therapy may be started at any time. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing medroxyprogesterone acetate therapy. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Due to Hormonal Imbalance in the Absence of Organic Pathology Beginning on the calculated 16th or 21st day of the menstrual cycle, 5 or 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate may be given daily for 5 to 10 days. To produce an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen, 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 10 days beginning on the 16th day of the cycle is suggested. Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Patients with a past history of recurrent episodes of abnormal uterine bleeding may benefit from planned menstrual cycling with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Reduction of Endometrial Hyperplasia in Postmenopausal Women Receiving Daily 0.625 mg Conjugated Estrogens When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should also be initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (for example, 3 to 6 month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary ( see WARN"

In addition, if the solution changes color or becomes cloudy, it should not be used.Children 2 to 12 Years of Age: For children 2 to 12 years of age, initial dosing should be based upon body weight (0.1 to 0.15 mg/kg per dose), with subsequent dosing titrated to achieve the desired clinical response. Dosing should not exceed 2.5 mg three to four times daily by nebulization. The following table outlines approximate dosing according to body weight. Approximate Weight (kg) Approximate Weight (lb) Dose (mg) Volume of Inhalation Solution 10-1522-331.250.25 mL >15>332.50.5 mL The appropriate volume of the 0.5% inhalation solution should be diluted in sterile normal saline solution to a total volume of 3 mL prior to administration via nebulization.Adults and Children Over 12 Years of Age: The usual dosage for adults and children 12 years of age and older is 2.5 mg of albuterol administered three to four times daily by nebulization.More frequent administration or higher doses are not recommended. To administer 2.5 mg of albuterol, dilute 0.5 mL of the 0.5% inhalation solution with 2.5 mL of sterile normal saline solution.

It is important to increase dosage until symptoms are controlled. Dosage should be increased more gradually in debilitated or emaciated patients. In continued therapy, gradually reduce dosage to the lowest effective maintenance level, after symptoms have been controlled for a reasonable period. The 100 mg and 200 mg tablets are for use in severe neuropsychiatric conditions. Elderly Patients – In general, dosages in the lower range are sufficient for most elderly patients. Since they appear to be more susceptible to hypotension and neuromuscular reactions, such patients should be observed closely. Dosage should be tailored to the individual, response carefully monitored, and dosage adjusted accordingly. Dosage should be increased more gradually in elderly patients. Psychotic Disorders – Increase dosage gradually until symptoms are controlled. Maximum improvement may not be seen for weeks or even months. Continue optimum dosage for 2 weeks; then gradually reduce dosage to the lowest effective maintenance level. Daily dosage of 200 mg is not unusual. Some patients require higher dosages (e.g., 800 mg daily is not uncommon in discharged mental patients). Hospitalized Patients: Acute Schizophrenic or Manic States – It is recommended that initial treatment be with chlorpromazine HCI injection until patient is controlled. Usually patient becomes quiet and co-operative within 24 to 48 hours and oral doses may be substituted and increased until the patient is calm. 500 mg a day is generally sufficient. While gradual increases to 2,000 mg a day or more may be necessary, there is usually little therapeutic gain to be achieved by exceeding 1,000 mg a day for extended periods.

See WARNINGS. In patients unable to take oral Prograf capsules, therapy may be initiated with Prograf injection. The initial dose of Prograf should be administered no sooner than 6 hours after transplantation. The recommended starting dose of Prograf injection is 0.01 mg/kg/day (heart) or 0.03-0.05 mg/kg/day (liver, kidney) as a continuous IV infusion. Adult patients should receive doses at the lower end of the dosing range. Concomitant adrenal corticosteroid therapy is recommended early post-transplantation. Continuous IV infusion of Prograf injection should be continued only until the patient can tolerate oral administration of Prograf capsules. Preparation for Administration/Stability Prograf injection must be diluted with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection to a concentration between 0.004 mg/mL and 0.02 mg/mL prior to use. Diluted infusion solution should be stored in glass or polyethylene containers and should be discarded after 24 hours. The diluted infusion solution should not be stored in a PVC container due to decreased stability and the potential for extraction of phthalates. In situations where more dilute solutions are utilized (e.g., pediatric dosing, etc.), PVC-free tubing should likewise be used to minimize the potential for significant drug adsorption onto the tubing. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

Trichomoniasis In the Female One-day treatment— two grams of metronidazole, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses of one gram each given in the same day.Seven-day course of treatment— 250 mg three times daily for seven consecutive days. There is some indication from controlled comparative studies that cure rates as determined by vaginal smears, signs and symptoms, may be higher after a seven-day course of treatment than after a one-day treatment regimen.The dosage regimen should be individualized. Single-dose treatment can assure compliance, especially if administered under supervision, in those patients who cannot be relied on to continue the seven-day regimen. A seven-day course of treatment may minimize reinfection by protecting the patient long enough for the sexual contacts to obtain appropriate treatment. Further, some patients may tolerate one treatment regimen better than the other.Pregnant patients should not be treated during the first trimester. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS.) In pregnant patients in whom alternative treatment has been inadequate, the one-day course of therapy should not be used, as it results in higher serum levels which can reach the fetal circulation (see PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy).When repeat courses of the drug are required, it is recommended that an interval of four to six weeks elapse between courses and that the presence of the trichomonad be reconfirmed by appropriate laboratory measures. Total and differential leukocyte counts should be made before and after retreatment. In the Male Treatment should beindividualized as for the female.

Identification should be made either by direct microscopic examination of a mounting of infected tissue in a solution of potassium hydroxide or by culture on an appropriate medium.

Representative treatment periods are tinea capitis, 4 to 6 weeks; tinea corporis, 2 to 4 weeks; tinea pedis, 4 to 8 weeks; tinea unguium – depending on rate of growth – fingernails, at least 4 months; toenails, at least 6 months. General measures in regard to hygiene should be observed to control sources of infection or reinfection. Concomitant use of appropriate topical agents is usually required, particularly in treatment of tinea pedis. In some forms of tinea pedis, yeasts and bacteria may be involved as well as dermatophytes. Griseofulvin tablets, USP will not eradicate these associated bacterial or yeast infections. ADULTS: 0.5 g daily (125 mg q.i.d., 250 mg b.i.d., or 500 mg/day). Patients with less severe or 300 extensive infections may require less, whereas those with widespread lesions may require a starting dose of 0.75 g to 1 g/day. This may be reduced gradually to 0.5 g or less after a response has been noted. In all cases, the dosage should be individualized. PEDIATRIC PATIENTS (older than 2 years): A dosage of 10 mg/kg daily is usually adequate (pediatric patients from 30 to 50 lb, 125 mg to 250 mg daily; pediatric patients over 50 lb, 250 mg to 500 mg daily, in divided doses). Dosage should be individualized, as with adults. Clinical relapse will occur if the medication is not continued until the infecting organism is eradicated.

Blood pressure response is dose related over the range of 2 to 32 mg. The usual recommended starting dose of ATACAND is 16 mg once daily when it is used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume depleted. ATACAND can be administered once or twice daily with total daily doses ranging from 8 mg to 32 mg. Larger doses do not appear to have a greater effect, and there is relatively little experience with such doses. Most of the antihypertensive effect is present within 2 weeks, and maximal blood pressure reduction is generally obtained within 4 to 6 weeks of treatment with ATACAND. Use in Hepatic Impairment: Initiate with 8 mg ATACAND in patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency. Dosing recommendations cannot be provided for patients with severe hepatic insufficiency [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. ATACAND may be administered with or without food. If blood pressure is not controlled by ATACAND alone, a diuretic may be added. ATACAND may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. 2.2 Pediatric Hypertension 1 to < 17 Years of Age ATACAND may be administered once daily or divided into two equal doses.

Patients receiving 2 g/day of CellCept demonstrated an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 3 g/day of CellCept. Pediatrics (3 months to 18 years of age) The recommended dose of CellCept oral suspension is 600 mg/m2 administered twice daily (up to a maximum daily dose of 2 g/10 mL oral suspension). Patients with a body surface area of 1.25 m2 to 1.5 m2 may be dosed with CellCept capsules at a dose of 750 mg twice daily (1.5 g daily dose). Patients with a body surface area >1.5 m2 may be dosed with CellCept capsules or tablets at a dose of 1 g twice daily (2 g daily dose). Cardiac Transplantation Adults A dose of 1.5 g bid administered intravenously (over NO LESS THAN 2 HOURS) or 1.5 g bid oral (daily dose of 3 g) is recommended for use in adult cardiac transplant patients. Hepatic Transplantation Adults A dose of 1 g bid administered intravenously (over NO LESS THAN 2 HOURS) or 1.5 g bid oral (daily dose of 3 g) is recommended for use in adult hepatic transplant patients. CellCept Capsules, Tablets, and Oral Suspension The initial oral dose of CellCept should be given as soon as possible following renal, cardiac or hepatic transplantation. Food had no effect on MPA AUC, but has been shown to decrease MPA Cmax by 40%. Therefore, it is recommended that CellCept be administered on an empty stomach. However, in stable renal transplant patients, CellCept may be administered with food if necessary.

    "package_label": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION General It is recommended that bromocriptine mesylate tablets and capsules be taken with food. Patients should be evaluated frequently during dose escalation to determine the lowest dosage that produces a therapeutic response. Hyperprolactinemic Indications The initial dosage of bromocriptine mesylate tablets in adults is one-half to one 2.5 mg scored tablet daily. An additional 2.5 mg tablet may be added to the treatment regimen as tolerated every 2 to 7 days until an optimal therapeutic response is achieved. The therapeutic dosage ranged from 2.5 to 15 mg daily in adults studied clinically. Based on limited data in children of age 11 to 15, (see Pediatric Use subsection) the initial dose is one-half to one 2.5 mg scored tablet daily. Dosing may need to be increased as tolerated until a therapeutic response is achieved. The therapeutic dosage ranged from 2.5 to 10 mg daily in children with prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas. In order to reduce the likelihood of prolonged exposure to bromocriptine mesylate tablets or capsules should an unsuspected pregnancy occur, a mechanical contraceptive should be used in conjunction with bromocriptine therapy until normal ovulatory menstrual cycles have been restored. Contraception may then be discontinued in patients desiring pregnancy. Thereafter, if menstruation does not occur within 3 days of the expected date, bromocriptine therapy should be discontinued and a pregnancy test performed. Acromegaly Virtually all acromegalic patients receiving therapeutic benefit from bromocriptine mesylate tablets and capsules also have reductions in circulating levels of growth hormone. Therefore, periodic assessment of circulating levels of growth hormone will, in most cases, serve as a guide in determining the therapeutic potential of bromocriptine. If, after a brief trial with bromocriptine therapy, no significant reduction in growth hormone levels has taken place, careful assessment of the clinical features "

Atracurium should not be mixed in the same syringe, or administered simultaneously through the same needle, with alkaline solutions (e.g., barbiturate solutions). Atracurium besylate should be administered intravenously. DO NOT GIVE ATRACURIUM BESYLATE BY INTRAMUSCULAR ADMINISTRATION. Intramuscular administration of atracurium besylate may result in tissue irritation and there are no clinical data to support this route of administration. As with other neuromuscular blocking agents, the use of a peripheral nerve stimulator will permit the most advantageous use of atracurium besylate, minimizing the possibility of overdosage or underdosage, and assist in the evaluation of recovery. Bolus Doses for Intubation and Maintenance of Neuromuscular Block Adults An atracurium besylate dose of 0.4 to 0.5 mg/kg (1.7 to 2.2 times the ED95), given as an intravenous bolus injection, is the recommended initial dose for most patients. With this dose, good or excellent conditions for nonemergency intubation can be expected in 2 to 2.5 minutes in most patients, with maximum neuromuscular block achieved approximately 3 to 5 minutes after injection. Clinically required neuromuscular block generally lasts 20 to 35 minutes under balanced anesthesia. Under balanced anesthesia, recovery to 25% of control is achieved approximately 35 to 45 minutes after injection, and recovery is usually 95% complete approximately 60 minutes after injection. Atracurium is potentiated by isoflurane or enflurane anesthesia. The same initial atracurium besylate dose of 0.4 to 0.5 mg/kg may be used for intubation prior to administration of these inhalation agents; however, if atracurium is first administered under steady-state of isoflurane or enflurane, the initial atracurium besylate dose should be reduced by approximately one-third, i.e., to 0.25 to 0.35 mg/kg, to adjust fo"

If the headache returns, the dose may be repeated after 2 hours. The effectiveness of a second dose has not been established in placebo-controlled trials. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 10 mg in any 24-hour period. In controlled clinical trials, single doses of 5 mg of zolmitriptan nasal spray were administered into one nostril and were effective for the treatment of acute migraines in adults. Individuals may vary in response to ZOMIG Nasal Spray. The pharmacokinetics of a 5 mg nasal spray dose is similar to the 5 mg oral formulations. Doses lower than 5 mg can only be achieved through the use of an oral formulation. The choice of dose, and route of administration should therefore be made on an individual basis. The safety of treating an average of more than four headaches in a 30-day period has not been established. 2.2 Hepatic Impairment Patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment have decreased clearance of zolmitriptan and significant elevation in blood pressure was observed in some patients. Use of doses less than 2.5mg of an alternate formulation with blood pressure monitoring is recommended [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]."

    "package_label": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION There is considerable variation from patient to patient in the amount of medication required for treatment. As with all antipsychotic drugs, dosage should be individualized according to the needs and response of each patient. Dosage adjustments, either upward or downward, should be carried out as rapidly as practicable to achieve optimum therapeutic control. To determine the initial dosage, consideration should be given to the patient’s age, severity of illness, previous response to other antipsychotic drugs, and any concomitant medication or disease state. Children, debilitated or geriatric patients, as well as those with a history of adverse reactions to antipsychotic drugs, may require less haloperidol. The optimal response in such patients is usually obtained with more gradual dosage adjustments and at lower dosage levels, as recommended below. Clinical experience suggests the following recommendations: Oral Administration Inital Dosage Range Adults Moderate Symptomatology - 0.5 mg to 2 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. Severe Symptomatology - 3 mg to 5 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. To achieve prompt control, higher doses may be required in some cases. Geriatric or Debilitated Patients - 0.5 mg to 2 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. Chronic or Resistant Patients - 3 mg to 5 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. Patients who remain severely disturbed or inadequately controlled may require dosage adjustment. Daily dosages up to 100 mg may be necessary in some cases to achieve an optimal response. Infrequently haloperidol has been used in doses above 100 mg for severely resistant patients; however the limited clinical usage has not demonstrated the safety of prolonged administration of such doses. Children The following recommendations apply to children between the ages of 3 and 12 years (weight range 15 kg to 40 kg). Haloperidol is not intended for children under 3 years old. Therapy should begin at the lowest dose possible (0.5 mg per day). If required, the dose should be increased by an incr"

Patients should be chosen for therapy with clomiphene citrate only after careful diagnostic evaluation (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE). The plan of therapy should be outlined in advance. Impediments to achieving the goal of therapy must be excluded or adequately treated before beginning clomiphene citrate. The therapeutic objective should be balanced with potential risks and discussed with the patient and others involved in the achievement of a pregnancy. Ovulation most often occurs from 5 to 10 days after a course of clomiphene citrate. Coitus should be timed to coincide with the expected time of ovulation. Appropriate tests to determine ovulation may be useful during this time. Recommended Dosage Treatment of the selected patient should begin with a low dose, 50 mg daily (1 tablet) for 5 days. The dose should be increased only in those patients who do not ovulate in response to cyclic 50 mg clomiphene citrate. A low dosage or duration of treatment course is particularly recommended if unusual sensitivity to pituitary gonadotropin is suspected, such as in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (see WARNINGS; Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome). The patient should be evaluated carefully to exclude pregnancy, ovarian enlargement, or ovarian cyst formation between each treatment cycle. If progestin-induced bleeding is planned, or if spontaneous uterine bleeding occurs prior to therapy, the regimen of 50 mg daily for 5 days should be started on or about the 5th day of the cycle. Therapy may be started at any time in the patient who has had no recent uterine bleeding. When ovulation occurs at this dosage, there is no advantage to increasing the dose in subsequent cycles of treatment. If ovulation does not appear to occur after the first course of therapy, a s"

Consistent dose delivery is achieved, whether using the 40 or 80 mcg strengths, due to proportionality of the two products (i.e., two actuations of 40 mcg strength should provide a dose comparable to one actuation of the 80 mcg strength). QVAR should be administered by the oral inhaled route in patients 5 years of age and older. Use of QVAR with a spacer device in children less than 5 years of age is not recommended (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use). The onset and degree of symptom relief will vary in individual patients. Improvement in asthma symptoms should be expected within the first or second week of starting treatment, but maximum benefit should not be expected until 3-4 weeks of therapy. For patients who do not respond adequately to the starting dose after 3-4 weeks of therapy, higher doses may provide additional asthma control.

Naloxone, resuscitative and intubation equipment and oxygen should be readily available. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time ‎consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see WARNINGS]. ‎Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve ‎titration to higher doses of Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection ‎for patients in whom lower ‎doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of ‎using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.‎ There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to ‎adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual ‎patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see WARNINGS]. Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, ‎especially when initiating and following dosage increases with ‎Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection‎. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when ‎making dose adjustments [see WARNINGS].‎ Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Initial Dosage The usual recommended adult dose is 10 mg for a 70 kg individual administered subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously; this dose may be repeated every 3 to 6 hours as necessary. Use the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient's response to t"

The 50 mg dose is both a starting dose and the therapeutic dose. Desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets should be taken at approximately the same time each day. Tablets must be swallowed whole with fluid and not divided, crushed, chewed, or dissolved. In clinical studies, doses of 10 mg to 400 mg per day were studied. In clinical studies, doses of 50 mg to 400 mg per day were shown to be effective, although no additional benefit was demonstrated at doses greater than 50 mg per day and adverse reactions and discontinuations were more frequent at higher doses. The 25 mg per day dose is intended for a gradual reduction in dose when discontinuing treatment. When discontinuing therapy, gradual dose reduction is recommended whenever possible to minimize discontinuation symptoms [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. 2.2 Dosage Recommendations for Patients with Renal Impairment The maximum recommended dose in patients with moderate renal impairment (24-hr creatinine clearance [Cl Cr] = 30 to 50 mL/min, Cockcroft-Gault [C-G]) is 50 mg per day.

Potassium depletion sufficient to cause hypokalemia usually requires the loss of 200 or more mEq of potassium from the total body store. Dosage must be adjusted to the individual needs of each patient. The dose for the prevention of hypokalemia is typically in the range of 20 mEq per day. Doses of 40-100 mEq per day or more are used for the treatment of potassium depletion. Dosage should be divided if more than 20 mEq per day is given such that no more than 20 mEq is given in a single dose. Each Potassium Chloride Extended-release Tablet provides either 1500 mg of potassium chloride equivalent to 20 mEq of potassium or 750 mg of potassium chloride equivalent to 10 mEq of potassium. Potassium Chloride Extended-release Tablets should be taken with meals and with a glass of water or other liquid. This product should not be taken on an empty stomach because of its potential for gastric irritation (see WARNINGS ). Patients having difficulty swallowing whole tablets may try one of the following alternate methods of administration: a. Break the tablet in half and take each half separately with a glass of water. b. Prepare an aqueous (water) suspension as follows: Place the whole tablet(s) in approximately one-half glass of water (4 fluid ounces). Allow approximately 2 minutes for the tablet(s) to disintegrate. Stir for about half a minute after the tablet(s) has disintegrated. Swirl the suspension and consume the entire contents of the glass immediately by drinking or by the use of a straw. Add another one fluid ounce of water, swirl and consume immediately. Then, add an additional one fluid ounce of water, swirl and consume immediately. Aqueous suspension of Potassium Chloride Extended-release Tablet, USP that is not taken immediately should be discarded.

The dosage must be determined for each patient and adjusted according to the pattern of response. (2.1) Hemophilia A and von Willebrand's Disease (Type I): 0.3 mcg/kg (to a maximum of 20 mcg) administered by intravenous infusion. Dilute dose as appropriate. (2.1) See Full Prescribing Information for instructions on reconstitution, preparation, and administration (2). 2.1 Pretreatment Testing and On-Treatment Monitoring Diabetes Insipidus Prior to treatment with DDAVP, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality. Intermittently during treatment, assess serum sodium, urine volume and osmolality or plasma osmolality. Hemophilia A Prior to treatment with DDAVP Injection, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude the presence of factor VIII autoantibodies. Also assess serum sodium and aPTT prior to treatment. In certain clinical situations, it may be justified to try DDAVP in patients with factor VIII levels between 2% to 5%; however, these patients should be carefully monitored. von Willebrand's Disease (Type I) Prior to treatment with DDAVP Injection, verify that factor VIII coagulant activity levels are >5% and exclude severe von Willebrand's disease (Type I) and presence of abnormal molecular form of factor VIII antigen. During treatment with DDAVP Injection, assess serum sodium, bleeding time, factor VIII coagulant activity, ristocetin cofactor activity, and von Willebrand antigen to ensure that adequate levels are being achieved. For All Patients Receiving Repeated Doses: Restrict free water intake and monitor for hyponatremia. Ensure that serum sodium is normal prior to initiating or resuming treatment with DDAVP Injection. 2.2 Recommended Dosage Initiate fluid restriction during treatment with DDAVP Injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populati"

Patients with acute malaria are frequently averse to food. Patients should be encouraged to resume normal eating as soon as food can be tolerated since this improves absorption of artemether and lumefantrine. For patients who are unable to swallow the tablets such as infants and children, Coartem Tablets may be crushed and mixed with a small amount of water (1 to 2 teaspoons) in a clean container for administration immediately prior to use. The container can be rinsed with more water and the contents swallowed by the patient. The crushed tablet preparation should be followed whenever possible by food/drink (e.g., milk, formula, pudding, broth, and porridge). In the event of vomiting within 1 to 2 hours after administration, a repeat dose should be taken. If the repeat dose is vomited, the patient should be given an alternative antimalarial for treatment. 2.2 Dosage in Adult Patients (greater than 16 years of age) A 3-day treatment schedule with a total of 6 doses is recommended for adult patients with a bodyweight of 35 kg and above: Four tablets as a single initial dose, 4 tablets again after 8 hours, and "

Do not crush, chew, or sprinkle capsule contents on food (2.1) •Take dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules with or without food (2.1) 2.1 Dosing Information The starting dose for dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules is 120 mg twice a day orally. After 7 days, the dose should be increased to the maintenance dose of 240 mg twice a day orally. Temporary dose reductions to 120 mg twice a day may be considered for individuals who do not tolerate the maintenance dose. Within 4 weeks, the recommended dose of 240 mg twice a day should be resumed. Discontinuation of dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules should be considered for patients unable to tolerate return to the maintenance dose. The incidence of flushing may be reduced by administration of dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules with food. Alternatively, administration of non-enteric coated aspirin (up to a dose of 325 mg) 30 minutes prior to dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules dosing may reduce the incidence or severity of flushing [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules should be swallowed whole and intact. Dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules should not be crushed or chewed, and the capsule contents should not be sprinkled on food. Dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules can be taken with or without food. 2.2 Blood Tests Prior to Initiation of Therapy Obtain a complete blood cell count (CBC) including lymphocyte count before initiation of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. Obtain serum aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin levels prior to treatment with dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]."

Renal impairment: Not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min) (2.1, 5.8). Hypertension Not controlled on monotherapy: Initiate with 150/12.5 mg. Titrate to 300/12.5 mg then 300/25 mg if needed. One tablet daily (2.2). Replacement therapy: May be substituted for titrated components (2.3). Initial therapy: Initiate with 150/12.5 mg once daily for 1 to 2 weeks and titrate as needed up to maximum of 300/25 mg once daily (2.4). 2.1 General Considerations The side effects of irbesartan are generally rare and apparently independent of dose; those of hydrochlorothiazide are a mixture of dose-dependent (primarily hypokalemia) and dose-independent phenomena (eg, pancreatitis), the former much more common than the latter. [See Adverse Reactions (6) .] Maximum antihypertensive effects are attained within 2 to 4 weeks after a change in dose. AVALIDE may be administered with or without food. AVALIDE may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. Renal impairment. The usual regimens of therapy with AVALIDE may be followed as long as the patient's creatinine clearance is greater than 30 mL/min. In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides, so AVALIDE is not recommended. Hepatic impairment. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with hepatic impairment. 2.2 Add-On Therapy In patients not controlled on monotherapy with irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide, the recommended doses of AVALIDE, in order of increasing mean effect, are (irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide) 150/12.5 mg, 300/12.5 mg, and 300/25 mg. The largest incremental effect will likely be in the transition from monotherapy to 150/12.5 mg.

For Treatment of Tuberculosis - Isoniazid is used in conjunction with other effective anti-tuberculosis agents. Drug susceptibility testing should be performed on the organisms initially isolated from all patients with newly diagnosed tuberculosis. If the bacilli becomes resistant, therapy must be changed to agents to which the bacilli are susceptible. Usual Oral Dosage (depending on the regimen used): Adults: 5 mg/kg up to 300 mg daily in a single dose; or 15 mg/kg up to 900 mg day, two or three times/week Children: 10-15 mg/kg up to 300 mg daily in a single dose; or 20-40 mg/kg up to 900 mg/day, two or three time/week Patients with Pulmonary Tuberculosis Without HIV Infection There are 3 regimen options for the initial treatment of tuberculosis in children and adults: Option 1: Daily isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide for 8 weeks followed by 16 weeks of isoniazid and rifampin daily or 2-3 times weekly. Ethambutol or streptomycin should be added to the initial regimen until sensitivity to isoniazid and rifampin is demonstrated. The addition of a fourth drug is optional if the relative prevalence of isoniazid-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in the community is less than or equal to four percent. Option 2: Daily isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and streptomycin or ethambutol for 2 weeks followed by twice weekly administration of the same drugs for 6 weeks, subsequently twice weekly isoniazid and rifampin for 16 weeks.

Studies comparing fluoxetine 20, 40, and 60 mg/day to placebo indicate that 20 mg/day is sufficient to obtain a satisfactory response in Major Depressive Disorder in most cases. Consequently, a dose of 20 mg/day, administered in the morning, is recommended as the initial dose. A dose increase may be considered after several weeks if insufficient clinical improvement is observed. Doses above 20 mg/day may be administered on a once-a-day (morning) or BID schedule (i.e., morning and noon) and should not exceed a maximum dose of 80 mg/day.

Dosage should be determined by susceptibility of the causative organisms, severity of infection, and the condition of the patient (see Table 1 for dosage guidelines). If C. trachomatis is a suspected pathogen, appropriate anti-chlamydial coverage should be added, because cefoxitin sodium has no activity against this organism. Cefoxitin for Injection may be used in patients with reduced renal function with the following dosage adjustments: In adults with renal insufficiency, an initial loading dose of 1 gram to 2 grams may be given. After a loading dose, the recommendations for maintenance dosage (Table 2) may be used as a guide. When only the serum creatinine level is available, the following formula (based on sex, weight, and age of the patient) may be used to convert this value into creatinine clearance. The serum creatinine should represent a steady state of renal function. Males: Weight (kg) x (140-age) 72 x serum creatinine (mg/100 mL) Females: 0.85 x above value In patients undergoing hemodialysis, the loading dose of 1 gram to 2 grams should be given after each hemodialysis, and the maintenance dose should be given as indicated in Table 2. Antibiotic therapy for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections should be maintained for at least 10 days to guard against the risk of rheumatic fever or glomerulonephritis. In staphylococcal and other infections involving a collection of pus, surgical drainage should be carried out where indicated. Pediatric Patients The recommended dosage in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older is 80 to 160 mg/kg of body weight per day divided into four to six equal doses. The higher dosages should be used for more severe or serious infections. The total daily dosage should not exceed 12 grams. At this time"

The dose may be increased up to 40 mg once daily with food after a minimum of 7 days between dosage increases. If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as the patient remembers. If it is almost time for the next dose, the patient should skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the regular time. Two doses should not be taken at the same time. 2.2 Screen for Bipolar Disorder Prior to Starting V ilazodone Prior to initiating treatment with vilazodone or another antidepressant, screen patients for a personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . 2. 3 Switching t o or f rom a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor Antidepressant At least 14 days must elapse between discontinuation of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) antidepressant and initiation of vilazodone.

In cardiac arrest, a rapid intravenous dose of one to two 50 mL vials (44.6 to 100 mEq) may be given initially and continued at a rate of 50 mL (44.6 to 50 mEq) every 5 to 10 minutes if necessary (as indicated by arterial pH and blood gas monitoring) to reverse the acidosis. Caution should be observed in emergencies where very rapid infusion of large quantities of bicarbonate is indicated. Bicarbonate solutions are hypertonic and may produce an undesirable rise in plasma sodium concentration in the process of correcting the metabolic acidosis. In cardiac arrest, however, the risks from acidosis exceed those of hypernatremia. In less urgent forms of metabolic acidosis, Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP may be added to other intravenous fluids, The amount of bicarbonate to be given to older children and adults over a four-to-eight- hour period is approximately 2 to 5 mEq/kg of body weight - depending upon the severity of the acidosis as judged by the lowering of total CO2 content, blood pH and clinical condition of the patient. In metabolic acidosis associated with shock, therapy should be monitored by measuring blood gases, plasma osmolarity, arterial blood lactate, hemodynamics and cardiac rhythm. Bicarbonate therapy should always be planned in a stepwise fashion since the degree of response from a given dose is not precisely predictable. Initially an infusion of 2 to 5 mEq/kg body weight over a period of 4 to 8 hours will produce a measurable improvement in the abnormal acid-base status of the blood. The next step of therapy is dependent upon the clinical response of the patient. If severe symptoms have abated, then the frequency of administration and the size of the dose may be reduced. In general, it is unwise to attempt full correction of a low total CO2 content during the first 24 hours of therapy, since this may be accompanied by an unrecognized alkalosis beca"

Since the maximal effect of a given dose is seen within 4 weeks, periodic lipid determinations should be performed at this time and dosage adjusted according to the patient’s response to therapy and established treatment guidelines. Adult Patients The recommended starting dose is 40 mg once daily. If a daily dose of 40 mg does not achieve desired cholesterol levels, 80 mg once daily is recommended. In patients with a history of significant renal or hepatic dysfunction, a starting dose of 10 mg daily is recommended. Pediatric Patients Children (Ages 8 to 13 Years, Inclusive) The recommended dose is 20 mg once daily in children 8 to 13 years of age. Doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population. Adolescents (Ages 14 to 18 Years) The recommended starting dose is 40 mg once daily in adolescents 14 to 18 years of age. Doses greater than 40 mg have not been studied in this patient population.Children and adolescents treated with pravastatin should be reevaluated in adulthood and appropriate changes made to their cholesterol-lowering regimen to achieve adult goals for LDL-C (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Hyperlipidemia: Table 7: NCEP Treatment Guidelines).In patients taking immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporine (see WARNINGS: Skeletal Muscle) concomitantly with pravastatin, therapy should begin with 10 mg of pravastatin sodium once-a-day at bedtime and titration to higher doses should be done with caution. Most patients treated with this combination received a maximum pravastatin sodium dose of 20 mg/day. Concomitant Therapy The lipid-lowering effe"

After 1 week, increase the daily dose to 0.3 mL/kg (1.1 mg/kg) twice daily. After 2 weeks of treatment, increase the dose to 0.4 mL/kg (1.7 mg/kg) twice daily and maintain this for 6 months. Readjust the dose periodically as the child’s weight increases. To reduce the risk of hypoglycemia, administer HEMANGEOL orally during or right after a feeding. Skip the dose if the child is not eating or is vomiting [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Monitor heart rate and blood pressure for 2 hours after HEMANGEOL initiation or dose increases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. If hemangiomas recur, treatment may be re-initiated [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . HEMANGEOL is supplied with an oral dosing syringe for administration. Administration directly into the child’s mouth is recommended. Nevertheless, if necessary, the product may be diluted in a small quantity of milk or fruit juice, given in a baby’s bottle. Table 1.

Dosage of metformin must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance, while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily doses. The maximum recommended daily dose of metformin is 2550 mg in adults and 2000 mg in pediatric patients (10-16 years of age).Metformin should be given in divided doses with meals and should be started at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation, both to reduce gastrointestinal side effects and to permit identification of the minimum dose required for adequate glycemic control of the patient.During treatment initiation and dose titration (see Recommended Dosing Schedule), fasting plasma glucose should be used to determine the therapeutic response to metformin and identify the minimum effective dose for the patient. Thereafter, glycosylated hemoglobin should be measured at intervals of approximately three months. The therapeutic goal should be to decrease both fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels to normal or near normal by using the lowest effective dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets, either when used as monotherapy or in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin.Monitoring of blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin will also permit detection of primary failure, i.e., inadequate lowering of blood glucose at the maximum recommended dose of medication, and secondary failure, i.e., loss of an adequate blood glucose lowering response after an initial period of effectiveness.Short-term administration of metformin may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control in patients usually well-controlled on diet alone. Recommended Dosing Schedule Adults In general, clinically significant responses are not seen at doses below 1500 mg per day.

Further increases in the dose of AVANDIA should be accompanied by careful monitoring for adverse events related to fluid retention [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. AVANDIA may be administered at a starting dose of 4 mg either as a single daily dose or in 2 divided doses. For patients who respond inadequately following 8 to 12 weeks of treatment, as determined by reduction in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), the dose may be increased to 8 mg daily as monotherapy or in combination with metformin, sulfonylurea, or sulfonylurea plus metformin. Reductions in glycemic parameters by dose and regimen are described under Clinical Studies (14.1). AVANDIA may be taken with or without food. The total daily dose of AVANDIA should not exceed 8 mg. 2.1 MonotherapyThe usual starting dose of AVANDIA is 4 mg administered either as a single dose once daily or in divided doses twice daily. In clinical trials, the 4-mg twice-daily regimen resulted in the greatest reduction in FPG and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). 2.2 Combination With Sulfonylurea or MetforminWhen AVANDIA is added to existing therapy, the current dose(s) of the agent(s) can be continued upon initiation of therapy with AVANDIA. Sulfonylurea When used in combination with sulfonylurea, the usual starting dose of AVANDIA is 4 mg administered as either a single dose once daily or in divided doses twice daily. If patients report hypoglycemia, the dose of the sulfonylurea should be decreased. Metformin The usual starting dose of AVANDIA in combination with metformin is 4 mg administered as either a single dose once daily or in divided doses twice daily. It is unlikely that the dose of metformin will require adjustment due to hypoglycemia during combination therapy with AVANDIA. 2.3 Combination With Sulfonylurea Plus MetforminThe usual starting dose of AVANDI"

Wash hands thoroughly after application. Apply a thin layer of TAZORAC Gel only to the affected area once daily in the evening. (2.1, 2.2) Not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use. (2.2) If contact with eyes occurs, rinse thoroughly with water. (2.2) 2. 1 Psoriasis It is recommended that treatment starts with TAZORAC Gel, 0.05%, with strength increased to 0.1% if tolerated and medically indicated. Apply a thin film (2 mg/cm2) of TAZORAC Gel once per day, in the evening, to cover only the psoriatic lesions on no more than 20% of body surface area. If a bath or shower is taken prior to application, the skin should be dry before applying the gel. If emollients are used, they should be applied at least an hour before application of TAZORAC Gel. Because unaffected skin may be more susceptible to irritation, application of tazarotene to these areas should be carefully avoided. TAZORAC Gel was investigated for up to 12 months during clinical trials for psoriasis. 2. 2 Acne Cleanse the face gently. After the skin is dry, apply a thin layer (2 mg/cm2) of TAZORAC Gel 0.1% once per day, in the evening, to the skin where acne lesions appear. Use enough to cover the entire affected area. TAZORAC Gel was investigated for up to 12 weeks during clinical trials for acne. Use effective sunscreens and wear protective clothing while using TAZORAC Gel [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]."

When used in combination with other anticancer drugs, the Matulane dose should be appropriately reduced, eg, in the MOPP regimen, the Matulane dose is 100 mg/m2 daily for 14 days. All dosages are based on the patient's actual weight. However, the estimated lean body mass (dry weight) is used if the patient is obese or if there has been a spurious weight gain due to edema, ascites or other forms of abnormal fluid retention. Adults:To minimize the nausea and vomiting experienced by a high percentage of patients beginning Matulane therapy, single or divided doses of 2 to 4 mg/kg/day for the first week are recommended. Daily dosage should then be maintained at 4 to 6 mg/kg/day until maximum response is obtained or until the white blood count falls below 4000/cmm or the platelets fall below 100,000/ cmm. When maximum response is obtained, the dose may be maintained at 1 to 2 mg/kg/day. Upon evidence of hematologic or other toxicity (see PRECAUTIONS section), the drug should be discontinued until there has been satisfactory recovery. After toxic side effects have subsided, therapy may then be resumed at the discretion of the physician, based on clinical evaluation and appropriate laboratory studies, at a dosage of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day. Pediatric Patients:Very close clinical monitoring is mandatory. Undue toxicity, evidenced by tremors, coma and convulsions, has occurred in a few cases. Dosage, therefore, should be individualized. The following dosage schedule is provided as a guideline only. Fifty (50) mg per square meter of body surface per day is recommended for the first week. Dosage should then be maintained at 100 mg per square meter of body surface per day until maximum response is obtained or until leukopenia or thrombocytopenia occurs. When maximum response is attained, the dose may be maintained at 50 mg per square meter of body surface per day. Upon evidence of hemato"

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The starting dose should be individualized based on the type of diabetes and whether the patient is insulin-naïve (2.1, 2.2, 2.3) Administer subcutaneously once daily at any time of day, but at the same time every day. (2.1) Rotate injection sites within an injection area (abdomen, thigh, or deltoid) to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy. (2.1) Converting from other insulin therapies may require adjustment of timing and dose of LANTUS. Closely monitor glucoses especially upon converting to LANTUS and during the initial weeks thereafter. (2.3) 2.1 Dosing LANTUS is a recombinant human insulin analog for once daily subcutaneous administration with potency that is approximately the same as the potency of human insulin. LANTUS exhibits a relatively constant glucose-lowering profile over 24 hours that permits once-daily dosing. LANTUS may be administered at any time during the day. LANTUS should be administered subcutaneously once a day at the same time every day. The dose of LANTUS must be individualized based on clinical response. Blood glucose monitoring is essential in all patients receiving insulin therapy. Patients adjusting the amount or timing of dosing with LANTUS, should only do so under medical supervision with appropriate glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) .] In patients with type 1 diabetes, LANTUS must be used in regimens with short-acting insulin. The intended duration of activity of LANTUS is dependent on injection into subcutaneous tissue [see Clinical pharmacology (12.2)]. LANTUS should not be administered intravenously or via an insulin pump. Intravenous administration of the usual subcutaneous dose could result in severe hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. As with all insulins, injection sites should be rotated within the same region (abdomen, thigh, or deltoid) from one injection to the next to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy [See Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In clinical studies, there was no"

The free acid form of phenytoin is used in Phenytoin Oral Suspension. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. General Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments—the clinically effective serum level is usually 10–20 mcg/mL. With recommended dosage, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve steady-state blood levels with phenytoin and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days. Adult Dose Patients who have received no previous treatment may be started on one teaspoonful (5 mL) of Phenytoin Oral Suspension three times daily, and the dose is then adjusted to suit individual requirements. An increase to five teaspoonfuls daily may be made, if necessary. Pediatric Dose Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dose (300 mg/day)."

Seizure Disorders Adults: The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response. Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg.The use of multiple anticonvulsants may result in an increase of depressant adverse effects. This should be considered before adding clonazepam to an existing anticonvulsant regimen.Pediatric Patients: Clonazepam is administered orally. In order to minimize drowsiness, the initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/day but not to exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in two or three divided doses. Dosage should be increased by no more than 0.25 to 0.5 mg every third day until a daily maintenance dose of 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg of body weight has been reached, unless seizures are controlled or side effects preclude further increase. Whenever possible, the daily dose should be divided into three equal doses. If doses are not equally divided, the largest dose should be given before retiring.Geriatric Patients: There is no clinical trial experience with clonazepam in seizure disorder patients 65 years of age and older. In general, elderly patients should be started on low doses of clonazepam and observed closely (seePRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use). Panic Disorder Adults: The initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg bid. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days. The recommended dose of 1 mg/day is based on the results from a fixed dose study in which the optimal effect was seen at 1 mg/day. Higher doses of 2"

After titration, tramadol hydrochloride 50 mg to 100 mg can be administered as needed for pain relief every four to six hours, not to exceed 400 mg per day.For the subset of patients for whom rapid onset of analgesic effect is required and for whom the benefits outweigh the risk of discontinuation due to adverse events associated with higher initial doses, tramadol hydrochloride 50 mg to 100 mg can be administered as needed for pain relief every four to six hours, not to exceed 400 mg per day.. Individualization of Dose Good pain management practice dictates that the dose be individualized according to patient need using the lowest beneficial dose. Studies with tramadol in adults have shown that starting at the lowest possible dose and titrating upwards will result in fewer discontinuations and increased tolerability.In all patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min, it is recommended that the dosing interval of tramadol hydrochloride be increased to 12 hours, with a maximum daily dose of 200 mg. Since only 7% of an administered dose is removed by hemodialysis, dialysis patients can receive their regular dose on the day of dialysis.The recommended dose for adult patients with cirrhosis is 50 mg every 12 hours.In general, dose selection for an elderly patient over 65 years old should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. For elderly patients over 75 years old, total dose should not exceed 300 mg/day."

The usual dosage range of enalapril is 10 to 40 mg per day administered in a single or two divided doses; hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 to 50 mg daily. The side effects (see WARNINGS ) of enalapril are generally rare and apparently independent of dose; those of hydrochlorothiazide are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily hypokalemia) and dose-independent phenomena (e.g., pancreatitis), the former much more common than the latter. Therapy with any combination of enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide will be associated with both sets of dose-independent side effects but the addition of enalapril in clinical trials blunted the hypokalemia normally seen with diuretics. To minimize dose-independent side effects, it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy. Dose Titration Guided by Clinical Effect A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with either enalapril or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy may be given enalapril maleate/hydrochlorothiazide 5/12.5 or enalapril maleate/hydrochlorothiazide 10/25. Further increases of enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide or both depend on clinical response. The hydrochlorothiazide dose should generally not be increased until 2-3 weeks have elapsed. In general, patients do not require doses in excess of 20 mg of enalapril or 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. The daily dosage should not exceed four tablets of enalapril maleate/hydrochlorothiazide 5/12.5 or two tablets of enalapril maleate/hydrochlorothiazide 10/25. Replacement Therapy The combination may be substituted for the titrated components.

In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides, so Diovan HCT is not recommended. Hepatic impairment : Care should be exercised with dosing of Diovan HCT in patients with hepatic impairment. Start with a low dose and titrate slowly in patients with hepatic impairment [s ee Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 2.2 Add-On Therapy A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with valsartan (or another ARB) alone or hydrochlorothiazide alone may be switched to combination therapy with Diovan HCT. A patient who experiences dose-limiting adverse reactions on either component alone may be switched to Diovan HCT containing a lower dose of that component in c"

Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS). After observing the response to initial therapy with Indomethacin, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient’s needs. Indomethacin is available as 25 and 50 mg capsules. Adverse reactions appear to correlate with the size of the dose of Indomethacin in most patients but not all. Therefore, every effort should be made to determine the smallest effective dosage for the individual patient. Pediatric Use Indomethacin ordinarily should not be prescribed for pediatric patients 14 years of age and under (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use). Adult Use Dosage Recommendations for Active Stages of the Following: 1. Moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis including acute flares of chronic disease; moderate to severe ankylosing spondylitis; and moderate to severe osteoarthritis. Suggested Dosage: Indomethacin capsules 25 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. If this is well tolerated, increase the daily dosage by 25 or by 50 mg, if required by continuing symptoms, at weekly intervals until a satisfactory response is obtained or until a total daily dose of 150 to 200 mg is reached. DOSES ABOVE THIS AMOUNT GENERALLY DO NOT INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DRUG. In patients who have persistent night pain and/or morning stiffness, the giving of a large portion, up to a maximum of 100 mg, of the total daily dose at bedtime, may be helpful in affording relief. The total daily dose should not exceed 200 mg. In acute flares of chronic rheumatoid arthritis, it may be necessary to increase the dosage by 25 mg or, if required, by 50 mg daily. If minor adverse effects develop as the dosage is increased, reduce the dosage rapidly to a tolerated dose and OBSERVE THE PATIENT CLOSELY. If severe adverse reacti"

If such circumstances are suspected to be present, the initial starting dose should be 1.25 mg once daily. Hypertension The recommended initial dose for patients not receiving a diuretic is 2.5 mg once a day. Dosage should be adjusted according to the blood pressure response. The usual maintenance dosage range is 2.5 to 20 mg per day administered as a single dose or in two equally divided doses. In some patients treated once daily, the antihypertensive effect may diminish toward the end of the dosing interval. In such patients, an increase in dosage or twice daily administration should be considered. If blood pressure is not controlled with ramipril alone, a diuretic can be added.After the initial dose of ramipril, the patient should be observed under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions.) If possible, the dose of any concomitant diuretic should be reduced which may diminish the likelihood of hypotension. The appearance of hypotension after the initial dose of ramipril does not preclude subsequent careful dose titration with the drug, following effective management of the hypotension.The ramipril capsule is usually swallowed whole. The ramipril capsule can also be opened and the contents sprinkled on a small amount (about 4 oz.) of apple sauce or mixed in 4 oz. (120 ml) of water or apple juice. To be sure that ramipril is not lost when such a mixture is used, the mixture should be consumed in its entirety. The described mixtures can be pre-prepared and stored for up to 24 hours at room temperature or up to 48 hours under refrigeration.Concomitant administration of ramipril with potassium supplements, p"

(2.2) • Geriatric Patients: The starting doses should be decreased by 50% in elderly patients (> 65 years). (2.6) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression when initiating therapy and following dosage increases with ULTIVA and adjust the dosage accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. ULTIVA is for IV use only. Continuous infusions of ULTIVA should be administered only by an infusion device. The injection site should be close to the venous cannula and all IV tubing should be cleared at the time of discontinuation of infusion. ULTIVA should not be administered without dilution. Consider an alternative to ULTIVA for patients taking mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist opioid analgesics due to reduced analgesic effect or potential withdrawal symptoms. If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue ULTIVA if patient is not responding appropriately to treatment. Discard unused portion. 2.2 General Anesthesia ULTIVA is not recommended as the sole agent in general anesthesia because loss of consciousness cannot be assured and because of a high incidence of apnea, muscle rigidity, and tachycardia. ULTIVA is synergistic with other anesthetics; therefore, clinicians may need to reduce doses of thiopental, propofol, isoflurane, and midazolam by up to 75% with the coadministration of ULTIVA. The administration of ULTIVA must be individualized based on the patient's response. Induction of Anesthesia ULTIVA sho"

Special dosage adjustment in the elderly is not necessary.Because of the high bioavailability of DEMADEX, oral and intravenous doses are therapeutically equivalent, so patients may be switched to and from the intravenous form with no change in dose. DEMADEX intravenous injection should be administered either slowly as a bolus over a period of 2 minutes or administered as a continuous infusion.If DEMADEX is administered through an IV line, it is recommended that, as with other IV injections, the IV line be flushed with Normal Saline (Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) before and after administration. DEMADEX injection is formulated above pH 8.3. Flushing the line is recommended to avoid the potential for incompatibilities caused by differences in pH which could be indicated by color change, haziness or the formation of a precipitate in the solution.If DEMADEX is administered as a continuous infusion, stability has been demonstrated through 24 hours at room temperature in plastic containers for the following fluids and concentrations:200 mg DEMADEX (10 mg/mL) added to: 250 mL Dextrose 5% in water 250 mL 0.9% Sodium Chloride 500 mL 0.45% Sodium Chloride50 mg DEMADEX (10 mg/mL) added to: 500 mL Dextrose 5% in water 500 mL 0.9% Sodium Chloride 500 mL 0.45% Sodium ChlorideBefore administration, the solution of DEMADEX should be visually inspected for discoloration and particulate matter. If either is found, the ampul should not be used. Congestive Heart Failure The usual initial dose is 10 mg or 20 mg of once-daily oral or intravenous DEMADEX. If the diuretic response is inadequate, the dose should be titrated upward by approximately doubling until the desired diuretic response is obtained. Single doses higher than 200 mg have not been adequately studied. Chronic Renal Failure The usual initial dose of DEMADEX is 20 mg of once-daily oral or intravenous DEMADEX. If"

Recommended Dosage: •ALL: 20 mg/m2 one time weekly (2.2). •pJIA: Starting dose of 10 mg/m2 one time weekly (2.3). 2.1 Important Administration Information XATMEP is intended for oral use only. Use another formulation of methotrexate for alternative dosing in patients who require dosing via other routes of administration. Instruct patients and caregivers that the recommended dose should be taken weekly, as directed, and that mistaken daily use of the recommended dose has led to fatal toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.15 ), Overdosage (10)]. It is important that XATMEP be measured with an accurate measuring device [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.15 ), Patient Counseling Information (17)]. A household teaspoon is not an accurate measuring device. A pharmacist can provide an appropriate device and can provide instructions for measuring the correct dose. 2.2 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia The recommended starting dose of XATMEP, in multi-agent combination chemotherapy maintenance regimens, is 20 mg/m2 given one time weekly. After initiating XATMEP, continuation of appropriate dosing requires periodic monitoring of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and platelet count to assure sufficient drug exposure (that is to maintain ANC at a desirable level) and to adjust for excessive hematological toxicity. 2.3 Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis The recommended starting dose of XATMEP is 10 mg/m2 given one time weekly. Dosages should be tailored to the individual patient and adjusted gradually to achieve an optimal response. Although there is experience with doses up to 30 mg/m2/week in pediatric patients, doses greater than 20 mg/m2/week may result in a significant increase in the incidence and severity of serious toxic reactions, especially bone marrow suppression.

Dosage should be adjusted to the needs of the individual patient. A low initial daily dosage with a gradual increase is advised. As soon as adequate control is achieved, the dosage may be reduced very gradually to the minimum effective level. Medication should be taken with meals.Conversion of patients from oral carbamazepine tablets to carbamazepine suspension: Patients should be converted by administering the same number of mg per day in smaller, more frequent doses (i.e., b.i.d. tablets to t.i.d. suspension). Epilepsy (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE) Adults and children over 12 years of age - Initial: 200 mg b.i.d. Increase at weekly intervals by adding up to 200 mg/day using a t.i.d. or q.i.d. regimen until the optimal response is obtained. Dosage generally should not exceed 1000 mg daily in children 12-15 years of age, and 1200 mg daily in patients above 15 years of age. Doses up to 1600 mg daily have been used in adults in rare instances. Maintenance: Adjust dosage to the minimum effective level, usually 800-1200 mg daily. Children 6-12 years of age - Initial: 100 mg b.i.d. Increase at weekly intervals by adding up to 100 mg/day using a t.i.d. or q.i.d. regimen until the optimal response is obtained. Dosage generally should not exceed 1000 mg daily. Maintenance: Adjust dosage to the minimum effective level, usually 400-800 mg daily. Children under 6 years of age - Initial: 10-20 mg/kg/day b.i.d. or t.i.d. Increase weekly to achieve optimal clinical response administered t.i.d. or q.i.d. Maintenance: Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 35 mg/kg.

    "package_label": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hypertension The recommended initial dosage of MAVIK for patients not receiving a diuretic is 1 mg once daily in non-black patients and 2 mg in black patients. Dosage should be adjusted according to the blood pressure response. Generally, dosage adjustments should be made at intervals of at least 1 week. Most patients have required dosages of 2 to 4 mg once daily. There is little clinical experience with doses above 8 mg. Patients inadequately treated with once-daily dosing at 4 mg may be treated with twice-daily dosing. If blood pressure is not adequately controlled with MAVIK monotherapy, a diuretic may be added. In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic hypotension occasionally can occur following the initial dose of MAVIK. To reduce the likelihood of hypotension, the diuretic should, if possible, be discontinued two to three days prior to beginning therapy with MAVIK. (see WARNINGS.) Then, if blood pressure is not controlled with MAVIK alone, diuretic therapy should be resumed. If the diuretic cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 0.5 mg MAVIK should be used with careful medical supervision for several hours until blood pressure has stabilized. The dosage should subsequently be titrated (as described above) to the optimal response. (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS and DRUG INTERACTIONS.) Concomitant administration of MAVIK with potassium supplements, potassium salt substitutes, or potassium sparing diuretics can lead to increases of serum potassium. (see PRECAUTIONS.) Heart Failure Post Myocardial Infarction or Left-Ventricular Dysfunction Post Myocardial Infarction The recommended starting dose is 1 mg, once daily. Following the initial dose, all patients should be titrated (as tolerated) toward a target dose of 4 mg, once daily. If a 4 mg dose is not tolerated, patients can continue therapy with the greatest tolerated dose. Dosage Adjustment in Renal Impairment or Hepatic Cirrhosis For patients with a cre"

The RDA for calcium in adults is 800 mg. To ensure that each patient receives an adequate daily intake of calcium, the physician should either prescribe a calcium supplement or instruct the patient in proper dietary measures.The recommended initial dose of Calcitriol Injection, depending on the severity of the hypocalcemia and/or secondary hyperparathyroidism, is 1 mcg (0.02 mcg/kg) to 2 mcg administered three times weekly, approximately every other day. Doses as small as 0.5 mcg and as large as 4 mcg three times weekly have been used as an initial dose. If a satisfactory response is not observed, the dose may be increased by 0.5 to 1 mcg at two to four week intervals. During this titration period, serum calcium and phosphorus levels should be obtained at least twice weekly. If hypercalcemia or a serum calcium times phosphate product greater than 70 is noted, the drug should be immediately discontinued until these parameters are appropriate. Then, the Calcitriol Injection dose should be reinitiated at a lower dose. Doses may need to be reduced as the PTH levels decrease in response to the therapy. Thus, incremental dosing must be individualized and commensurate with PTH, serum calcium and phosphorus levels. The following is a suggested approach in dose titration: PTH LevelsCalcitriol Injection Dose the same or increasingincrease decreasing by <30%increase decreasing by >30%, <60%maintain decreasing by >60%decrease one and one-half to three times the upper limit of normalmaintain Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

Before initiating treatment, cardiovascular evaluation should be performed and echocardiography should be considered to assess for valvular disease. Dosage increases should not occur more rapidly than every 4 weeks, so that the physician can assess the patient’s response to each dosage level. If the patient does not respond adequately, and no additional benefit is observed with higher doses, the lowest dose that achieved maximal response should be used and other therapeutic approaches considered. Patients receiving long‑term treatment with cabergoline should undergo periodic assessment of their cardiac status and echocardiography should be considered. After a normal serum prolactin level has been maintained for 6 months, cabergoline may be discontinued, with periodic monitoring of the serum prolactin level to determine whether or when treatment with cabergoline should be reinstituted.

They should clearly understand the directions for using NICOTROL NS and safely disposing of the used container. They should be instructed to stop smoking completely when they begin using the product. Patients should be instructed not to sniff, swallow or inhale through the nose as the spray is being administered. They should also be advised to administer the spray with the head tilted back slightly. The dose of NICOTROL NS, should be individualized on the basis of each patient's nicotine dependence and the occurrence of symptoms of nicotine excess (See Individualization of Dosage). Each actuation of NICOTROL NS delivers a metered 50 microliter spray containing 0.5 mg of nicotine. One dose is 1 mg of nicotine (2 sprays, one in each nostril). Patients should be started with 1 or 2 doses per hour, which may be increased up to a maximum recommended dose of 40 mg (80 sprays, somewhat less than 1/2 bottle) per day. For best results, patients should be encouraged to use at least the recommended minimum of 8 doses per day, as less is unlikely to be effective. In clinical trials, the patients who successfully quit smoking used the product heavily when nicotine withdrawal was at its peak, sometimes up to the recommended maximum of 40 doses per day ( in heavier smokers).

If twice-a-day dosage is desired, the recommended dose is 500 mg every 12 hours. Dosage may be increased up to 4 g per day according to the severity of the infection. However, twice-a-day dosing is not recommended when doses larger than 1 g daily are administered. Children Age, weight, and severity of the infection are important factors in determining the proper dosage. The usual dosage is 30 to 50 mg/kg/day, in equally divided doses. For more severe infections, this dose may be doubled but should not exceed 4 g per day. In the treatment of streptococcal infections of the upper respiratory tract (e.g., tonsillitis or pharyngitis), the therapeutic dosage of erythromycin should be administered for at least ten days.

Isoflurane USP should only be delivered using a vaporizer specifically designed and designated for use with isoflurane. ( 2) • The administration of general anesthesia must be individualized and titrated based on the patient’s age and clinical status. ( 2) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Information Isoflurane should be administered only by persons trained in the administration of general anesthesia. Facilities for maintenance of a patent airway, artificial ventilation, oxygen enrichment, and circulatory resuscitation must be immediately available. Isoflurane is administered by inhalation. Isoflurane should be delivered from a vaporizer specifically designed for use with isoflurane. Dosage for induction and maintenance must be individualized and titrated to the desired effect according to the patient’s age and clinical status. With the exception of neonates, the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of isoflurane decreases with increasing patient age. Nitrous oxide decreases the MAC of isoflurane (see Table 1 ). Opioids decrease the MAC of isoflurane [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Isoflurane potentiates the muscle relaxant effect of all neuromuscular blockers and decreases the required doses of neuromuscular blocking agents [see Drug Interactions (7)] . The dose should be adjusted accordingly. All patients anesthetized with isoflurane should be continually monitored (e.g., monitoring of the electrocardiogram, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and end tidal CO 2). Isoflurane is a profound respiratory depressant. Excessive respiratory depression may be related to depth of anesthesia and respond to decreasing the inspired concentration of isoflurane. The depressant effect is accentuated by concurrent use of opioids and other respiratory depressants. Respiration should be closely monitored and assisted or controlled ventilation "

Such doses will normally produce an effective serum lithium level ranging between 1 and 1.5 mEq/L. Dosage must be individualized according to serum levels and clinical response. Regular monitoring of the patient’s clinical state and of serum lithium levels is necessary. Serum levels should be determined twice per week during the acute phase, and until the serum level and clinical condition of the patient have been stabilized.Long-term ControlThe desirable serum lithium levels are 0.6 to 1.2 mEq/L. Dosage will vary from one individual to another, but usually 300 mg of Lithium Carbonate t.i.d. or q.i.d., will maintain this level. Serum lithium levels in uncomplicated cases receiving maintenance therapy during remission should be monitored at least every two months.Patients abnormally sensitive to lithium may exhibit toxic signs at serum levels of 1 to 1.5 mEq/L. Elderly patients often respond to reduced dosage, and may exhibit signs of toxicity at serum levels ordinarily tolerated by other patients.N.B.Blood samples for serum lithium determination should be drawn immediately prior to the next dose when lithium concentrations are relatively stable (i.e., 8-12 hours after the previous dose). Total reliance must not be placed on serum levels alone. Accurate patient evaluation requires both clinical and laboratory analysis."

Because of potential physical incompatibilities, it is recommended that dobutamine not be mixed with other drugs in the same solution. Dobutamine should not be used in conjunction with other agents or diluents containing both sodium bisulfite and ethanol. Preparation and Stability At the time of administration, dobutamine must be further diluted in an IV container to at least a 50 mL solution using one of the following intravenous solutions as a diluent: 5% Dextrose Injection, 5% Dextrose and 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, 5% Dextrose and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, 10% Dextrose Injection, Isolyte® M with 5% Dextrose Injection, Lactated Ringer’s Injection, 5% Dextrose in Lactated Ringer’s Injection, Normosol®-M in D5-W, 20% Osmitrol® in Water for Injection, 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, or Sodium Lactate Injection. Intravenous solutions should be used within 24 hours. Recommended Dosage Infusion of dobutamine should be started at a low rate (0.5 to 1 mcg/kg/min) and titrated at intervals of a few minutes, guided by the patient’s response, including systemic blood pressure, urine flow, frequency of ectopic activity, heart rate and (whenever possible) measurements of cardiac output, central venous pressure, and/or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. In reported trials, the optimal infusion rates have varied from patient to patient, usually 2 to 20 mcg/kg/min but sometimes slightly outside of this range. On rare occasions, infusion rates up to 40 mcg/kg/min have been required to obtain the desired effect. Rates of infusion (mL/h) for dobutamine concentrations of 500 mcg/mL, 1000 mcg/mL, and 2000 mcg/mL necessary to attain various delivery rates of dobutamine (mcg/kg/min) for patients of different weights are given in Table 1.

It Should Be Emphasized That Dosage Requirements Are Variable And Must Be Individualized On The Basis Of The Disease Under Treatment And The Response Of The Patient. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage that maintains an adequate clinical response is reached. Situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient’s individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment. In this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of the corticosteroid for a period of time consistent with the patient’s condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 30 mg of dexamethasone for a week followed by 4 to 12 mg every other day for one month have been shown to be effective (see PRECAUTIONS, Neuropsychiatric). In pediatric patients, the initial dose of dexamethasone may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.02 to 0.3 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses (0.6 to 9 mg/m2bsa/day). For the purpose of comparison, the following is the equivalent milligram dosage of the various corticosteroids: Dexamethasone, 1.5 Methylprednisolone, 8 Prednisone, 10 Triamcinolone, 8 Prednisolone, 10 Betamethasone, 1.5 Hydrocortisone, 40 Paramethasone, 4 Cortisone, 50 These dose relationships apply only to oral or intravenous administration of these compound"

Take LAGEVRIO as soon as possible after a diagnosis of COVID-19 has been made, and within 5 days of symptom onset [see Emergency Use Authorization (1) and Clinical Studies (14)]. Completion of the full 5-day treatment course and continued isolation in accordance with public health recommendations are important to maximize viral clearance and minimize transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. LAGEVRIO is not authorized for use for longer than 5 consecutive days because the safety and efficacy have not been established. If the patient misses a dose of LAGEVRIO within 10 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient should take it as soon as possible and resume the normal dosing schedule. If the patient misses a dose by more than 10 hours, the patient should not take the missed dose and instead take the next dose at the regularly scheduled time. The patient should not double the dose to make up for a missed dose. Should a patient require hospitalization after starting treatment with LAGEVRIO, the patient may complete the full 5 day treatment course per the healthcare provider’s discretion. 2.2 Dosage Adjustments in Specific Populations No dosage adjustment is recommended based on renal or hepatic impairment or in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6, 8.7)]. 2.3 Administration via Nasogastric (NG), Orogastric (OG) and Gastrostomy (G) Tubes that are 12F or Larger or via Gastrojejunostomy (GJ) Tubes that are 14F or Larger Open four (4) capsules and transfer contents into a clean container with a lid.

For most patients, this can be accomplished by taking the first dose on awakening and the second dose 7 hours later. Dosage adjustments are not necessary for elderly patients or patients with altered renal or hepatic function. As noted above (CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY), multiple studies of organic nitrates have shown that maintenance of continuous 24-hour plasma levels results in refractory tolerance. The dosing regimen for Ismo tablets provides a daily nitrate-free interval to avoid the development of this tolerance.As also noted under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, well-controlled studies have shown that tolerance to Ismo tablets is avoided when using the twice-daily regimen in which the two doses are given 7 hours apart. This regimen has been shown to have antianginal efficacy beginning 1 hour after the first dose and lasting at least 5 hours after the second dose. The duration (if any) of antianginal activity beyond 12 hours has not been studied; large controlled studies with other nitrates suggest that no dosing regimen should be expected to provide more than about 12 hours of continuous antianginal efficacy per day.In clinical trials, Ismo tablets have been administered in a variety of regimens. Single doses less than 20 mg have not been adequately studied, while single doses greater than 20 mg have demonstrated no greater efficacy than doses of 20 mg."

Rasagiline tablets should not be used in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (2.3, 5.5) 2.1 General Dosing Recommendations When rasagiline tablets are prescribed as monotherapy or as adjunct therapy in patients not taking levodopa, patients may start rasagiline tablets at the recommended dose of 1 mg administered orally once daily. In patients taking levodopa, with or without other PD drugs (e.g., dopamine agonist, amantadine, anticholinergics), the recommended initial dose of rasagiline tablets is 0.5 mg once daily. If the patient tolerates the daily 0.5 mg dose, but a sufficient clinical response is not achieved, the dose may be increased to 1 mg once daily. When rasagiline tablets are used in combination with levodopa, a reduction of the levodopa dose may be considered, based upon individual response. The recommended doses of rasagiline tablets should not be exceeded because of risk of hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 2.2 Patients Taking Ciprofloxacin or Other CYP1A2 Inhibitors Patients taking concomitant ciprofloxacin or other CYP1A2 inhibitors should not exceed a dose of rasagiline tablets 0.5 mg once daily [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Drug Interactions (7.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.3 Patients with Hepatic Impairment Patients with mild hepatic impairment should not exceed a dose of rasagiline tablets 0.5 mg once daily.

The diluted solution should be protected from light, using an opaque sleeve, aluminum foil, or other opaque material. It is not necessary to cover the infusion drip chamber or the tubing. Verification of the chemical integrity of the product Sodium nitroprusside solution can be inactivated by reactions with trace contaminants. The products of these reactions are often blue, green, or red, much brighter than the faint brownish color of unreacted sodium nitroprusside. Discolored solutions, or solutions in which particulate matter is visible, should not be used. If properly protected from light, the freshly diluted solution is stable for 24 hours. No other drugs should be administered in the same solution with sodium nitroprusside. Avoidance of excessive hypotension While the average effective rate in adult and pediatric patients is about 3 mcg/kg/min, some patients will become dangerously hypotensive when they receive sodium nitroprusside at this rate. Infusion of sodium nitroprusside should therefore be started at a very low rate (0.3 mcg/kg/min), with upward titration every few minutes until the desired effect is achieved or the maximum recommended infusion rate (10 mcg/kg/min) has been reached. Because sodium nitroprusside’s hypotensive effect is very rapid in onset and in dissipation, small variations in infusion rate can lead to wide, undesirable variations in blood pressure. Since there is inherent variation in blood pressure measurement, confirm the drug effect at any infusion rate after an additional 5 minutes before titrating to a higher dose to achieve the desired blood pressure. Sodium nitroprusside should not be infused through ordinary I.V. apparatus, regulated only by gravity and mechanical clamps. Only an infusion pump,p"

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Hydroxocobalamin injection should be given only intramuscularly. In patients with Addisonian Pernicious Anemia, parenteral therapy with vitamin B12 is the recommended method of treatment and will be required for the remainder of the patient’s life. Oral therapy is not dependable. In other patients with vitamin B12 deficiency, the duration of therapy and route of administration will depend upon the cause and whether or not it is reversible. Confirmatory diagnostic studies should be performed prior to initiating therapy, if possible, and the patient should be followed with appropriate studies to demonstrate hematologic improvement (Hgb, hematocrit, RBC, reticulocyte count). A diagnostic trial utilizing physiologic doses of vitamin B12 (1 mcg daily) and observing daily reticulocyte counts after establishing a baseline may also be performed. The observation of reticulocytosis which usually occurs between the third and tenth day of therapy confirms the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency. In seriously ill patients it may be advisable to administer both vitamin B12 and folic acid while awaiting the results of distinguishing laboratory studies. It is not necessary to withhold vitamin B12 therapy until the precise cause of B12 deficiency is established since absorption studies can be performed at any time. Serum potassium should be closely observed the first 48 hours and potassium should be administered if necessary. Treatment of Vitamin B12 Deficiency Thirty mcg daily for 5 to 10 days followed by 100 to 200 mcg monthly injected intramuscularly. If the patient is critically ill, or has neurologic disease, an infectious disease or hyperthyroidism, considerably higher doses may be indicated. However, current data indicate that the optimum obtainable neurologic response may "

    "package_label": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Lisinopril is an effective treatment of hypertension in once-daily doses of 10-80 mg, while hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5-50 mg. In clinical trials of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy using lisinopril doses of 10-80 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25-50 mg, the antihypertensive response rates generally increased with increasing dose of either component.The side effects (see WARNINGS) of lisinopril are generally rare and apparently independent of dose; those of hydrochlorothiazide are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily hypokalemia) and dose-independent phenomena (e.g., pancreatitis), the former much more common than the latter. Therapy with any combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide will be associated with both sets of dose-independent side effects, but addition of lisinopril in clinical trials blunted the hypokalemia normally seen with diuretics.To minimize dose-independent side effects, it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy.Dose Titration Guided By Clinical Effect: A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with either lisinopril or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy may be switched to lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide 10 mg/12.5 mg or lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide 20 mg/12.5 mg. Further increases of either or both components could depend on clinical response. The hydrochlorothiazide dose should generally not be increased until 2-3 weeks have elapsed. Patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with 25 mg of daily hydrochlorothiazide, but who experience significant potassium loss with this regimen, may achieve similar or greater blood pressure control with less potassium loss if they are switched to lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide 10 mg/12.5 mg. Dosage higher than lisinopril 80 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg should not be used.Replaceme"

In selecting a dose of digoxin, the following factors must be considered: The body weight of the patient. Doses should be calculated based upon lean (i.e., ideal) body weight. The patient's renal function, preferably evaluated on the basis of estimated creatinine clearance. The patient's age. Infants and children require different doses of digoxin than adults. Also, advanced age may be indicative of diminished renal function even in patients with normal serum creatinine concentration (i.e., below 1.5 mg/dL). Concomitant disease states, concurrent medications, or other factors likely to alter the pharmacokinetic or pharma-codynamic profile of digoxin (see PRECAUTIONS ). Serum Digoxin Concentrations: In general, the dose of digoxin used should be determined on clinical grounds. However, measurement of serum digoxin concentrations can be helpful to the clinician in determining the adequacy of digoxin therapy and in assigning certain probabilities to the likelihood of digoxin intoxication. About two-thirds of adults considered adequately digitalized (without evidence of toxicity) have serum digoxin concentrations ranging from 0.8 to 2 ng/mL. However, digoxin may produce clinical benefits even at serum concentrations below this range. About two-thirds of adult patients with clinical toxicity have serum digoxin concentrations greater than 2 ng/mL. However, since one-third of patients with clinical toxicity have concentrations less than 2 ng/mL, values below 2 ng/mL do not rule out the possibility that a certain sign or symptom is related to digoxin therapy. Rarely, there are patients who are unable to tolerate digoxin at serum concentrations below 0.8 ng/mL. Consequently, the serum concentration of digoxin should always be interpret"

The recommended dosage range for Amnesteem is 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day given in two divided doses with food for 15 to 20 weeks. In studies comparing 0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg/day,8 it was found that all dosages provided initial clearing of disease, but there was a greater need for retreatment with the lower dosages. During treatment, the dose may be adjusted according to response of the disease and/or the appearance of clinical side effects — some of which may be dose related. Adult patients whose disease is very severe with scarring or is primarily manifested on the trunk may require dose adjustments up to 2 mg/kg/day, as tolerated. Failure to take Amnesteem with food will significantly decrease absorption. Before upward dose adjustments are made, the patients should be questioned about their compliance with food instructions. The safety of once daily dosing with Amnesteem has not been established. Once daily dosing is not recommended. If the total nodule count has been reduced by more than 70% prior to completing 15 to 20 weeks of treatment, the drug may be discontinued. After a period of 2 months or more off therapy, and if warranted by persistent or recurring severe nodular acne, a second course of therapy may be initiated. The optimal interval before retreatment has not been defined for patients who have not completed skeletal growth. Long-term use of Amnesteem, even in low doses, has not been studied, and is not recommended. It is important that Amnesteem be given at the recommended doses for no longer than the recommended duration. The effect of long-term use of Amnesteem on bone loss is unknown (see WARNINGS: Skeletal: Bone Mineral Density, Hyperostosis, and Premature Epiphyseal Closure). Contraceptive measures must be followed for any subsequent course of therapy (see PRECAUTIONS). Table 4. Amnesteem Dosing by Body Weight (Based on Administration with Fo"

    "package_label": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION All patients should be evaluated for bleeding disorders before administration of INNOHEP®. Since coagulation parameters are unsuitable for monitoring INNOHEP® activity, routine monitoring of coagulation parameters is not required (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests). Adult Dosage The recommended dose of INNOHEP® for the treatment of DVT with or without PE is 175 anti-Xa IU/kg of body weight, administered SC once daily for at least 6 days and until the patient is adequately anticoagulated with warfarin (INR at least 2.0 for two consecutive days). Warfarin sodium therapy should be initiated when appropriate (usually within 1-3 days of INNOHEP® initiation). Pregnancy has little or no influence on the pharmacokinetics of INNOHEP® and no dosing adjustment is needed for pregnancy. As INNOHEP® may theoretically affect the PT/INR, patients receiving both INNOHEP® and warfarin should have blood for PT/INR determination drawn just prior to the next scheduled dose of INNOHEP®.Table 8 provides INNOHEP® doses for the treatment of DVT with or without PE. It is necessary to calculate the appropriate INNOHEP® dose for patient weights not displayed in Table 8.An appropriately calibrated syringe should be used to assure withdrawal of the correct volume of drug from INNOHEP® vials.Table 8 INNOHEP® Weight-based Dosing for Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis With or Without Symptomatic Pulmonary Embolism DVT Treatment Patient BodyWeight inPounds175 IU/kg SC Once Daily20,000 IU per mLPatient BodyWeight inKilograms Dose(IU)Amount(mL) 68-806,0000.331-36 81-947,0000.3537-42 95-1078,0000.443-48 108-1189,0000.4549-53 119-13110,0000.554-59 132-14411,0000.5560-65 145-15512,0000.666-70 156-16813,0000.6571-76 169-18214,0000.777-82 183-19515,0000.7583-88 196-20616,0000.889-93 207-21917,0000.8594-99 220-23218,0000.9100-105 233-24319,0000.95106-110 244-25620,0001111-116 257-27021,0001.05117-122 271-28322,0001.1123-128 284-29423,0001.15129-133 295-30724,0001.2134-139 308-32025,"

    "package_label": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Individual tablets should not be fractionated and only one tablet should be administered at each dosing interval. Generally speaking, carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets should be used as a substitute for patients already stabilized on equivalent doses of carbidopa-levodopa and entacapone. However, some patients who have been stabilized on a given dose of carbidopa-levodopa may be treated with a combination of carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone if a decision has been made to add entacapone (see below). The optimum daily dosage of carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets must be determined by careful titration in each patient. Carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets are available in six strengths, each in a 1:4 ratio of carbidopa to levodopa and combined with 200 mg of entacapone in a standard release formulation (carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablet, containing 12.5 mg of carbidopa, 50 mg of levodopa and 200 mg of entacapone; 18.75 mg of carbidopa, 75 mg of levodopa and 200 mg of entacapone; 25 mg of carbidopa, 100 mg of levodopa and 200 mg of entacapone; 31.25 mg of carbidopa, 125 mg of levodopa and 200 mg of entacapone; 37.5 mg of carbidopa, 150 mg of levodopa and 200 mg of entacapone; and 50 mg of carbidopa, 200 mg of levodopa and 200 mg of entacapone). Therapy should be individualized and adjusted according to the desired therapeutic response. Studies show that peripheral dopa decarboxylase is saturated by carbidopa at approximately 70 mg to 100 mg a day. Patients receiving less than this amount of carbidopa are more likely to experience nausea and vomiting. Clinical experience with daily doses above 1,600 mg of entacapone is limited. It is recommended that no more than one carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablet be taken at each dosing administration. Thus the maximum recommended daily dose of carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets, containing 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, 125 mg and 150 mg of levodopa, defined by the ma"

(2) Hypertension: Most patients start at 5 mg once daily. Dose can be increased at 2-week intervals up to 40 mg. (2.1) 2.1 Hypertension The dose of BYSTOLIC must be individualized to the needs of the patient. For most patients, the recommended starting dose is 5 mg once daily, with or without food, as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure, the dose can be increased at 2-week intervals up to 40 mg. A more frequent dosing regimen is unlikely to be beneficial. Renal Impairment In patients with severe renal impairment (ClCr less than 30 mL/min) the recommended initial dose is 2.5 mg once daily; titrate up slowly if needed. BYSTOLIC has not been studied in patients receiving dialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)]. Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, the recommended initial dose is 2.5 mg once daily; titrate up slowly if needed. BYSTOLIC has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and therefore it is not recommended in that population [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)]. 2.2 Subpopulations Geriatric Patients It is not necessary to adjust the dose in the elderly [see use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. CYP2D6 Polymorphism No dose adjustments are necessary for patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. The clinical effect and safety profile observed in poor metabolizers were similar to those of extensive metabolizers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

The recommended dosing range is 10-80 mg/day in single or two divided doses; the maximum recommended dose is 80 mg/day. Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy (see NCEP Guidelines and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Patients requiring reductions in LDL-C of 20% or more to achieve their goal (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ) should be started on 20 mg/day of lovastatin tablets. A starting dose of 10 mg may be considered for patients requiring smaller reductions. Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more. Cholesterol levels should be monitored periodically and consideration should be given to reducing the dosage of lovastatin tablets if cholesterol levels fall significantly below the targeted range. Dosage in Patients taking Cyclosporine or Danazol In patients taking cyclosporine or danazol concomitantly with lovastatin (see WARNINGS, Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis ), therapy should begin with 10 mg of lovastatin tablets and should not exceed 20 mg/day. Dosage in Patients taking Amiodarone or Verapamil In patients taking amiodarone or verapamil concomitantly with lovastatin tablets, the dose should not exceed 40 mg/day (see WARNINGS, Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions, Other drug interactions ).

Dosage is to be directed by a physician and is dependent upon age, weight, clinical condition of the patient and laboratory determinations. Frequent laboratory determinations and clinical evaluation are essential to monitor changes in blood glucose and electrolyte concentrations, and fluid and electrolyte balance during prolonged parenteral therapy. When a hypertonic solution is to be administered peripherally, it should be slowly infused through a small bore needle, placed well within the lumen of a large vein to minimize venous irritation. Carefully avoid infiltration. In the average adult, daily requirements of sodium and chloride are met by the infusion of one liter of 0.9% sodium chloride (154 mEq each of sodium and chloride). Usually up to 40 mEq of potassium per liter daily is sufficient to replace normal loss in adults. Infusion rates should not exceed 10 mEq per hour or 120 mEq per day. A liter of fluid containing 40 mEq of potassium should be administered over an 8-hour period. Fluid administration should be based on calculated maintenance or replacement fluid requirements for each patient. Pediatric Dosage and Administration There is no specific pediatric dose. The dose is dependent on weight, clinical condition and laboratory results. See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS . Some additives may be incompatible. Consult with pharmacist. When introducing additives, use aseptic techniques. Mix thoroughly. Do not store. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit."

    "package_label": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION General Dosing Considerations It is particularly important to administer bupropion hydrochloride tablets in a manner most likely to minimize the risk of seizure (see WARNINGS ). Increases in dose should not exceed 100 mg/day in a 3-day period. Gradual escalation in dosage is also important if agitation, motor restlessness, and insomnia, often seen during the initial days of treatment, are to be minimized. If necessary, these effects may be managed by temporary reduction of dose or the short-term administration of an intermediate to long-acting sedative hypnotic. A sedative hypnotic usually is not required beyond the first week of treatment. Insomnia may also be minimized by avoiding bedtime doses. If distressing, untoward effects supervene, dose escalation should be stopped. No single dose of bupropion hydrochloride tablets should exceed 150 mg. Bupropion hydrochloride tablets should be administered 3 times daily, preferably with at least 6 hours between successive doses. Usual Dosage for Adults The usual adult dose is 300 mg/day, given 3 times daily. Dosing should begin at 200 mg/day, given as 100 mg twice daily. Based on clinical response, this dose may be increased to 300 mg/day, given as 100 mg 3 times daily, no sooner than 3 days after beginning therapy (see Table 3). Table 3. Dosing Regimen Treatment Day Total Daily Dose Tablet Strength Number of Tablets Morning Midday Evening 1 200 mg 100 mg 1 0 1 4 300 mg 100 mg 1 1 1 Increasing the Dosage Above 300 mg/Day As with other antidepressants, the full antidepressant effect of bupropion hydrochloride tablets may not be evident until 4 weeks of treatment or longer. An increase in dosage, up to a maximum of 450 mg/day, given in divided doses of not more than 150 mg each, may be considered for patients in whom no clinical improvement is noted after several weeks of treatment at 300 mg/day. Dosing above 300 mg/day may be accomplished using the 75 or 100 mg tablets. The 100 mg tablet must be ad"

Daily dosage (in terms of base equivalents) should be adjusted to the individual patient's needs as assessed by the severity of symptoms and previous history of response to antipsychotic drugs. Oral Administration Initial dosage of 10 mg twice daily is recommended, although in severely disturbed patients initial dosage up to a total of 50 mg daily may be desirable. Dosage should then be increased fairly rapidly over the first seven to ten days until there is effective control of symptoms of schizophrenia. The usual therapeutic and maintenance range is 60 mg to 100 mg daily. However, as with other drugs used to treat schizophrenia, some patients respond to lower dosage and others require higher dosage for optimal benefit. Daily dosage higher than 250 mg is not recommended. Maintenance Therapy For maintenance therapy, dosage should be reduced to the lowest level compatible with symptom control; many patients have been maintained satisfactorily at dosages in the range of 20 to 60 mg daily."

This may be accomplished by using a vaporizer calibrated specifically for sevoflurane. The administration of general anesthesia must be individualized based on the patient's response. Replacement of Desiccated CO 2 Absorbents When a clinician suspects that the CO2 absorbent may be desiccated, it should be replaced. The exothermic reaction that occurs with sevoflurane and CO2 absorbents is increased when the CO2 absorbent becomes desiccated, such as after an extended period of dry gas flow through the CO2 absorbent canisters (see PRECAUTIONS ). Pre-anesthetic Medication No specific premedication is either indicated or contraindicated with sevoflurane. The decision as to whether or not to premedicate and the choice of premedication is left to the discretion of the anesthesiologist. Induction Sevoflurane has a nonpungent odor and does not cause respiratory irritability; it is suitable for mask induction in pediatrics and adults. Maintenance Surgical levels of anesthesia can usually be achieved with concentrations of 0.5 - 3% sevoflurane with or without the concomitant use of nitrous oxide. Sevoflurane can be administered with any type of anesthesia circuit. Table 9.

Dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection can be given directly from the vial, or it can be added to Sodium Chloride Injection or Dextrose Injection and administered by intravenous drip. Solutions used for intravenous administration or further dilution of this product should be preservative free when used in the neonate, especially the premature infant. When it is mixed with an infusion solution, sterile precautions should be observed. Since infusion solutions generally do not contain preservatives, mixtures should be used within 24 hours. DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT. Intravenous and Intramuscular Injection: The initial dosage of dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection varies from 0.5 to 9 mg a day depending on the disease being treated. In less severe diseases doses lower than 0.5 mg may suffice, while in severe diseases doses higher than 9 mg may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until the patient’s response is satisfactory. If a satisfactory clinical response does not occur after a reasonable period of time, discontinue dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection and transfer the patient to other therapy. After a favorable initial response, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial dosage in small amounts to the lowest dosage that maintains an adequate clinical response. Patients should be observed closely for signs that might require dosage adjustment, including changes in clinical status resulting from remissions or exacerbations of the disease, individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of stress (e.g., surgery, infection, trauma). During stress it may be necessary to increase dosage temporarily. If the drug is to be stopped after mor"

The dose should be tailored to the needs of the patient and may be increased or decreased depending on the severity of the symptoms. Dosage adjustments may be made after initiation of drug therapy or during exacerbations of the disease. Total daily dosage should not exceed 3,200 mg. 2.1 General Dosing Instructions Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of fenoprofen and other treatment options before deciding to use fenoprofen. Use lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5) ]. Fenoprofen may be administered with meals or with milk. Although the total amount absorbed is not affected, peak blood levels are delayed and diminished. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis generally seem to require larger doses of fenoprofen than do those with osteoarthritis. The smallest dose that yields acceptable control should be employed. Although improvement may be seen in a few days in many patients, an additional 2 to 3 weeks may be required to gauge the full benefits of therapy. 2.2 Analgesia For the treatment of mild to moderate pain, the recommended dosage is 200 mg given orally every 4 to 6 hours, as needed. 2.3 Rheumatoid Arthritis and Osteoarthritis For the relief of signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis the recommended dose is 400 to 600 mg given orally, 3 or 4 times a day.

(2) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended dosage is 25 mcg/kg administered intravenously within 5 minutes and then 0.15 mcg/kg/min for up to 18 hours. 2.2 Administration For intravenous use only. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. To open the 250 mL premixed bag, first tear off its foil overpouch. The plastic may be somewhat opaque because of moisture absorption during sterilization; the opacity will diminish gradually. Check for leaks by squeezing the inner bag firmly; if any leaks are found or sterility is suspect then the solution should be discarded. Do not use unless the solution is clear and the seal is intact. Administration Instructions The bolus dose of tirofiban hydrochloride injection may be administered from the 250 mL premixed bag. Do not dilute. Administer the bolus dose within 5 minutes via IV pump. Immediately following the bolus dose administration, administer the maintenance infusion from the 250 mL premixed bag via an IV pump. Discard any unused portion left in the bag. The recommended bolus volume using 250 mL premixed bag can be calculated using the following equation: Bolus Volume (mL) = 25 mcg/kg X body weight (kg) 50 mcg/mL The recommended infusion rate for patients with CrCl (Creatinine Clearance) > 60 mL/min using the 250 mL premixed bag can be calculated using the following equation: Infusion Rate for CrCl > 60 mL/min (mL/h) = 0.15 mcg/kg/min x body weight (kg) x 60 min/h 50 mcg/mL Example calculation of infusion rate for 60 kg patient with CrCl > 60 mL/min using the 250 mL premixed bag: Infusion Rate for CrCl > 60 mL/min (mL/h) = 0.15 mcg/kg/min x 60 kg x 60 min/h =10.8 mL/h 50 mcg/mL "

For the indications in risk of invasive breast cancer the optimum duration of treatment is not known [see Clinical Studies (14.3, 14.4)] . 2.2 Recommendations for Calcium and Vitamin D Supplementation For either osteoporosis treatment or prevention, supplemental calcium and/or vitamin D should be added to the diet if daily intake is inadequate. Postmenopausal women require an average of 1500 mg/day of elemental calcium. Total daily intake of calcium above 1500 mg has not demonstrated additional bone benefits while daily intake above 2000 mg has been associated with increased risk of adverse effects, including hypercalcemia and kidney stones. The recommended intake of vitamin D is 400-800 IU daily. Patients at increased risk for vitamin D insufficiency (e.g., over the age of 70 years, nursing home bound, or chronically ill) may need additional vitamin D supplements. Patients with gastrointestinal malabsorption syndromes may require higher doses of vitamin D supplementation and measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be considered."

Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C) should be treated with caution and monitored for treatment response [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 2.3 Dosage in Pediatric Patients The safety and efficacy of the proposed pediatric dosing regimens have not been evaluated due to the observed increase in mortality associated with tigecycline in adult patients. Avoid use of tigecycline in pediatric patients unless no alternative antibacterial drugs are available. Under these circumstances, the following doses are suggested:"

St. John’s Wort may decrease dasatinib plasma concentrations unpredictably and should be avoided. If patients must be coadministered a strong CYP3A4 inducer, based on pharmacokinetic studies, a SPRYCEL dose increase should be considered. If the dose of SPRYCEL is increased, the patient should be monitored carefully for toxicity [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Concomitant Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors: CYP3A4 inhibitors (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, and voriconazole) may increase dasatinib plasma concentrations. Grapefruit juice may also increase plasma concentrations of dasatinib and should be avoided.

    "package_label": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Fosinopril is an effective treatment of hypertension in once-daily doses of 10–80 mg, while hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5–50 mg per day. In clinical trials of fosinopril/hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy using fosinopril doses of 2.5–40 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses at 5–37.5 mg, the anti-hypertensive effects increased with increasing dose of either component.The hazards (see WARNINGS) of fosinopril are generally rare and apparently independent of dose; those of hydrochlorothiazide are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily hypokalemia) and dose-independent phenomena (e.g., pancreatitis), the former much more common than the latter. Therapy with any combination of fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide will be associated with both sets of dose-independent hazards. To minimize dose-independent hazards, it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy. Dose Titration by Clinical Effect: A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with fosinopril or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy may be switched to combination therapy with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Dosage must be guided by clinical response; controlled clinical trials showed that the addition of 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide to 10–20 mg of fosinopril will typically be associated with additional reduction in seated diastolic blood pressure at 24 hours after dosing. On average, the effect of the combination of 10 mg of fosinopril with 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide was similar to the effect seen with monotherapy using either 40 mg of fosinopril or 37.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. Use in Renal Impairment: In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance is < 30 mL/min/1.73m2, serum creatine roughly ≥3 mg/dL or 265 μmol/L), loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides, so fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide are not recomm"

In the controlled clinical trials establishing the efficacy of mirtazapine in the treatment of major depressive disorder, the effective dose range was generally 15 to 45 mg/day. While the relationship between dose and satisfactory response in the treatment of major depressive disorder for mirtazapine has not been adequately explored, patients not responding to the initial 15 mg dose may benefit from dose increases up to a maximum of 45 mg/day. Mirtazapine has an elimination half-life of approximately 20 to 40 hours; therefore, dose changes should not be made at intervals of less than 1 to 2 weeks in order to allow sufficient time for evaluation of the therapeutic response to a given dose. Elderly and Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment The clearance of mirtazapine is reduced in elderly patients and in patients with moderate to severe renal or hepatic impairment. Consequently, the prescriber should be aware that plasma mirtazapine levels may be increased in these patient groups, compared to levels observed in younger adults without renal or hepatic impairment (see PRECAUTIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Maintenance/Extended Treatment It is generally agreed that acute episodes of depression require several months or longer of sustained pharmacological therapy beyond response to the acute episode. Systematic evaluation of mirtazapine tablets has demonstrated that its efficacy in major depressive disorder is maintained for periods of up to 40 weeks following 8 to 12 weeks of initial treatment at a dose of 15 to 45 mg/day (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Based on these limited data, it is unknown whether or not the dose of mirtazapine needed for maintenance treatment is identical to the dose needed to achieve an initial response.

The intracavernous injection should be given over a 5 to 10 second interval. In a study with a dose range of 1 to 20 mcg of edex®, the mean dose was 10.7 mcg at the end of the dose titration period. In two studies with a dose range of 1 to 40 mcg of edex®, the mean dose was 21.9 mcg at the end of the dose titration period. Doses greater than 40 mcg have not been studied. A &frac12;-inch, 27- to 30-gauge needle is generally recommended for the intracavernous injection. The patient is advised not to exceed the optimum edex® dose which was determined in the doctor's office. The lowest possible effective dose should always be used. Initial Titration in Physician's Office Erectile Dysfunction of Vasculogenic, Psychogenic, or Mixed Etiology: Dosage titration should be initiated at 2.5 mcg of alprostadil. If there is a partial response, the dose may be increased by 2.5 mcg to a dose of 5 mcg and then in increments of 5 to 10 mcg, depending upon erectile response, until the dose that produces an erection suitable for intercourse and not exceeding a duration of 1 hour is reached. If there is no response to the initial 2.5-mcg dose, the second dose may be increased to 7.5 mcg, followed by increments of 5 to 10 mcg. The patient must stay in the physician's office until complete detumescence occurs. If there is no response, then the next higher dose may be given within 1 hour. If there is a response, then there should be at least a 1-day interval before the next dose is given. Erectile Dysfunction of Pure Neurogenic Etiology (Spinal Cord Injury): Dosage titration should be initiated at 1.25 mcg of alprostadil. The dose may be increased by 1.25 mcg to a dose of 2.5 mcg, followed by an increment of 2.5 mcg to a dose of 5 mcg, and then in 5-mcg increments until the dose that produces an erection suitable for intercourse and no"

Eprosartan can be administered once or twice daily and total daily doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg. There is limited experience with doses beyond 800 mg/day. If the antihypertensive effect measured at trough using once-daily monotherapy dosing is inadequate, a twice-a-day regimen at the same total daily dose or an increase in dose may give a more satisfactory response. Achievement of maximum blood pressure reduction in most patients may take 2 to 3 weeks. Hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 mg to 50 mg once daily. To minimize dose-independent side effects, it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy. The side effects (see WARNINGS ) of eprosartan are generally rare and apparently independent of dose; those of hydrochlorothiazide are a mixture of dose-dependent (primarily hypokalemia) and dose-independent (e.g., pancreatitis) phenomena, the former much more common than the latter. Therapy with any combination of eprosartan and hydrochlorothiazide will be associated with both sets of dose-independent side effects. Replacement Therapy TEVETEN® HCT may be substituted for the individual components. The usual recommended dose of TEVETEN® HCT is 600 mg/12.5 mg once daily when used as combination therapy in patients who are not volume-depleted (see WARNINGS, Hypotension in Volume-and/or Salt-Depleted Patients ). If the antihypertensive effect measured at trough using TEVETEN® HCT 600/12.5 mg is inadequate, patients may be titrated to TEVETEN® HCT 600/25 mg once daily. Higher doses have not been studied in combination. Achievement of maximum blood pressure reduction in most patients may take 2 to 3 weeks. If the patient under treatment with"

The usual irrigation dose is one 1-mL ampul a day for up to 10 days. Using strict aseptic techniques, the contents of 1-mL ampul of Neomycin and Polymyxin B Sulfates Solution for Irrigation should be added to a 1,000-mL container of isotonic saline solution. This container should then be connected to the inflow lumen of the “three-way” catheter which has been inserted with full aseptic precautions; use of a sterile lubricant is recommended during insertion of the catheter. The outflow lumen should be connected, via a sterile disposable plastic tube, to a disposable plastic collection bag. Stringent procedures, such as taping the inflow and outflow junction at the catheter, should be observed when necessary to insure the junctional integrity of the system. For most patients, the inflow rate of the 1,000-mL saline solution of neomycin and polymyxin B should be adjusted to a slow drip to deliver about 1,000 mL every 24 hours. If the patient’s urine output exceeds 2 liters per day, it is recommended that the inflow rate be adjusted to deliver 2,000 mL of the solution in a 24-hour period. It is important that the rinse of the bladder be continuous; the inflow or rinse solution should not be interrupted for more than a few minutes. Preparation of the irrigation solution should be performed with strict aseptic techniques. The prepared solution should be stored at 4°C, and should be used within 48 hours following preparation to reduce the risk of contamination with resistant microorganisms."

Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).After observing the response to initial therapy with naproxen, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient’s needs. Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis, and Ankylosing Spondylitis The recommended dose is 250 mg, 375 mg, or 500 mg twice daily. During long-term administration, the dose may be adjusted up or down depending on the clinical response of the patient. A lower daily dose may suffice for long-term administration. The morning and evening doses do not have to be equal in size and the administration of the drug more frequently than twice daily is not necessary.In patients who tolerate lower doses well, the dose may be increased to naproxen 1500 mg per day for limited periods of up to 6 months when a higher level of anti-inflammatory/analgesic activity is required. When treating such patients with naproxen 1500 mg/day, the physician should observe sufficient increased clinical benefits to offset the potential increased risk (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, and INDIVIDUALIZATION OF DOSAGE). Geriatric Patients Studies indicate that although total plasma concentration of naproxen is unchanged, the unbound plasma fraction of naproxen is increased in the elderly. Caution is advised when high doses are required and some adjustment of dosage may be required in elderly patients. As with other drugs used in the elderly, it is prudent to use the lowest effective dose. Juvenile Arthritis The recommended total daily dose of naproxen is approximately 10 mg/kg given in 2 divided doses (i.e., 5 mg/kg given twice a day). Naproxen tablets are not well suited to this dosage so use of naproxen oral suspension is recommended for this indication. Management of Pain, Primary Dysmenorrhea and A"

(2.2, 2.3) •Use telmisartan and amlodipine tablets to provide additional blood pressure lowering for patients not adequately controlled with amlodipine (or another dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker) alone or with telmisartan (or another angiotensin receptor blocker) alone. (2.3) •Dosage may be increased after at least 2 weeks to a maximum dose of 80/ 10 mg once daily, usually by increasing one component at a time but both components can be raised to achieve more rapid control. (2.1, 2.2) •Majority of antihypertensive effect is attained within 2 weeks. (2.1) •Initiate with 40/5 mg or 80/5 mg once daily. (2.4) •Switch patients who experience dose-limiting adverse reactions on amlodipine to telmisartan and amlodipine tablets containing a lower dose of that component. (2.3) 2.1 General Considerations Telmisartan is an effective treatment of hypertension in once daily doses of 20 to 80 mg while amlodipine is effective in doses of 2.5 to 10 mg. Dosage must be individualized and may be increased after at least 2 weeks. Most of the antihypertensive effect is apparent within 2 weeks and maximal reduction is generally attained after 4 weeks. The maximum recommended dose of telmisartan and amlodipine tablets is 80/10 mg once daily. The adverse reactions of telmisartan are uncommon and independent of dose; those of amlodipine are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily peripheral edema) and dose-independent phenomena, the former much more common than the latter [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Telmisartan and amlodipine tablets may be taken with or without food. 2.2 Replacement Therapy Patients receiving amlodipine and telmisartan from separate tablets may instead receive telmisartan a"

OXISTAT® Cream should be applied once daily in the treatment of tinea (pityriasis) versicolor. Tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea (pityriasis) versicolor should be treated for 2 weeks and tinea pedis for 1 month to reduce the possibility of recurrence. If a patient shows no clinical improvement after the treatment period, the diagnosis should be reviewed. Note: Tinea (pityriasis) versicolor may give rise to hyperpigmented or hypopigmented patches on the trunk that may extend to the neck, arms, and upper thighs. Treatment of the infection may not immediately result in restoration of pigment to the affected sites. Normalization of pigment following successful therapy is variable and may take months, depending on individual skin type and incidental sun exposure. Although tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is not contagious, it may recur because the organism that causes the disease is part of the normal skin flora."

The recommended maintenance dose for all cholestyramine for oral suspension powdered products is 2 to 4 packets or scoopfuls daily (8 to 16 grams anhydrous cholestyramine resin) divided into two doses. Four grams of anhydrous cholestyramine resin is contained in each measured dose of Cholestyramine as follows: Cholestyramine for Oral Suspension USP 9 grams Cholestyramine for Oral Suspension USP, Light 5 grams It is recommended that increases in dose be gradual with periodic assessment of lipid/lipoprotein levels at intervals of not less than 4 weeks. The maximum recommended daily dose is six packets or scoopfuls of cholestyramine for oral suspension (24 grams of anhydrous cholestyramine resin). The suggested time of administration is at mealtime but may be modified to avoid interference with absorption of other medications. Although the recommended dosing schedule is twice daily, cholestyramine for oral suspension may be administered in 1 to 6 doses per day. Cholestyramine should not be taken in its dry form. Always mix Cholestyramine with water or other fluids before ingesting. See Preparation Instructions. Concomitant Therapy Preliminary evidence suggests that the lipid-lowering effects of Cholestyramine on total and LDL-cholesterol are enhanced when combined with a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, e.g., pravastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin, and fluvastatin. Additive effects on LDL-cholesterol are also seen with combined nicotinic acid/Cholestyramine therapy. See the Drug Interactions subsection of the PRECAUTIONS section for recommendations on administering concomitant therapy.

If one dose is missed, treatment should continue with the next dose as normal. The dosage of latanoprost ophthalmic solution should not exceed once daily; the combined use of two or more prostaglandins, or prostaglandin analogs including latanoprost ophthalmic solution is not recommended. It has been shown that administration of these prostaglandin drug products more than once daily may decrease the intraocular pressure lowering effect or cause paradoxical elevations in IOP. Reduction of the intraocular pressure starts approximately 3 to 4 hours after administration and the maximum effect is reached after 8 to 12 hours. latanoprost ophthalmic solution may be used concomitantly with other topical ophthalmic drug products to lower intraocular pressure. If more than one topical ophthalmic drug is being used, the drugs should be administered at least five (5) minutes apart."

Adults and Children 12 years of age and older The recommended dose of ACCOLATE in adults and children 12 years and older is 20 mg twice daily. Pediatric Patients 5 through 11 years of age The recommended dose of ACCOLATE in children 5 through 11 years of age is 10 mg twice daily. Elderly Patients: Based on cross-study comparisons, the clearance of zafirlukast is reduced in elderly patients (65 years of age and older), such that Cmax and AUC are approximately twice those of younger adults. In clinical trials, a dose of 20 mg twice daily was not associated with an increase in the overall incidence of adverse events or withdrawals because of adverse events in elderly patients. Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The clearance of zafirlukast is reduced in patients with stable alcoholic cirrhosis such that the Cmax and AUC are approximately 50 - 60% greater than those of normal adults. ACCOLATE has not been evaluated in patients with hepatitis or in long-term studies of patients with cirrhosis. Patients with Renal Impairment: Dosage adjustment is not required for patients with renal impairment."

Adults The initial dose is 300 mg daily. In patients with severe hyperthyroidism, very large goiters, or both, the initial dose may be increased to 400 mg daily; an occasional patient will require 600 to 900 mg daily initially. The usual maintenance dose is 100 to 150 mg daily. Pediatric Patients Propylthiouracil is generally not recommended for use in the pediatric patient population except in rare instances in which other alternative therapies are not appropriate options. Studies evaluating appropriate dosing regimen have not been conducted in the pediatric population although general practice would suggest initiation of therapy in patients 6 years or older at a dosage of 50 mg daily with careful upward titration based on clinical response and evaluation of TSH and free T4 levels. Although cases of severe liver injury have been reported with doses as low as 50 mg/day, most cases were associated with doses of 300 mg/day and higher. Geriatric Patients Clinical studies of propylthiouracil did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 or over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

A single daily dose is recommended. Therapy with metolazone tablets, USP, should be titrated to gain an initial therapeutic response and to determine the minimal dose possible to maintain the desired therapeutic response. Usual Single Daily Dosage Schedules Suitable initial dosages will usually fall in the ranges given. Edema of cardiac failure: Metolazone tablets, USP, 5 to 20 mg once daily. Edema of renal disease: Metolazone tablets, USP, 5 to 20 mg once daily. Mild to moderate essential hypertension: Metolazone tablets, USP, 2½ to 5 mg once daily. New patients – MYKROX Tablets (metolazone tablets, USP) (see MYKROX package circular). If considered desirable to switch patients currently on Upstate's metolazone tablets, USP, to MYKROX, the dose should be determined by titration starting at one tablet (½ mg) once daily and increasing to two tablets (1 mg) once daily if needed. Treatment Of Edematous States The time interval required for the initial dosage to produce an effect may vary. Diuresis and saluresis usually begin within one hour and persist for 24 hours or longer. When a desired therapeutic effect has been obtained, it may be advisable to reduce the dose if possible. The daily dose depends on the severity of the patient's condition, sodium intake, and responsiveness. A decision to change the daily dose should be based on the results of thorough clinical and laboratory evaluations. If antihypertensive drugs or diuretics are given concurrently with metolazone tablets, USP, more careful dosage adjustment may be necessary. For patients who tend to experience paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, it may be advisable to employ a larger dose to ensure prolongation of diuresis and saluresis for a full 24-hour period.

A greater proportion of patients had headache response following a 20-mg dose than following a 5- or 10-mg dose (see CLINICAL TRIALS). Individuals may vary in response to doses of Sumatriptan Nasal Spray. The choice of dose should therefore be made on an individual basis, weighing the possible benefit of the 20-mg dose with the potential for a greater risk of adverse events. A 10-mg dose may be achieved by the administration of a single 5-mg dose in each nostril. There is evidence that doses above 20 mg do not provide a greater effect than 20 mg. If the headache returns, the dose may be repeated once after 2 hours, not to exceed a total daily dose of 40 mg. The safety of treating an average of more than 4 headaches in a 30-day period has not been established."

Assess renal function before starting ONGLYZA and periodically thereafter. (2.2) 2.5 mg daily is recommended for patients also taking strong cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5) inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole). (2.3, 7.1) 2.1 Recommended Dosing The recommended dose of ONGLYZA is 2.5 mg or 5 mg once daily taken regardless of meals. ONGLYZA tablets must not be split or cut. 2.2 Patients with Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment for ONGLYZA is recommended for patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCl] >50 mL/min). The dose of ONGLYZA is 2.5 mg once daily for patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, or with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis (creatinine clearance [CrCl] ≤50 mL/min) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.3) ]. ONGLYZA should be administered following hemodialysis. ONGLYZA has not been studied in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. Because the dose of ONGLYZA should be limited to 2.5 mg based upon renal function, assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiation of ONGLYZA and periodically thereafter. Renal function can be estimated from serum creatinine using the Cockcroft-Gault formula or Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula.

Humalog Mix75/25 should not be administered intravenously. Dosage regimens of Humalog Mix75/25 will vary among patients and should be determined by the healthcare provider familiar with the patient’s metabolic needs, eating habits, and other lifestyle variables. Humalog has been shown to be equipotent to Regular human insulin on a molar basis. One unit of Humalog has the same glucose–lowering effect as one unit of Regular human insulin, but its effect is more rapid and of shorter duration. Humalog Mix75/25 has a similar glucose–lowering effect as compared with Humulin 70/30 on a unit for unit basis. The quicker glucose–lowering effect of Humalog is related to the more rapid absorption rate of insulin lispro from subcutaneous tissue. Humalog Mix75/25 starts lowering blood glucose more quickly than Regular human insulin, allowing for convenient dosing immediately before a meal (within 15 minutes). In contrast, mixtures containing Regular human insulin should be given 30 to 60 minutes before a meal. The rate of insulin absorption and consequently the onset of activity are known to be affected by the site of injection, exercise, and other variables. As with all insulin preparations, the time course of action of Humalog Mix75/25 may vary considerably in different individual"

Simulect is for central or peripheral intravenous administration only. Reconstituted Simulect should be given either as a bolus injection or diluted to a volume of 25 mL (10-mg vial) or 50 mL (20-mg vial) with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP and administered as an intravenous infusion over 20 to 30 minutes. Bolus administration may be associated with nausea, vomiting and local reactions, including pain. Simulect should only be administered once it has been determined that the patient will receive the graft and concomitant immunosuppression. Patients previously administered Simulect should only be re-exposed to a subsequent course of therapy with extreme caution due to the potential risk of hypersensitivity (see WARNINGS). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration before administration. After reconstitution, Simulect should be a clear-to-opalescent, colorless solution. If particulate matter is present or the solution is colored, do not use. Care must be taken to assure sterility of the prepared solution because the drug product does not contain any antimicrobial preservatives or bacteriostatic agents. It is recommended that after reconstitution, the solution should be used immediately. If not used immediately, it can be stored at 2ºC to 8ºC (36ºF to 46ºF) for 24 hours or at room temperature for 4 hours. Discard the reconstituted solution if not used within 24 hours. No incompatibility between Simulect and polyvinyl chloride bags or infusion sets has been observed. No data are available on the compatibility of Simulect with other intravenous substances. Other drug substances should not be added or infused simultaneously through the same intravenous line. Adults In adult patients, the recommended regimen is two doses of 20 m"

The pediatric dose should never exceed the adult dose regardless of weight. If circumstances permit, suppressive therapy should begin two weeks prior to exposure. However, failing this in adults, an initial double (loading) dose of 1 g (= 600 mg base), or in children 10 mg base/kg may be taken in two divided doses, six hours apart. The suppressive therapy should be continued for eight weeks after leaving the endemic area. Treatment of uncomplicated malaria due to chloroquine-sensitive Plasmodiumspecies Adults:An initial dose of 1 g salt (= 600 mg base) followed by an additional 500 mg (= 300 mg base) after six to eight hours and a single dose of 500 mg (= 300 mg base) on each of two consecutive days. This represents a total dose of 2.5 g chloroquine phosphate or 1.5 g base in three days. Infants and Children:In infants and children, the recommended dose is 10 mg base/kg followed by 5 mg based/kg at 6, 24 and 36 hours (total dose 25 mg based/kg). The pediatric dose should never exceed the adult dose regardless of weight. The dosage for adults of low body weight and for infants and children should be determined as follows: First dose: 10 mg base per kg (but not exceeding a single dose of 600 mg base). Second dose: (6 hours after first dose) 5 mg base per kg (but not exceeding a single dose of 300 mg base). Third dose: (24 hours afte"

Addison’s Disease In Addison’s disease, the combination of Fludrocortisone Acetate Tablets with a glucocorticoid such as hydrocortisone or cortisone provides substitution therapy approximating normal adrenal activity with minimal risks of unwanted effects. The usual dose is 0.1 mg of Fludrocortisone Acetate Tablets daily, although dosage ranging from 0.1 mg three times a week to 0.2 mg daily has been employed. In the event transient hypertension develops as a consequence of therapy, the dose should be reduced to 0.05 mg daily. Fludrocortisone Acetate Tablets are preferably administered in conjunction with cortisone (10 mg to 37.5 mg daily in divided doses) or hydrocortisone (10 mg to 30 mg daily in divided doses).

(2.3) 2.1 Recommended Dosage Individualize the starting dosage of alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets based on the patient’s current regimen. Alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets should be taken orally twice daily with food with gradual dose escalation to reduce the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects due to metformin. Do not split tablets. Adjust the dosage based on effectiveness and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 25 mg alogliptin and 2000 mg metformin hydrochloride (HCl). 2.2 Recommendations for Use in Renal Impairment Assess renal function prior to initiation of alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets and periodically thereafter. Alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets are contraindicated in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets are not recommended in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 59 mL/min/1.73 m2 because these patients require a lower daily dosage of alogliptin than what is available in the fixed combination alogliptin and metformin HCl tablets product.

It is administered for the initial 2 months of a 6-month or longer treatment regimen for drug-susceptible patients. Patients who are known or suspected to have drug-resistant disease should be treated with regimens individualized to their situation. Pyrazinamide frequently will be an important component of such therapy. Patients with concomitant HIV infection may require longer courses of therapy. Physicians treating such patients should be alert to any revised recommendations from CDC for this group of patients. Usual dose: Pyrazinamide is administered orally, 15 to 30 mg/kg once daily. Older regimens employed 3 or 4 divided doses daily, but most current recommendations are for once a day. Three grams per day should not be exceeded. The CDC recommendations do not exceed 2 g per day when given as a daily regimen (see table). Alternatively, a twice weekly dosing regimen (50 to 75 mg/kg twice weekly based on lean body weight) has been developed to promote patient compliance with a regimen on an outpatient basis. In studies evaluation the twice weekly regimen, doses of pyrazinamide in excess of 3 g twice weekly have been administered. This exceeds the recommended maximum 3 g/daily dose. However, an increased incidence of adverse reactions has not been reported. This table is taken from the CDC-American Thoracic Society joint recommendations. 4 Recommended Drugs for the Initial Treatment of Tuberculosis in Children and Adults Daily Dose Doses based on weight should be adjusted as weight changes.

Note: Barbiturates and ketamine, being chemically incompatible because of precipitate formation, should not be injected from the same syringe. If the ketamine dose is augmented with diazepam, the two drugs must be given separately. Do not mix ketamine hydrochloride and diazepam in syringe or infusion flask. For additional information on the use of diazepam, refer to the WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION sections of the diazepam insert. Preoperative Preparations While vomiting has been reported following ketamine administration, some airway protection may be afforded because of active laryngeal-pharyngeal reflexes. However, since aspiration may occur with ketamine and since protective reflexes may also be diminished by supplementary anesthetics and muscle relaxants, the possibility of aspiration must be considered. Ketamine is recommended for use in the patient whose stomach is not empty when, in the judgment of the practitioner, the benefits of the drug outweigh the possible risks. Atropine, scopolamine, or another drying agent should be given at an appropriate interval prior to induction. Onset and Duration Because of rapid induction following the initial intravenous injection, the patient should be in a supported position during administration. The onset of action of ketamine is rapid; an intravenous dose of 2 mg/kg (1 mg/lb) of body weight usually produces surgical anesthesia within 30 seconds after injection, with the anesthetic effect usually lasting five to ten minutes. If a longer effect is desired, additional increments can be administered intravenously or intramuscularly to maintain anesthesia without producing significant cumulative effects. Intramuscular doses, in a range of 9 to13 mg/kg (4 to 6 mg/lb) usually produce surgical anesthesia within 3 to 4 minutes followin"

(2.6) •Hepatic Impairment: Use a lower starting dose for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. (2.8) •Dose must be individualized to prevent overdose. (2.10) 2.1 Important Dosing Guidelines Bortezomib for injection is for intravenous or subcutaneous use only. Do not administer bortezomib for injection by any other route. Because each route of administration has a different reconstituted concentration, use caution when calculating the volume to be administered. The recommended starting dose of bortezomib for injection is 1.3 mg/m2. Bortezomib for injection is administered intravenously at a concentration of 1 mg/mL, or subcutaneously at a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.10)]. Bortezomib for injection retreatment may be considered for patients with multiple myeloma who had previously responded to treatment with bortezomib for injection and who have relapsed at least six months after completing prior bortezomib for injection treatment. Treatment may be started at the last tolerated dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6)]. When administered intravenously, administer bortezomib for injection as a 3 to 5 second bolus intravenous injection. 2.2 Dosage in Previously Untreated Multiple Myeloma Bortezomib for injection is administered in combination with oral melphalan and oral prednisone for 9, six-week treatment cycles as shown in Table 1.

The dosages suggested in this table are for normal healthy adults and refer to the use of epinephrine-free solutions. When larger volumes are required, only solutions containing epinephrine should be used except in those cases where vasopressor drugs may be contraindicated. There have been adverse event reports of chondrolysis in patients receiving intra-articular infusions of local anesthetics following arthroscopic and other surgical procedures. Lidocaine is not approved for this use (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). These recommended doses serve only as a guide to the amount of anesthetic required for most routine procedures. The actual volumes and concentrations to be used depend on a number of factors such as type and extent of surgical procedure, depth of anesthesia and degree of muscular relaxation required, duration of anesthesia required, and the physical condition of the patient. In all cases the lowest concentration and smallest dose that will produce the desired result should be given. Dosages should be reduced for children and for the elderly and debilitated patients and patients with cardiac and/or liver disease. The onset of anesthesia, the duration of anesthesia and the degree of muscular relaxation are proportional to the volume and concentration (i.e., total dose) of local anesthetic used. Thus, an increase in volume and concentration of Lidocaine Hydrochloride Injection, USP will decrease the onset of anesthesia, prolong the duration of anesthesia, provide a greater degree of muscular relaxation and increase the segmental spread of anesthesia. However, increasing the volume and concentration of Lidocaine Hydrochloride Injection, USP may result in a more profound fall in blood pressure when used in epidural anesthesia.

The daily dosage then may be increased or decreased, preferably at intervals of not less than two days, until an adequate response is achieved. To minimize the sedation, start dosage increases in the evening. By adjustment of dosage, morning hypotension may be prevented without sacrificing control of afternoon blood pressure. When methyldopa is given to patients on other anti-hypertensives, the dose of these agents may need to be adjusted to effect a smooth transition. When methyldopa is given with anti-hypertensives other than thiazides, the initial dosage of methyldopa should be limited to 500 mg daily in divided doses; when methyldopa is added to a thiazide, the dosage of thiazide need not be changed. Maintenance Therapy The usual daily dosage of methyldopa is 500 mg to 2 g in two to four doses. Although occasional patients have responded to higher doses, the maximum recommended daily dosage is 3 g. Once an effective dosage range is attained, a smooth blood pressure response occurs in most patients in 12 to 24 hours. Since methyldopa has a relatively short duration of action, withdrawal is followed by return of hypertension usually within 48 hours. This is not complicated by an overshoot of blood pressure. Occasionally tolerance may occur, usually between the second and third month of therapy. Adding a diuretic or increasing the dosage of methyldopa frequently will restore effective control of blood pressure. A thiazide may be added at any time during methyldopa therapy and is recommended if therapy has not been started with a thiazide or if effective control of blood pressure cannot be maintained on 2 g of methyldopa daily. Methyldopa is largely excreted by the kidney and patients with impaired renal function may respond to smaller doses. Syncope in older patients may be related to an increased sensitivit"

Dantrolene Sodium for Injection should be administered by continuous rapid intravenous push beginning at a minimum dose of 1 mg/kg, and continuing until symptoms subside or the maximum cumulative dose of 10 mg/kg has been reached. If the physiologic and metabolic abnormalities reappear, the regimen may be repeated. It is important to note that administration of Dantrolene Sodium for Injection should be continuous until symptoms subside. The effective dose to reverse the crisis is directly dependent upon the individual's degree of susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia, the amount and time of exposure to the triggering agent, and the time elapsed between onset of the crisis and initiation of treatment. Pediatric Dose Experience to date indicates that the dose of Dantrolene Sodium for Injection for pediatric patients is the same as for adults. Preoperatively Dantrolene Sodium for Injection and/or Dantrolene Sodium Capsules may be administered preoperatively to patients judged malignant hyperthermia susceptible as part of the overall patient management to prevent or attenuate the development of clinical and laboratory signs of malignant hyperthermia. The recommended prophylactic dose of Dantrolene Sodium for Injection is 2.5 mg/kg, starting approximately 1-1/4 hours before anticipated anesthesia and infused over approximately 1 hour. This dose should prevent or attenuate the development of clinical and laboratory signs of malignant hyperthermia provided that the usual precautions, such as avoidance of established malignant hyperthermia triggering agents, are followed. Additional Dantrolene Sodium for Injection may be indicated during anesthesia and surgery because of the appearance of early clinical and/or blood gas signs of malignant hyperthermia or because of prolonged surgery (see al"

Maintenance Dose Dosage may be slowly increased to a total daily dose of 20 mg given in divided doses. The therapeutic dosages most commonly employed have ranged from 6 mg to 15 mg daily given in divided doses. Doses higher than 20 mg usually do not increase efficacy, however a few patients may benefit from further increases up to a daily dose of 40 mg given in divided doses. After initial titration some patients can be maintained adequately on a twice daily dosage regimen. Use With Other Drugs When adding a diuretic or other antihypertensive agent, the dose of prazosin hydrochloride should be reduced to 1 mg or 2 mg three times a day and retitration then carried out. Concomitant administration of prazosin hydrochloride with a PDE-5 inhibitor can result in additive blood pressure lowering effects and symptomatic hypotension; therefore, PDE-5 inhibitor therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose in patients taking prazosin hydrochloride."

    "package_label": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ACCORDING TO PATIENT'S RESPONSE. Captopril and Hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be substituted for the previously titrated individual components. Alternatively, therapy may be instituted with a single tablet of Captopril and Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/15 mg taken once daily. For patients insufficiently responsive to the initial dose, additional captopril or hydrochlorothiazide may be added as individual components or by using Captopril and Hydrochlorothiazide tablets 50 mg/15 mg, 25 mg/25 mg or 50 mg/25 mg, or divided doses may be used. Because the full effect of a given dose may not be attained for 6 to 8 weeks, dosage adjustments should generally be made at 6 week intervals, unless the clinical situation demands more rapid adjustment. In general, daily doses of captopril should not exceed 150 mg and of hydrochlorothiazide should not exceed 50 mg. Captopril and Hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be taken one hour before meals. Dosage Adjustment in Renal ImpairmentBecause captopril and hydrochlorothiazide are excreted primarily by the kidneys, excretion rates are reduced in patients with impaired renal function. These patients will take longer to reach steady-state captopril levels and will reach higher steady-state levels for a given daily dose than patients with normal renal function. Therefore, these patients may respond to smaller or less frequent doses of Captopril and Hydrochlorothiazide. After the desired therapeutic effect has been achieved, the dose intervals should be increased or the total daily dose reduced until the minimal effective dose is achieved. When concomitant diuretic therapy is required in patients with severe renal impairment, a loop diuretic (e.g., furosemide), rather than a thiazide diuretic is preferred for use with captopril; therefore, for patients with severe renal dysfunction the captopril-hydrochlorothiazide combination tablet is not usually recommended.

Factors of consideration are the patients age, weight, and condition. Sedation For sedation, the drug may be administered in single doses of 30 to 120 mg repeated at intervals; frequency will be determined by the patient's response. It is generally considered that no more than 400 mg of phenobarbital should be administered during a 24-hour period. Adults: Daytime Sedation: 30 to 120 mg daily in 2 to 3 divided doses. Oral Hypnotic: 100 to 200 mg Anticonvulsant Use Clinical laboratory reference values should be used to determine the therapeutic anticonvulsant level of phenobarbital in the serum. To achieve the blood levels considered therapeutic in pediatric patients, higher per-kilogram dosages are generally necessary for phenobarbital and most other anticonvulsants. In pediatric patients and infants, phenobarbital at a loading dose to 15 to 20 mg/kg produces blood levels of about 20 mcg/mL shortly after administration. Phenobarbital has been used in the treatment and prophylaxis of febrile seizures. However, it has not been established that prevention of febrile seizures influences the subsequent development of epilepsy. Adults: 60 to 200 mg/day. Pediatric Patients: 3 to 6 mg/kg/day. Special Patient Population Dosage should be reduced in the elderly or debilitated because these patients may be more sensitive to barbiturates. Dosage should be reduced for patients with impaired renal function or hepatic disease."

    "package_label": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Zonisamide capsules are recommended as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial seizures in adults. Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients below the age of 16 have not been established. Zonisamide should be administered once or twice daily, using 25 mg, 50 mg or 100 mg capsules. Zonisamide capsules are given orally and can be taken with or without food. Capsules should be swallowed whole. Adults over Age 16 The prescriber should be aware that, because of the long half-life of zonisamide, up to two weeks may be required to achieve steady state levels upon reaching a stable dose or following dosage adjustment. Although the regimen described below is one that has been shown to be tolerated, the prescriber may wish to prolong the duration of treatment at the lower doses in order to fully assess the effects of zonisamide at steady state, noting that many of the side effects of zonisamide are more frequent at doses of 300 mg per day and above. Although there is some evidence of greater response at doses above 100 to 200 mg/day, the increase appears small and formal dose-response studies have not been conducted. The initial dose of zonisamide capsules should be 100 mg daily. After two weeks, the dose may be increased to 200 mg/day for at least two weeks. It can be increased to 300 mg/day and 400 mg/day, with the dose stable for at least two weeks to achieve steady state at each level. Evidence from controlled trials suggests that zonisamide doses of 100 to 600 mg/day are effective, but there is no suggestion of increasing response above 400 mg/day (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies subsection). There is little experience with doses greater than 600 mg/day. Patients with Renal or Hepatic Disease Because zonisamide is metabolized in the liver and excreted by the kidneys, patients with renal or hepatic disease should be treated with caution, and might require slower titration and more frequent monitoring (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY"

SURVANTA should be administered by or under the supervision of clinicians experienced in intubation, ventilator management, and general care of premature infants. The administration of SURVANTA is facilitated if one person administers the dose while another person positions and monitors the infant. Before administering SURVANTA, assure proper placement and patency of the endotracheal tube. At the discretion of the clinician, the endotracheal tube may be suctioned before administering SURVANTA. The infant should be allowed to stabilize before proceeding with dosing. Administer SURVANTA intratracheally by instillation through a 5 French end-hole catheter. Recommended Dosage Each dose of SURVANTA is 100 mg of phospholipids/kg birth weight (4 mL/kg). In the prevention strategy, in premature infants with evidence of surfactant deficiency, give the first dose of SURVANTA as soon as possible, preferably within 15 minutes of birth. To treat infants with RDS confirmed by radiographic and clinical findings, give the first dose of SURVANTA as soon as possible, preferably by 8 hours of age. Four doses of SURVANTA can be administered in the first 48 hours of life. Doses should be given no more frequently than every 6 hours. The need for additional doses of SURVANTA is determined by evidence of continuing respiratory distress. Radiographic confirmation of RDS should be obtained before administering additional doses to those who received a prevention dose. Preparation of the SURVANTA Suspension SURVANTA should be inspected visually for discoloration prior to administration. The color of SURVANTA is off-white to light brown. If settling occurs during storage, swirl the vial gently (DO NOT SHAKE) to redisperse. Do not filter SURVANTA. Some foaming at the surface may occur during handling and is inherent in the nature of the product. SURVANTA is stored refrigerated (36°F to 46°F [2°"

Increase the dose in weekly increments of 400 mg to 600 mg once daily, based on clinical response and tolerability, to a recommended maintenance dosage of 800 mg to 1600 mg once daily. (2.2) Pediatric Patients: The recommended dosage of APTIOM is based on body weight and is administered orally once daily. Increase the dose in weekly intervals based on clinical response and tolerability, to the recommended maintenance dosage. (2.2) Patients with Moderate or Severe Renal Impairment: Reduce dosage by 50%. (2.4) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions Instruct patients to administer APTIOM either as whole or as crushed tablets. Instruct patients to take APTIOM either with or without food. The APTIOM dosing regimen depends on age, weight, and renal function. 2.2 General Dosing Recommendations Monotherapy and Adjunctive Therapy Adult Patients The recommended initial dosage of APTIOM is 400 mg administered orally once daily. For some patients, treatment may be initiated at 800 mg once daily if the need for seizure reduction outweighs an increased risk of adverse reactions during initiation [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Dosage should be increased in weekly increments of 400 mg to 600 mg, based on clinical response and tolerability, to a recommended maintenance dosage of 800 mg to 1600 mg once daily. For patients on APTIOM monotherapy, the 800 mg once daily maintenance dose should generally be considered in patients who are unable to tolerate a 1200 mg daily dose. For patients on APTIOM adjunctive therapy, the 1600 mg daily dose should generally be considered in patients who did not achieve a satisfactory response with a 1200 mg daily dose.

Daily dosage may be adjusted up to 80 mg twice daily. Dose adjustments should occur at intervals of not less than 2 days. Safety and efficacy has been demonstrated in doses up to 100 mg twice daily. The lowest effective dose should be used. ( 2.2) Acute treatment of manic/mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder: Initiate at 40 mg twice daily. Increase to 60 mg or 80 mg twice daily on day 2 of treatment. Subsequent dose adjustments should be based on tolerability and efficacy within the range of 40 - 80 mg twice daily. ( 2.3) Maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder as an adjunct to lithium or valproate: Continue treatment at the same dose on which the patient was initially stabilized, within the range of 40 - 80 mg twice daily. ( 2.3) 2.1 Administration Information for Ziprasidone Capsules Administer Ziprasidone capsules orally with food. Swallow capsules whole, do not open, crush, or chew the capsules. 2.2 Schizophrenia Dose Selection Ziprasidone capsules should be administered at an initial daily dose of 20 mg twice daily with food. In some patients, daily dosage may subsequently be adjusted on the basis of individual clinical status up to 80 mg twice daily. Dosage adjustments, if indicated, should generally occur at intervals of not less than 2 days, as steady-state is achieved within 1 to 3 days. In order to ensure use of the lowest effective dose, patients should ordinarily be observed for improvement for several weeks before upward dosage adjustment. Efficacy in schizophrenia was demonstrated in a dose range of 20 mg to 100 mg twice daily in short-term, placebo-controlled clinical trials. There were trends toward dose response within the range of 20 mg to 80 mg twice daily, but results were not consistent. An increase to a dose greater than 80 mg twice daily is not generally recommended. The safety of doses above 1"

It is compatible with 5% dextrose in water, lactated Ringer’s and normal saline solutions. If flumazenil injection is drawn into a syringe or mixed with any of these solutions, it should be discarded after 24 hours. For optimum sterility, flumazenil injection should remain in the vial until just before use. As with all parenteral drug products, flumazenil injection should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.To minimize the likelihood of pain at the injection site, flumazenil injection should be administered through a freely running intravenous infusion into a large vein. Reversal of Conscious Sedation Adult Patients For the reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines administered for conscious sedation, the recommended initial dose of flumazenil injection is 0.2 mg (2 mL) administered intravenously over 15 seconds. If the desired level of consciousness is not obtained after waiting an additional 45 seconds, a second dose of 0.2 mg (2 mL) can be injected and repeated at 60 second intervals where necessary (up to a maximum of 4 additional times) to a maximum total dose of 1 mg (10 mL). The dosage should be individualized based on the patient’s response, with most patients responding to doses of 0.6 mg to 1 mg (see INDIVIDUALIZATION OF DOSAGE ).In the event of resedation, repeated doses may be administered at 20 minute intervals as needed. For repeat treatment, no more than 1 mg (given as 0.2 mg/min) should be administered at any one time, and no more than 3 mg should be given in any one hour.It is recommended that flumazenil be administered as the series of small injections described (not as a single bolus injection) to allow the practitioner to control the reversal of sedation to the approximate endpoint desired and to minimize the possibility of adverse effects (see INDIVIDUALI"

Amenorrhea and rapid response to painful symptoms is best achieved at this dosage level. Gradual downward titration to a dose sufficient to maintain amenorrhea may be considered depending upon patient response. For mild cases, an initial daily dose of 200 mg to 400 mg given in two divided doses is recommended and may be adjusted depending on patient response. Therapy should begin during menstruation. Otherwise, appropriate tests should be performed to ensure that the patient is not pregnant while on therapy with danazol capsules (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS). It is essential that therapy continue uninterrupted for 3 to 6 months but may be extended to 9 months if necessary. After termination of therapy, if symptoms recur, treatment can be reinstituted. Hereditary Angioedema The dosage requirements for continuous treatment of hereditary angioedema with danazol capsules should be individualized on the basis of the clinical response of the patient. It is recommended that the patient be started on 200 mg, two or three times a day. After a favorable initial response is obtained in terms of prevention of episodes of edematous attacks, the proper continuing dosage should be determined by decreasing the dosage by 50% or less at intervals of one to three months or longer if frequency of attacks prior to treatment dictates. If an attack occurs, the daily dosage may be increased by up to 200 mg. During the dose adjusting phase, close monitoring of the patient's response is indicated, particularly if the patient has a history of airway involvement."

Food does not affect the oral bioavailability of tinidazole [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)]. Alcoholic beverages should be avoided when taking tinidazole and for 3 days afterwards [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1)]. 2.2 Compounding of the Oral Suspension For those unable to swallow tablets, tinidazole tablets may be crushed in artificial cherry syrup to be taken with food. Procedure for Extemporaneous Pharmacy Compounding of the Oral Suspension: Pulverize four 500 mg oral tablets with a mortar and pestle. Add approximately 10 mL of cherry syrup to the powder and mix until smooth. Transfer the suspension to a graduated amber container. Use several small rinses of cherry syrup to transfer any remaining drug in the mortar to the final suspension for a final volume of 30 mL. The suspension of crushed tablets in artificial cherry syrup is stable for 7 days at room temperature. When this suspension is used, it should be shaken well before each administration. 2.3 Trichomoniasis The recommended "

Patients with depletion of intravascular volume should have the condition corrected or telmisartan tablets should be initiated under close medical supervision (see WARNINGS, Hypotension in Volume-Depleted Patients ). Patients with biliary obstructive disorders or hepatic insufficiency should have treatment started under close medical supervision (see PRECAUTIONS ). Hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 mg to 50 mg once daily. To minimize dose-independent side effects, it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy. The side effects (see WARNINGS ) of telmisartan are generally rare and apparently independent of dose; those of hydrochlorothiazide are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily hypokalemia) and dose-independent phenomena (e.g., pancreatitis), the former much more common than the latter. Therapy with any combination of telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide will be associated with both sets of dose-independent side effects. Micardis® HCT (telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide) tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. MICARDIS HCT tablets may be administered with or without food. Replacement Therapy The combination may be substituted for the titrated components. Dose Titration by Clinical Effect MICARDIS HCT tablets are available as tablets containing either telmisartan 40 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg, or telmisartan 80 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg or 25 mg. A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with telmisartan monotherapy 80 mg (see above) may be switched to MICARDIS HCT tablets, telmisartan 80 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg once daily, and finally titrated up to 160/25 mg, if necessary.

The usual maintenance dosage range is 20-40 mg per day administered as a single dose or in two equally divided doses. A dose of 80 mg gives an increased response, but experience with this dose is limited. The divided regimen was more effective in controlling trough (pre-dosing) blood pressure than the same dose given as a once-daily regimen. Dosage adjustment should be based on measurement of peak (2-6 hours after dosing) and trough responses. If a once-daily regimen does not give adequate trough response, an increase in dosage or divided administration should be considered. If blood pressure is not controlled with benazepril hydrochloride tablets alone, a diuretic can be added. Total daily doses above 80 mg have not been evaluated. Concomitant administration of benazepril hydrochloride tablets with potassium supplements, potassium salt substitutes, or potassium-sparing diuretics can lead to increases of serum potassium (see PRECAUTIONS). In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic hypotension occasionally can occur following the initial dose of benazepril hydrochloride tablets. To reduce the likelihood of hypotension, the diuretic should, if possible, be discontinued two to three days prior to beginning therapy with benazepril hydrochloride tablets (see WARNINGS). Then, if blood pressure is not controlled with benazepril hydrochloride tablets alone, diuretic therapy should be resumed. If the diuretic cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 5 mg benazepril hydrochloride tablets should be used to avoid excessive hypotension. Pediatrics In children, doses of benazepril hydrochloride between 0.1 and 0.6 mg/kg once daily have been studied, and doses greater than 0.1 mg/kg were shown to reduce blood pressure (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacodynamics). Based on this, the recommended starting dose of benaze"

The determination of dosage for any particular patient must take into consideration the severity and nature of the infection, the susceptibility of the causative organism, the integrity of the patient's host-defense mechanisms, and the status of renal function and hepatic function. The duration of treatment depends upon the severity of infection. The usual duration is 7 to 14 days; however, for severe and complicated infections more prolonged therapy may be required. Ciprofloxacin should be administered at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after magnesium/aluminum antacids, or sucralfate, Videx® (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder for oral solution, other highly buffered drugs, or other products containing calcium, iron or zinc. ADULT DOSAGE GUIDELINES Infection Severity Dose Frequency Usual Durations † * used in conjunction with metronidazole † Generally ciprofloxacin should be continued for at least 2 days after the signs and symptoms of infection have disappeared, except for inhalational anthrax (post-exposure). ** Drug administration should begin as soon as possible after suspected or confirmed exposure.

Prevention of CMV disease in transplant recipients (2.4) Induction: 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over one hour) every 12 hours for 7 to 14 days.Maintenance: 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over one hour) once daily, 7 days per week, or 6 mg/kg once daily, 5 days per week until 100 to 120 days post-transplantation. Adults with renal impairment: Adjust dosage based on creatinine clearance. (2.5). 2.1 Important Dosing and Administration Information To avoid phlebitis/pain at the infusion site, ganciclovir for injection must only be administered by intravenous infusion over one hour, preferably via plastic cannula, into a vein with adequate blood flow to permit rapid dilution and distribution. Do not administer ganciclovir for injection by rapid or bolus intravenous injection which may increase toxicity as a result of excessive plasma levels. The recommended dosage and infusion rate for ganciclovir should not be exceeded. Do not administer the reconstituted ganciclovir for injection solution intramuscularly or subcutaneously because it may result in severe tissue irritation due to high pH [see Description (11)]. Administration of ganciclovir should be accompanied by adequate hydration. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. 2.2 Testing Before and During Treatment Females of reproductive potential should undergo pregnancy testing before initiation of treatment with ganciclovir [see Warni"

Adult Patients The dose recommendation is based on clinical studies with peripheral venous bolus dosing. Central venous (CVP or other) administration of adenosine has not been systematically studied. The recommended intravenous doses for adults are as fo Initial dose: 6 mg given as a rapid intravenous bolus (administered over a 1 to 2 second pe Repeat administration: If the first dose does not result in elimination of the supraventricular tachycardia within 1 to 2 minutes, 12 mg should be given as a rapid intravenous bolus. This 12 mg dose may be repeated a second time if required. Pediatric Patients The dosages used in neonates, infants, children and adolescents were equivalent to those administered to adults on a weight basis. Pediatric Patients with a Body Weight < 50 kg: Initial dose: Give 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg as a rapid IV bolus given either centrally or peripherally. A saline flush should follow. Repeat administration: If conversion of PSVT does not occur within 1 to 2 minutes, additional bolus injections of adenosine can be administered at incrementally higher doses, increasing the amount given by 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg. Follow each bolus with a saline flush. This process should continue until sinus rhythm is established or a maximum single dose of 0.3 mg/kg is used. Pediatric Patients with a Body Weight ≥ 50 kg: Administer the adult dose. Doses greater than 12 mg are not recommended for adult and pediatric patients.

The maximum recommended infusion rate is 1 mL/minute (100 mg/minute). Additional important administration instructions regarding Calcium Chloride Injection are as follows: • Do not use intramuscularly or subcutaneously to avoid tissue necrosis calcinosis cutis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].• Visually inspect for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration (the solution is clear, and the seal is intact). Do not administer if the solution is unclear or the seal is not intact.• Stop the administration if the patient complains of any administration-related discomfort; administration may be resumed when symptoms disappear.• Discard the unused portion.• If time permits, allow the solution to warm to body temperature. 2.2 Recommended Dosage and Administration The recommended dose range of Calcium Chloride Injection in: • Adults is from 200 mg to 1,000 mg.• Pediatric patients is from 2.7 to 5 mg/kg of calcium chloride. Dosing of this Calcium Chloride Injection product is not possible in patients who require doses less than 200 mg because the recommended dose cannot be achieved with the supplied syringe. For patients who require doses less than 200 mg, use another calcium chloride injection product that allows dosing of less than 200 mg. Individualize the dose for a patient within these dose ranges depending on serum ionized calcium level, severity of hypocalcemia symptoms, and the acuity of hypocalcemia onset. Repeated injections may be required because of rapid excretion of calcium. 2.3 Recommended Starting Dose in Patients with Renal Impairment The recommended starting dose of Calcium Chloride Injection in [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]: • Adu"

Single Agent Therapy Carboplatin injection, as a single agent, has been shown to be effective in patients with recurrent ovarian carcinoma at a dosage of 360 mg/m2 IV on day 1 every 4 weeks (alternatively see Formula Dosing ). In general, however, single intermittent courses of carboplatin should not be repeated until the neutrophil count is at least 2,000 and the platelet count is at least 100,000. Combination Therapy with Cyclophosphamide In the chemotherapy of advanced ovarian cancer, an effective combination for previously untreated patients consists of: Carboplatin - 300 mg/m2 IV on day 1 every 4 weeks for 6 cycles (alternatively see Formula Dosing ). Cyclophosphamide - 600 mg/m2 IV on day 1 every 4 weeks for 6 cycles. For directions regarding the use and administration of cyclophosphamide please refer to its package insert (see CLINICAL STUDIES ). Intermittent courses of carboplatin in combination with cyclophosphamide should not be repeated until the neutrophil count is at least 2,000 and the platelet count is at least 100,000. Dose Adjustment Recommendations Pretreatment platelet count and performance status are important prognostic factors for severity of myelosuppression in previously treated patients. The suggested dose adjustments for single agent or combination therapy shown in the table below are modified from controlled trials in previously treated and untreated patients with ovarian carcinoma. Blood counts were done weekly, and the recommendations are based on the lowest post-treatment platelet or neutrophil value. Platelets Neutrophils Adjusted Dose Percentages apply to carboplatin injection as a single agent or to both carboplatin and cyclophosphamide i"

    "package_label": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Labetalol hydrochloride injection is intended for intravenous use in hospitalized patients. DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED depending upon the severity of hypertension and the response of the patient during dosing. Patients should always be kept in a supine position during the period of intravenous drug administration. A substantial fall in blood pressure on standing should be expected in these patients. The patient's ability to tolerate an upright position should be established before permitting any ambulation, such as using toilet facilities. Either of two methods of administration of labetalol hydrochloride injection may be used: a) repeated intravenous injections, b) slow continuous infusion. Repeated Intravenous Injection Initially, labetalol hydrochloride injection should be given in a dose of 20 mg labetalol HCl (which corresponds to 0.25 mg/kg for an 80 kg patient) by slow intravenous injection over a 2-minute period. Immediately before the injection and at 5 and 10 minutes after injection, supine blood pressure should be measured to evaluate response. Additional injections of 40 mg or 80 mg can be given at 10 minute intervals until a desired supine blood pressure is achieved or a total of 300 mg labetalol HCl has been injected. The maximum effect usually occurs within 5 minutes of each injection. Slow Continuous Infusion Labetalol hydrochloride injection is prepared for continuous intravenous infusion by diluting the contents with commonly used intravenous fluids (see below). Examples of methods of preparing the infusion solution are: The contents of either two 20 mL vials (40 mL), or one 40 mL vial, are added to 160 mL of a commonly used intravenous fluid such that the resultant 200 mL of solution contains 200 mg of labetalol hydrochloride, 1 mg per mL. The diluted solution should be administered at a rate of 2 mL/min to deliver 2 mg/min. Alternatively, the contents of either two 20 mL vials (40 mL), or one 40 mL vial, of labetalol "

Deviations from this dosage regimen are not advised. If the patient does not respond to the initial course of cladribine for Hairy Cell Leukemia, it is unlikely that they will benefit from additional courses. Physicians should consider delaying or discontinuing the drug if neurotoxicity or renal toxicity occurs (see WARNINGS). Specific risk factors predisposing to increased toxicity from cladribine have not been defined. In view of the known toxicities of agents of this class, it would be prudent to proceed carefully in patients with known or suspected renal insufficiency or severe bone marrow impairment of any etiology. Patients should be monitored closely for hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS). Preparation and Administration of Intravenous Solutions Cladribine must be diluted with the designated diluent prior to administration. Since the drug product does not contain any antimicrobial preservative or bacteriostatic agent, aseptic technique and proper environmental precautions must be observed in preparation of cladribine solutions. To prepare a single daily dose Cladribine injection should be passed through a sterile 0.22µm disposable hydrophilic syringe filter prior to introduction into the infusion bag, prior to each daily infusion. Add the calculated dose (0.09 mg/kg or 0.09 mL/kg) of cladribine through a sterile filter to an infusion bag containing 500 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection. Infuse continuously over 24 hours. Repeat daily for a total of 7 consecutive days. The use of 5% dextrose as a diluent is not recommended because of increased degradation of cladribine. Admixtures of cladribine are chemically and physically stable for at least 24 hours at room temperature under normal room fluorescent light"

Dose may be adjusted in 50 or 100 mg increments up or down.As with any antiarrhythmic drug, clinical and electrocardiographic evaluation (including Holter monitoring if necessary for evaluation) are needed to determine whether the desired antiarrhythmic effect has been obtained and to guide titration and dose adjustment.Satisfactory control can be achieved in most patients by 200 to 300 mg given every eight hours with food or antacid. If satisfactory response has not been achieved at 300 mg q8h, and the patient tolerates mexiletine well, a dose of 400 mg q8h may be tried. As the severity of CNS side effects increases with total daily dose, the dose should not exceed 1200 mg/day.In general, patients with renal failure will require the usual doses of mexiletine hydrochloride. Patients with severe liver disease, however, may require lower doses and must be monitored closely. Similarly, marked right-sided congestive heart failure can reduce hepatic metabolism and reduce the needed dose. Plasma level may also be affected by certain concomitant drugs (seePRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).Loading Dose: When rapid control of ventricular arrhythmia is essential, an initial loading dose of 400 mg of mexiletine hydrochloride may be administered, followed by a 200 mg dose in eight hours. Onset of therapeutic effect is usually observed within 30 minutes to two hours.Q12H Dosage Schedule: Some patients responding to mexiletine may be transferred to a 12 hour dosage schedule to improve convenience and compliance. If adequate suppression is achieved on a mexiletine hydrochloride dose of 300 mg or l"

Prime ALVESCO Inhalation Aerosol before using for the first time by actuating 3 times prior to using the first dose from a new canister or when the inhaler has not been used for more than 10 days. Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief. Maximum benefit may not be achieved for four weeks or longer after initiation. After asthma stability has been achieved, it is desirable to titrate to the lowest effective dosage to reduce the possibility of side effects.

The safety and efficacy of ALVESCO when administered in excess of the highest recommended doses has not been established. FOR ORAL INHALATION ONLY (2.1) 1Prednisone should be reduced gradually, no faster than 2.5 mg/day on a weekly basis, beginning after at least 1 week of therapy with ALVESCO.

Therapy with NIASPAN must be initiated at 500 mg at bedtime in order to reduce the incidence and severity of side effects which may occur during early therapy. The recommended dose escalation is shown in Table 1 below. Table 1. Recommended Dosing Week(s) Daily dose NIASPAN Dosage INITIALTITRATION 1 to 4 500 mg 1 NIASPAN 500 mg tablet at bedtime SCHEDULE 5 to 8 1000 mg 1 NIASPAN 1000 mg tablet or 2 NIASPAN 500 mg tablets at bedtime * 1500 mg 2 NIASPAN 750 mg tablets or 3 NIASPAN 500 mg tablets at bedtime * 2000 mg 2 NIASPAN 1000 mg tablets or 4 NIASPAN 500 mg tablets at bedtime * After Week 8, titrate to patient response and tolerance. If response to 1000 mg daily is inadequate, increase dose to 1500 mg daily; may subsequently increase dose to 2000 mg daily. Daily dose should not be increased more than 500 mg in a 4-week period, and doses above 2000 mg daily are not recommended. Women may respond at lower doses than men. Maintenance Dose The daily dosage of NIASPAN should not be increased by more than 500 mg in any 4–week period. The recommended maintenance dose is 1000 mg (two 500 mg tablets or one 1000 mg tablet) to 2000 mg (two 1000 mg tablets or four 500 mg tablets) once daily at bedtime. Doses greater than 2000 mg daily are not recommended. Women may respond at lower NIASPAN doses than men [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Single-dose bioavailability studies have demonstrated that two of the 500 mg and one of the 1000 mg tablet strengths are interchangeable but three of the 500 mg and two of the 750 mg tablet strengths are not interchangeable. If lipid response to NIASPAN alone is insufficient or if higher doses of NIASPAN are not well tolerated, some patients may benefit from combination therapy with a bile acid binding resin or statin [see Drug Interactions (7.3) , Concomitant Therapy below and Clinical Studies ("

The lowest dose needed to provide effective anesthesia should be administered. For specific techniques and procedures refer to standard dental manuals and textbooks.For infiltration and block injections in the upper or lower jaw, the average dose of 1 cartridge will usually suffice.Each cartridge contains 1.7 mL (34 mg of 2% or 51 mg of 3%).5.3 cartridges (180 mg of the 2% solution or 270 mg of the 3% solution) are usually adequate to effect anesthesia of the entire oral cavity. Whenever a larger dose seems to be necessary for an extensive procedure, the maximum dose should be calculated accordlng to the patient's weight. A dose of up to 3 mg per pound of body weight may be administered. At any single dental sitting the total dose for all injected sites should not exceed 400 mg in adults.The maximum pediatric dose should be carefully calculated :Maxlmum Dose for pediatric population =Child's Weight ( lbs )× Maximum Recommended Dose 150 For Adults (400 mg)The following table, approximating these calculations, may also be used as a guide.

For serious infections, the intravenous route should be used.PIPRACIL should not be mixed with an aminoglycoside in a syringe or infusion bottle since this can result in inactivation of the aminoglycoside.The maximum daily dose for adults is usually 24 g/day, although higher doses have been used.Intramuscular injections (see NOTE) should be limited to 2 g per injection site. This route of administration has been used primarily in the treatment of patients with uncomplicated gonorrhea and urinary tract infections.DOSAGE RECOMMENDATIONS Type of InfectionUsual Total Daily Dose †One g of probenecid should be given orally one-half hour prior to injection.

Because of the possible physical incompatibilities, Methylprednisolone Sodium Succinate for Injection should not be diluted or mixed with other solutions. Use only the Bacteriostatic Water For Injection with Benzyl Alcohol when reconstituting Methylprednisolone Sodium Succinate (see DESCRIPTION ). Use within 48 hours after mixing. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. This preparation may be administered by intravenous injection, by intravenous infusion, or by intramuscular injection, the preferred method for initial emergency use being intravenous injection. Following the initial emergency period, consideration should be given to employing a longer acting injectable preparation or an oral preparation. There are reports of cardiac arrhythmias and/or cardiac arrest following the rapid administration of large IV doses of Methylprednisolone Sodium Succinate (greater than 0.5 gram administered over a period of less than 10 minutes). Bradycardia has been reported during or after the administration of large doses of Methylprednisolone Sodium Succinate, and may be unrelated to the speed or duration of infusion. When high dose therapy is desired, the recommended dose of Methylprednisolone Sodium Succinate Sterile Powder is 30 mg/kg administered intravenously over at least 30 minutes. This dose may be repeated every 4 to 6 hours for 48 hours. In general, high dose corticosteroid therapy should be continued only until the patient's condition has stabilized; usually not beyond 48 to 72 hours. In other indications, initial dosage will vary from 10 to 40 mg of methylprednisolone depending on the specific disease entity being treated.

Shake well before use. Do not use if there is evidence of excessive creaming or aggregation, if large droplets are visible, or if there are other forms of phase separation indicating that the stability of the product has been compromised. Slight creaming, which should disappear after shaking, may be visible upon prolonged standing. Do not use if there is evidence of separation of the phases of the emulsion. Propofol injectable emulsion with EDTA inhibits microbial growth for up to 12 hours, as demonstrated by test data for representative USP microorganisms. Product is packaged under nitrogen. For general anesthesia or monitored anesthesia care (MAC) sedation, propofol injectable emulsion should be administered only by persons trained in the administration of general anesthesia and not involved in the conduct of the surgical/diagnostic procedure. Sedated patients should be continuously monitored, and equipment for maintaining a patent airway, providing artificial ventilation, administering supplemental oxygen, and instituting cardiovascular resuscitation must be immediately available. Patients should be continuously monitored for early signs of hypotension, apnea, airway obstruction, and/or oxygen desaturation. These cardiorespiratory effects are more likely to occur following rapid bolus administration, especially in the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients. For sedation of intubated, mechanically ventilated adult patients in the Intensive Care Unit, propofol should be administered only by persons skilled in the management of critically ill patients and trained in cardiovascular resuscitation and airway management.

For the management of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, intravenous infusions of dilute solutions of magnesium (1% to 8%) are often given in combination with intramuscular injections of 50% Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP. Therefore, in the clinical conditions cited below, both forms of therapy are noted, as appropriate. Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5-7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. In Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. To initiate therapy, 4 g of Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection may be administered intravenously. The rate of I.V. infusion should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute, or 3.75 mL of a 4% concentration (or its equivalent) per minute, except in severe eclampsia with seizures. Simultaneously, 4 to 5 g (32.5 to 40.6 mEq) of magnesium sulfate may be administered intramuscularly into each buttock using undiluted 50% Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP. After the initial I.V. dose, some clinicians administer 1 to 2 g/hour by constant I.V. infusion. Subsequent intramuscular doses of 4 to 5 g of magnesium sulfate may be injected into alternate buttocks every four hours, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex, adequate respiratory function, and absence of signs of magnesium toxicity. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g magnesium sulfate should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained and the maximum dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 g per 48 hours.

(2.2) 2.1 Recommended Dose The dose of TRUVADA is one tablet (containing 200 mg of emtricitabine and 300 mg of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) once daily taken orally with or without food. 2.2 Dose Adjustment for Renal Impairment Significantly increased drug exposures occurred when EMTRIVA or VIREAD were administered to subjects with moderate to severe renal impairment [see EMTRIVA or VIREAD Package Insert]. Therefore, the dosing interval of TRUVADA should be adjusted in patients with baseline creatinine clearance 30–49 mL/min using the recommendations in Table 1. These dosing interval recommendations are based on modeling of single-dose pharmacokinetic data in non-HIV infected subjects. The safety and effectiveness of these dosing interval adjustment recommendations have not been clinically evaluated in patients with moderate renal impairment, therefore clinical response to treatment and renal function should be closely monitored in these patients [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50–80 mL/min). Routine monitoring of calculated creatinine clearance and serum phosphorus should be performed in patients with mild renal impairment [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Table 1 Dosage Adjustment for Patients with Altered Creatinine Clearance Creatinine Clearance (mL/min)Calculated using ideal (lean) body weight ≥50 30–49 <30 (Including Patients Requiring Hemodialysis) Recommended Dosing Interval Every 24 hours Every 48 hours TRUVADA should not be administered."

Principles In order to eradicate the leukemic cells and induce a complete remission, a profound suppression of the bone marrow is usually required. Evaluation of both the peripheral blood and bone marrow is mandatory in the formulation of appropriate treatment plans. It is recommended that the dosage of daunorubicin hydrochloride be reduced in instances of hepatic or renal impairment. For example, using serum bilirubin and serum creatinine as indicators of liver and kidney function, the following dose modifications are recommended: Serum Bilirubin Serum Creatinine Dose Reduction 1.2 to 3 mg% — 25% >3 mg% — 50% — >3 mg% 50% Representative Dose Schedules and Combination for the Approved Indication of Remission Induction in Adult Acute Nonlymphocytic Leukemia In Combination For patients under age 60, daunorubicin hydrochloride 45 mg/m2/day IV on days 1, 2, and 3 of the first course and on days 1, 2 of subsequent courses AND cytosine arabinoside 100 mg/m2/day IV infusion daily for 7 days for the first course and for 5 days for subsequent courses. For patients 60 years of age and above, daunorubicin hydrochloride 30 mg/m2/day IV on days 1, 2, and 3 of the first course and on days 1, 2 of subsequent courses AND cytosine arabinoside 100 mg/m2/day IV infusion daily for 7 days for the first course and for 5 days for subsequent courses. This daunorubicin hydrochloride dose-reduction is based on a single study and may not be appropriate if optimal supportive care is available. The attainment of a normal-appearing bone marrow may require up to three courses of induction therapy. Evaluation of the bone marrow following recovery from the previous course of induction therapy determines whether a further course of induction treatment is required.

A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be re-evaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (e.g., 3-month to 6-month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary (see BOXED WARNINGS and WARNINGS ). For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. Divigel® (estradiol gel) 0.1%, at doses of 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 g/day, is indicated for topical use in the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause. Each gram of Divigel® contains 1 mg of estradiol. Patients should be treated with the lowest effective dose of Divigel®. Generally, women should be started at 0.25 gram Divigel® daily. Subsequent dosage adjustments may be made based upon the individual patient response. This dose should be periodically reassessed by the healthcare provider. Divigel® should be applied once daily on the skin of either the right or left upper thigh. The application surface area should be about 5 by 7 inches (approximately the size of two palm prints). The entire contents of a unit dose packet should be applied each day. To avoid potential skin irritation, Divigel® should be applied to the right or left upper thigh on alternating days. Divigel® should not be applied on the face, breasts, or irritated skin or in or around the vagina. After application, the gel should be allowed to dry before dressing. The application site should not be washed within 1 hour after applying Divigel®. Contact"

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. This preparation may be administered by intravenous injection, by intravenous infusion, or by intramuscular injection, the preferred method for initial emergency use being intravenous injection. Following the initial emergency period, consideration should be given to employing a longer acting injectable preparation or an oral preparation. Therapy is initiated by administering SOLU-CORTEF Sterile Powder intravenously over a period of 30 seconds (e.g., 100 mg) to 10 minutes (e.g., 500 mg or more). In general, high dose corticosteroid therapy should be continued only until the patient's condition has stabilized, usually not beyond 48 hours to 72 hours. When high dose hydrocortisone therapy must be continued beyond 48 –72 hours, hypernatremia may occur. Under such circumstances, it may be desirable to replace SOLU-CORTEF with a corticoid such as methylprednisolone sodium succinate which causes little or no sodium retention. The initial dose of SOLU-CORTEF Sterile Powder is 100 mg to 500 mg, depending on the specific disease entity being treated. However, in certain overwhelming, acute, life-threatening situations, administration in dosages exceeding the usual dosages may be justified and may be in multiples of the oral dosages. This dose may be repeated at intervals of 2, 4, or 6 hours as indicated by the patient's response and clinical condition. It Should Be Emphasized that Dosage Requirements Are Variable and Must Be Individualized on the Basis of the Disease Under Treatment and the Response of the Patient. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time int"

Dosage should be adjusted according to blood pressure response. The antihypertensive effect of moexipril hydrochloride tablets may diminish towards the end of the dosing interval. Blood pressure should, therefore, be measured just prior to dosing to determine whether satisfactory blood pressure control is obtained. If control is not adequate, increased dose or divided dosing can be tried. The recommended dose range is 7.5 to 30 mg daily, administered in one or two divided doses one hour before meals. Total daily doses above 60 mg a day have not been studied in hypertensive patients. In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic hypotension may occasionally occur following the initial dose of moexipril hydrochloride tablets. The diuretic should, if possible, be discontinued for 2 to 3 days before therapy with moexipril hydrochloride tablets is begun, to reduce the likelihood of hypotension (see WARNINGS ). If the patient’s blood pressure is not controlled with moexipril hydrochloride tablets alone, diuretic therapy may then be reinstituted. If diuretic therapy cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 3.75 mg of moexipril hydrochloride tablets should be used with medical supervision until blood pressure has stabilized (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ). Dosage Adjustment in Renal Impairment For patients with a creatinine clearance ≤ 40 mL/min/1.73 m2, an initial dose of 3.75 mg once daily should be given cautiously. Doses may be titrated upward to a maximum daily dose of 15 mg."

    "package_label": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION General Considerations Dosage of glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 20 mg glipizide/2000 mg metformin. Glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets should be given with meals and should be initiated at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation as described below, in order to avoid hypoglycemia (largely due to glipizide), reduce GI side effects (largely due to metformin), and permit determination of the minimum effective dose for adequate control of blood glucose for the individual patient. With initial treatment and during dose titration, appropriate blood glucose monitoring should be used to determine the therapeutic response to glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets and to identify the minimum effective dose for the patient. Thereafter, HbA1c should be measured at intervals of approximately 3 months to assess the effectiveness of therapy. The therapeutic goal in all patients with type 2 diabetes is to decrease FPG, PPG, and HbA1c to normal or as near normal as possible. Ideally, the response to therapy should be evaluated using HbA1c, which is a better indicator of long-term glycemic control than FPG alone. No studies have been performed specifically examining the safety and efficacy of switching to glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablet therapy in patients taking concomitant glipizide (or other sulfonylurea) plus metformin. Changes in glycemic control may occur in such patients, with either hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia possible. Any change in therapy of type 2 diabetes should be undertaken with care and appropriate monitoring. Glipizide and Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets in Patients With Inadequate Glycemic Control on Diet and Exercise Alone For patients with type 2 diabetes whose hyperglycemia cannot be satisfactorily managed with diet and exercise alone, the recommended starting dos"

Adults The usual starting dose for adult schizophrenic patients is 50 mg to 100 mg three times a day, with a gradual increment to a maximum of 800 mg daily if necessary. Once effective control of symptoms has been achieved, the dosage may be reduced gradually to determine the minimum maintenance dose. The total daily dosage ranges from 200 mg to 800 mg, divided into two to four doses. Pediatric Patients For pediatric patients with schizophrenia who are unresponsive to other agents, the recommended initial dose is 0.5 mg/kg/day given in divided doses. Dosage may be increased gradually until optimum therapeutic effect is obtained or the maximum dose of 3 mg/kg/day has been reached."

    "package_label": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION General The suppression of tics by pimozide tablets, USP requires a slow and gradual introduction of the drug. The patient’s dose should be carefully adjusted to a point where the suppression of tics and the relief afforded is balanced against the untoward side effects of the drug. An ECG should be done at baseline and periodically thereafter, especially during the period of dose adjustment (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS - Laboratory Tests). Periodic attempts should be made to reduce the dosage of pimozide tablets, USP to see whether or not tics persist at the level and extent first identified. In attempts to reduce the dosage of pimozide tablets, USP consideration should be given to the possibility that increases of tic intensity and frequency may represent a transient, withdrawal related phenomenon rather than a return of disease symptoms. Specifically, one to two weeks should be allowed to elapse before one concludes that an increase in tic manifestations is a function of the underlying disease syndrome rather than a response to drug withdrawal. A gradual withdrawal is recommended in any case. Children Reliable dose response data for the effects of pimozide tablets, USP on tic manifestation in Tourette’s Disorder patients below the age of twelve are not available. Treatment should be initiated at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg preferably taken once at bedtime. The dose may be increased every third day to a maximum of 0.2 mg/kg not to exceed 10 mg/day. At doses above 0.05 mg/kg/day, CYP 2D6 genotyping should be performed. In poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers, pimozide tablets, USP doses should not exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day, and doses should not be increased earlier than 14 days (see PRECAUTIONS – Pharmacogenomics). Adults In general, treatment with pimozide tablets, USP should be initiated with a dose of 1 to 2 mg a day in divided doses. The dose may be increased thereafter every other day. Most patients are maintained at less than 0.2 mg/kg/day, or 10 mg/day, "

Rheumatoid Arthritis For relief of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, the usual recommended dose is 1200 mg (two 600-mg tablets) given orally once a day (see Individualization of Dosage). Osteoarthritis For relief of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis, the usual recommended dose is 1200 mg (two 600-mg tablets) given orally once a day (see Individualization of Dosage). Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis For the relief of the signs and symptoms of JRA in patients 6-16 years of age, the recommended dose given orally once per day should be based on body weight of the patient as given in Table 3 (see also Individualization of Dosage).

Therefore, after observing the response to initial therapy with oxaprozin, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient’s needs. In osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, the dosage should be individualized to the lowest effective dose of oxaprozin to minimize adverse effects. The maximum recommended total daily dose of oxaprozin tablets in adults is 1800 mg (26 mg/kg, whichever is lower) in divided doses. In children, doses greater than 1200 mg have not been studied.

In addition to the usual monitoring of urinary glucose, the patient’s blood glucose must also be monitored periodically to determine the minimum effective dose for the patient; to detect primary failure, i.e., inadequate lowering of blood glucose at the maximum recommended dose of medication; and to detect secondary failure, i.e., loss of an adequate blood-glucose-lowering response after an initial period of effectiveness. Glycosylated hemoglobin levels may also be of value in monitoring the patient’s response to therapy. Short-term administration of glipizide may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control in patients usually controlled well on diet. In general, glipizide should be given approximately 30 minutes before a meal to achieve the greatest reduction in postprandial hyperglycemia. Initial Dose: The recommended starting dose is 5 mg, given before breakfast. Geriatric patients or those with liver disease may be started on 2.5 mg. Titration: Dosage adjustments should ordinarily be in increments of 2.5 to 5 mg, as determined by blood glucose response. At least several days should elapse between titration steps. If response to a single dose is not satisfactory, dividing that dose may prove effective. The maximum recommended once daily dose is 15 mg. Doses above 15 mg should ordinarily be divided and given before meals of adequate caloric content. The maximum recommended total daily dose is 40 mg. Maintenance: Some patients may be effectively controlled on a once-a-day regimen, while others show better response with divided dosing. Total daily doses above 15 mg should ordinarily be divided. Total daily doses above 30 mg have been safely given on a b.i.d. basis to long-term patients.

(2.12) 2.1 Important Dosage and Safety Information Use only preservative-free Methotrexate Injection for treatment of neonates or low-birth weight infants and for intrathecal use. Do not use benzyl alcohol-containing formulations for high-dose regimens unless immediate treatment is required and preservative-free formulations are not available [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential before starting Methotrexate Injection [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. For patients switching between a methotrexate product administered orally and Methotrexate Injection, consider potential differences in bioavailability. 2.2 Recommended Monitoring and Concomitant Therapies for Intermediate- and High-Dose Regimens To decrease the risk of severe adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]: Administer leucovorin rescue in patients receiving Methotrexate Injection doses of 500 mg/m2 or greater (e.g., high-dose). Consider leucovorin rescue for patients receiving Methotrexate Injection doses between 100 mg/m2 to less than 500 mg/m2 (e.g., intermediate-dose).Refer to the leucovorin Prescribing"

Succinylcholine Chloride Injection must be titrated to effect by or under supervision of experienced clinicians who are familiar with its actions and with appropriate neuromuscular monitoring techniques. Succinylcholine Chloride Injection should be administered only by those skilled in the management of artificial respiration and only when facilities are instantly available for tracheal intubation and for providing adequate ventilation of the patient, including the administration of oxygen under positive pressure and the elimination of CO2.

    "package_label": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended dose of PROVIGIL is 200 mg given once a day. For patients with narcolepsy and OSAHS, PROVIGIL should be taken as a single dose in the morning. For patients with SWSD, PROVIGIL should be taken approximately 1 hour prior to the start of their work shift. Doses up to 400 mg/day, given as a single dose, have been well tolerated, but there is no consistent evidence that this dose confers additional benefit beyond that of the 200 mg dose (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and CLINICAL TRIALS). General Considerations Dosage adjustment should be considered for concomitant medications that are substrates for CYP3A4, such as triazolam and cyclosporine (See PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). Drugs that are largely eliminated via CYP2C19 metabolism, such as diazepam, propranolol, phenytoin (also via CYP2C9) or S-mephenytoin may have prolonged elimination upon coadministration with PROVIGIL and may require dosage reduction and monitoring for toxicity. In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the dose of PROVIGIL should be reduced to one-half of that recommended for patients with normal hepatic function (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and PRECAUTIONS). There is inadequate information to determine safety and efficacy of dosing in patients with severe renal impairment (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and PRECAUTIONS). In elderly patients, elimination of PROVIGIL and its metabolites may be reduced as a consequence of aging. Therefore, consideration should be given to the use of lower doses in this population (SeeCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and PRECAUTIONS)."

    "package_label": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The usual oral dosage is 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg body weight daily for 3 to 6 weeks as required. This usually amounts to 4 to 10 mg per day for the average patient. The entire daily dose may be given at one time. These dosages are for initiation of therapy or for short courses of treatment. The dosage must be carefully adjusted according to the response of the patient and must be reduced as soon as there is an abrupt fall in the white blood cell count. Patients with Hodgkin’s disease usually require 0.2 mg/kg daily, whereas patients with other lymphomas or chronic lymphocytic leukemia usually require only 0.1 mg/kg daily. When lymphocytic infiltration of the bone marrow is present, or when the bone marrow is hypoplastic, the daily dose should not exceed 0.1 mg/kg (about 6 mg for the average patient). Alternate schedules for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia employing intermittent, biweekly, or once-monthly pulse doses of chlorambucil have been reported. Intermittent schedules of chlorambucil begin with an initial single dose of 0.4 mg/kg. Doses are generally increased by 0.1 mg/kg until control of lymphocytosis or toxicity is observed. Subsequent doses are modified to produce mild hematologic toxicity. It is felt that the response rate of chronic lymphocytic leukemia to the biweekly or once-monthly schedule of chlorambucil administration is similar or better to that previously reported with daily administration and that hematologic toxicity was less than or equal to that encountered in studies using daily chlorambucil. Radiation and cytotoxic drugs render the bone marrow more vulnerable to damage, and chlorambucil should be used with particular caution within 4 weeks of a full course of radiation therapy or chemotherapy. However, small doses of palliative radiation over isolated foci remote from the bone marrow will not usually depress the neutrophil and platelet count. In these cases chlorambucil may be given in the customary dosage. "

Closely monitor glucoses especially upon converting to LEVEMIR and during the initial weeks thereafter (2.3) 2.1 Dosing LEVEMIR is a recombinant human insulin analog for once- or twice-daily subcutaneous administration. Patients treated with LEVEMIR once-daily should administer the dose with the evening meal or at bedtime. Patients who require twice-daily dosing can administer the evening dose with the evening meal, at bedtime, or 12 hours after the morning dose. The dose of LEVEMIR must be individualized based on clinical response. Blood glucose monitoring is essential in all patients receiving insulin therapy. Patients adjusting the amount or timing of dosing with LEVEMIR should only do so under medical supervision with appropriate glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . In patients with type 1 diabetes, LEVEMIR must be used in a regimen with rapid-acting or short-acting insulin. As with all insulins, injection sites should be rotated within the same region (abdomen, thigh, or deltoid) from one injection to the next to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . LEVEMIR can be injected subcutaneously in the thigh, abdominal wall, or upper arm. As with all insulins, the rate of absorption, and consequently the onset and duration of action, may be affected by exercise and other variables, such as stress, intercurrent illness, or changes in co-administered medications or meal patterns. 2.2 Initiation of LEVEMIR Th"

The dose should be increased as rapidly as possible to achieve the lowest therapeutic dose which produces the desired clinical effect or the desired range of plasma concentrations. In placebo-controlled clinical trials of acute mania, patients were dosed to a clinical response with a trough plasma concentration between 50 and 125 mcg/mL. Maximum concentrations were generally achieved within 14 days. The maximum recommended dosage is 60 mg/kg/day.There is no body of evidence available from controlled trials to guide a clinician in the longer term management of a patient who improves during divalproex sodium treatment of an acute manic episode. While it is generally agreed that pharmacological treatment beyond an acute response in mania is desirable, both for maintenance of the initial response and for prevention of new manic episodes, there are no systematically obtained data to support the benefits of divalproex sodium in such longer-term treatment. Although there are no efficacy data that specifically address longer-term antimanic treatment with divalproex sodium, the safety of divalproex sodium in long-term use is supported by data from record reviews involving approximately 360 patients treated with divalproex sodium for greater than 3 months. Epilepsy Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets are administered orally. Divalproex sodium is indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in complex partial seizures in adults and pediatric patients down to the age of 10 years, and in simple and complex absence seizures. As the divalproex sodium dosage is titrated upward, concentrations of phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and/or phenytoin may be affected (see PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions). Complex Partial Seizures For adults and children 10 years of age or older. Monotherapy (Initial Therapy) Divalproex sodi"

A total daily dose greater than 40 mcg is not recommended. Formoterol fumarate inhalation solution should be administered by the orally inhaled route via a standard jet nebulizer connected to an air compressor. The safety and efficacy of formoterol fumarate inhalation solution have been established in clinical trials when administered using the PARI-LC Plus® nebulizer (with a facemask or mouthpiece) and the PRONEB® Ultra compressor. The safety and efficacy of formoterol fumarate inhalation solution delivered from non-compressor based nebulizer systems have not been established. Formoterol fumarate inhalation solution should always be stored in the foil pouch, and only removed IMMEDIATELY BEFORE USE. Contents of any partially used container should be discarded. If the recommended maintenance treatment regimen fails to provide the usual response, medical advice should be sought immediately, as this is often a sign of destabilization of COPD. Under these circumstances, the therapeutic regimen should be re-evaluated and additional therapeutic options should be considered. The drug compatibility (physical and chemical), efficacy, and safety of formoterol fumarate inhalation solution when mixed with other drugs in a nebulizer have not been established. For oral inhalation only. One 20 mcg/2 mL vial every 12 hours (2) For use with a standard jet nebulizer (with a facemask or mouthpiece) connected to an air compressor (2)"

In patients with severe hepatic dysfunction, severe renal impairment (CrCl 5 to 29 mL/min) or renal failure (CrCl ≤ 10 mL/min) and in elderly nursing home patients, a dose reduction to 100 mg daily is recommended. Because of the potential for accumulation of rimantadine metabolites during multiple dosing, patients with hepatic or renal impairment should be monitored for adverse effects. Children (1 year to 16 years of age) Study duration ranged from 5 weeks to 6 weeks in pediatric subjects. In children 1 year to 9 years of age, rimantadine hydrochloride should be administered once a day, at a dose of 5 mg/kg but not exceeding 150 mg. For children 10 years of age or older, use the adult dose. (see Directions for Compounding of an Oral Suspension from Rimantadine Hydrochloride Tablets to prepare an oral suspension for administration to children and patients with difficulty swallowing tablets). Children (Birth to 11 months) The safety and efficacy of rimantadine hydrochloride for prophylaxis of influenza in pediatric patients younger than 1 year of age have not been established.

Occurrence of drowsiness may require the administration of a major portion of the daily dose at bedtime or a reduction of dosage. Trazodone HCl should be taken shortly after a meal or light snack. Symptomatic relief may be seen during the first week with optimal antidepressant effects typically evident within two weeks. Twenty-five percent of those who respond to trazodone HCl require more than two weeks (up to four weeks) of drug administration. Usual Adult Dosage: An initial dose of 150 mg/day in divided doses is suggested. The dose may be increased by 50 mg/day every three to four days. The maximum dose for outpatients usually should not exceed 400 mg/day in divided doses. Inpatients (i.e., more severely depressed patients) may be given up to but not in excess of 600 mg/day in divided doses. Maintenance: Dosage during prolonged maintenance therapy should be kept at the lowest effective level. Once an adequate response has been achieved, dosage may be gradually reduced, with subsequent adjustment depending on therapeutic response. Although there has been no systematic evaluation of the efficacy of trazodone beyond 6 weeks, it is generally recommended that a course of antidepressant drug treatment should be continued for several months."

In patients with OSA, doses up to 250 mg/day, given as a single dose, have been well tolerated, but there is no consistent evidence that this dose confers additional benefit beyond that of the 150 mg/day dose (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and CLINICAL TRIALS ). Shift Work Sleep Disorder (SWD) The recommended dose of NUVIGIL for patients with SWD is 150 mg given daily approximately 1 hour prior to the start of their work shift. Dosage adjustment should be considered for concomitant medications that are substrates for CYP3A4/5, such as steroidal contraceptives, triazolam, and cyclosporine (See PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ). Drugs that are largely eliminated via CYP2C19 metabolism, such as diazepam, propranolol, and phenytoin may have prolonged elimination upon coadministration with NUVIGIL and may require dosage reduction and monitoring for toxicity (See PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ). In patients with severe hepatic impairment, NUVIGIL should be administered at a reduced dose (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and PRECAUTIONS ). There is inadequate information to determine safety and efficacy of dosing in patients with severe renal impairment (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and PRECAUTIONS ). In elderly patients, elimination of armodafinil and its metabolites may be reduced as a consequence of aging. Therefore, consideration should be given to the use of lower doses in this population (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and PRECAUTIONS )."

In order to minimize patient exposure to the plasticizer DEHP [di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate], which may be leached from PVC infusion bags or sets, diluted paclitaxel solutions should be stored in bottles (glass, polypropylene) or plastic bags (polypropylene, polyolefin) and administered through polyethylene-lined administration sets. All patients should be premedicated prior to paclitaxel administration in order to prevent severe hypersensitivity reactions. Such premedication may consist of dexamethasone 20 mg PO administered approximately 12 and 6 hours before paclitaxel, diphenhydramine (or its equivalent) 50 mg I.V. 30 to 60 minutes prior to paclitaxel, and cimetidine (300 mg) or ranitidine (50 mg) I.V. 30 to 60 minutes before paclitaxel. For patients with carcinoma of the ovary the following regimen is recommended: (see CLINICAL STUDIES: Ovarian Carcinoma ): 1) For previously untreated patients with carcinoma of the ovary, one of the following recommended regimens may be given every 3 weeks. In selecting the appropriate regimen, differences in toxicities should be considered (see Table 11 in ADVERSE REACTIONS: Disease-Specific Adverse Event Experiences ). Paclitaxel administered intravenously over 3 hours at a dose of 175 mg/m2 followed by cisplatin at a dose of 75 mg/m2; or Paclitaxel administered intravenously over 24 hours at a dose of 135 mg/m2 followed by cisplatin at a dose of 75 mg/m2. 2) In patients previously treated with chemotherapy for carcinoma of the ovary, paclitaxel has been used at several doses and schedules; however, the optimal regimen is not yet clear. (See CLINICAL STUDIES: Ovarian Carcinoma section). The recommended regimen is paclitaxel 135 mg/m2 or 175 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 3 hours every 3 weeks.

(2.2) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended dosage of LEQVIO is 284 mg administered as a single subcutaneous injection initially, again at 3 months, and then every 6 months. If a planned dose is missed by less than 3 months, administer LEQVIO and maintain dosing according to the patient’s original schedule. If a planned dose is missed by more than 3 months, restart with a new dosing schedule - administer LEQVIO initially, again at 3 months, and then every 6 months. Assess LDL-C when clinically indicated. The LDL-lowering effect of LEQVIO may be measured as early as 30 days after initiation and anytime thereafter without regard to timing of the dose. 2.2 Important Administration Instructions LEQVIO should be administered by a healthcare professional. Inject LEQVIO subcutaneously into the abdomen, upper arm, or thigh. Do not inject in areas of active skin disease or injury, such as sunburns, skin rashes, inflammation, or skin infections. Inspect LEQVIO visually before use. It should appear clear and colorless to pale yellow. Do not use if particulate matter or discoloration is seen.

There is no evidence that additional benefit will be obtained from the administration of higher doses. Moreover, higher doses should ordinarily be avoided because of the increased risk of side effects. After two to three days of selegiline treatment, an attempt may be made to reduce the dose of levodopa/carbidopa. A reduction of 10 to 30% was achieved with the typical participant in the domestic placebo controlled trials who was assigned to selegiline treatment. Further reductions of levodopa/carbidopa may be possible during continued selegiline therapy."

(2.4) • Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: ABRAXANE is not recommended for use in patients with AST > 10 × ULN; or bilirubin > 5 × ULN or with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who have moderate to severe hepatic impairment. For MBC or NSCLC, reduce starting dose in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. (2.5) • Dose Reductions for Adverse Reactions: Dose reductions or discontinuation may be needed based on severe hematologic, neurologic, cutaneous, or gastrointestinal toxicities. (2.6) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions DO NOT SUBSTITUTE FOR OR WITH OTHER PACLITAXEL FORMULATIONS. ABRAXANE has different dosage and administration instructions from other paclitaxel products. Closely monitor the infusion site for extravasation or drug infiltration during administration. Limiting the infusion of ABRAXANE to 30 minutes may reduce the risk of infusion-related reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Consider premedication in patients who have had prior hypersensitivity reactions to ABRAXANE. Do not re-challenge patients who experience a severe hypersensitivity reaction to ABRAXANE [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. 2.2"

The recommended initial total daily dose of lanthanum carbonate chewable tablets is 1,500 mg. Titrate the dose every 2 to 3 weeks until an acceptable serum phosphate level is reached. Monitor serum phosphate levels as needed during dose titration and on a regular basis thereafter. Lanthanum carbonate chewable tablets has the potential to bind other orally administered drugs; consider separating the administration of other oral medications [see Drug Interactions (7)]. In clinical studies of patients with ESRD, lanthanum carbonate chewable tablets doses up to 4,500 mg were evaluated. Most patients required a total daily dose between 1,500 mg and 3,000 mg to reduce plasma phosphate levels to less than 6.0 mg/dL. Doses were generally titrated in increments of 750 mg/day. Chew or crush lanthanum carbonate chewable tablets completely before swallowing. Do not swallow intact lanthanum carbonate chewable tablets. Consider using the oral powder formulation in patients with poor dentition or who have difficulty chewing tablets. The recommended initial total daily dose of lanthanum carbonate chewable tablets is 1,500 mg in divided doses. Titrate every 2 to 3 weeks based on serum phosphate level. (2) Take lanthanum carbonate chewable tablets with or immediately after meals. (2) Chew or crush tablet completely before swallowing. (2)"

After two weeks, the dosage may be increased to 100 mg once daily, based on individual need and tolerability. Daily dosages of XADAGO above 100 mg have not been shown to provide additional benefit, and higher dosages increase the risk for adverse reactions. XADAGO has been shown to be effective only in combination with levodopa/carbidopa [see Indications and Usage (1)] . If a dose is missed, the next dose should be taken at the same time the next day. XADAGO 100 mg should be tapered by decreasing the dose to 50 mg for one week before stopping [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] . 2.2 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B: 7-9), the maximum recommended dosage of XADAGO is 50 mg orally once daily. XADAGO is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C: 10-15) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . If a patient taking 50 mg XADAGO progresses from moderate to severe hepatic impairment, discontinue XADAGO."

Monitor patient oxygen saturation with pulse oximetry. (2.1) Recommended Dosage Regimen: (2.2) Days 1 to 3 administer TERLIVAZ 0.85 mg (1 vial) intravenously every 6 hours. Day 4: Assess serum creatinine (SCr) versus baseline. If SCr has decreased by at least 30% from baseline, continue TERLIVAZ 0.85 mg (1 vial) intravenously every 6 hours. If SCr has decreased by less than 30% from baseline, dose may be increased to TERLIVAZ 1.7 mg (2 vials) intravenously every 6 hours. If SCr is at or above baseline value, discontinue TERLIVAZ. Continue TERLIVAZ until 24 hours after two consecutive SCr ≤1.5 mg/dL values at least 2 hours apart or a maximum of 14 days. See full prescribing information for instructions on preparation and administration (2.3). Flush IV line after administration. 2.1 Important Considerations Prior to Initiating and During Therapy Obtain baseline oxygen saturation (SpO2) prior to administering the first dose of TERLIVAZ. During treatment, monitor patient oxygen saturation using continuous pulse oximetry. Do not use TERLIVAZ treatment in patients experiencing hypoxia until hypoxia resolves [see Contraindications (4), and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Assess Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) Grade and volume status before initiating TERLIVAZ [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and References (15)]. 2.2 Recommended Dosage Record last available serum creatinine (SCr) value prior to initiating treatment (baseline SCr). The recommended starting dosage is TERLIVAZ 0.85 mg every 6 hours by slow intravenous bolus injection (over 2 minutes) on Days 1 through 3. Adjust the dose on Day 4 based on changes from baseline SCr using the dosing chart (Figure 1). Figure 1: Dosing Chart a Baseline SCr is the last available serum creatinine before initiating treatment. Figure 1 2.3 Preparation and Administration Reconstitute each vial w"

    "package_label": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hypertension Adults The recommended initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets is 10 mg once a day, both as monotherapy and when the drug is added to a diuretic. Dosage should then be adjusted according to blood pressure response at peak (2 to 6 hours) and trough (about 24 hours after dosing) blood levels. The usual dosage range needed to maintain a response at trough is 20 to 40 mg but some patients appear to have a further response to 80 mg. In some patients treated with once daily dosing, the antihypertensive effect may diminish toward the end of the dosing interval. If trough response is inadequate, dividing the daily dose should be considered. If blood pressure is not adequately controlled with fosinopril sodium alone, a diuretic may be added. Concomitant administration of fosinopril sodium with potassium supplements, potassium salt substitutes, or potassium-sparing diuretics can lead to increases of serum potassium (see PRECAUTIONS ). In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic hypotension occasionally can occur following the initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets. To reduce the likelihood of hypotension, the diuretic should, if possible, be discontinued two to three days prior to beginning therapy with fosinopril sodium tablets (see WARNINGS ). Then, if blood pressure is not controlled with fosinopril sodium tablets alone diuretic therapy should be resumed. If diuretic therapy cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 10 mg of fosinopril sodium tablets should be used with careful medical supervision for several hours and until blood pressure has stabilized. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and Drug Interactions ). Since concomitant administration of fosinopril sodium tablets with potassium supplements, or potassium containing salt substitutes or potassium-sparing diuretics may lead to increases in serum potassium, they should be used with caution (see PRECAUTIONS ).

Starting dosage is based on asthma severity. (2.2) •Treatment of asthma in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years: 2 inhalations of BREYNA 80 mcg/4.5 mcg twice daily. (2.2) •Maintenance treatment in COPD: 2 inhalations of BREYNA 160 mcg/4.5 mcg twice daily. (2.3) 2.1 Administration Information BREYNA should be administered as 2 inhalations twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart), every day by the orally inhaled route only. After inhalation, the patient should rinse the mouth with water without swallowing. Prime BREYNA before using for the first time by releasing two test sprays into the air away from the face, shaking well for 5 seconds before each spray. In cases where the inhaler has not been used for more than 7 days or when it has been dropped, prime the inhaler again by shaking well before each spray and releasing two test sprays into the air away from the face. More frequent administration or a higher number of inhalations (more than 2 inhalations twice daily) of the prescribed strength of BREYNA is not recommended as some patients are more likely to experience adverse effects with higher doses of formoterol. Patients using BREYNA should not use additional LABA for any reason [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.12) ]. 2.2 Asthma If asthma symptoms arise in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist should be taken for immediate relief. Adult and Adolescent Patients 12 Years of Age and Older For patients 12 years of age and older, the dosage is 2 inhalations of BREYNA 80 mcg/4.5 mcg or BREYNA 160 mcg/4.5 mcg twice daily. The recommended starting dosages for BREYNA for patients 12 years of age and older are based upon patients’ asthma severity or level of control of asthma symptoms, and risk of exacerbations on current inhaled corticosteroi"

Once toxicities have resolved to grade 2 or less, temsirolimus injection may be restarted with the dose reduced by 5 mg/week to a dose no lower than 15 mg/week. 2.4 Dose Modification Guidelines Hepatic Impairment: Use caution when treating patients with hepatic impairment. If temsirolimus injection must be given in patients with mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin >1 – 1.5xULN or AST >ULN but bilirubin ≤ULN), reduce the dose of temsirolimus injection to 15 mg/week. Temsirolimus injection is contraindicated in patients with bilirubin >1.5xULN [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

The initial dose for patients 3 to 6 years of age is one capsule (250 mg) per day; for patients 6 years of age and older, 2 capsules (500 mg) per day. The dose thereafter must be individualized according to the patient's response. Dosage should be increased by small increments. One useful method is to increase the daily dose by 250 mg every four to seven days until control is achieved with minimal side effects. Dosages exceeding 1.5 g daily, in divided doses, should be administered only under the strictest supervision of the physician. The optimal dose for most pediatric patients is 20 mg/kg/day. This dose has given average plasma levels within the accepted therapeutic range of 40 to 100 mcg/mL. Subsequent dose schedules can be based on effectiveness and plasma level determinations. Ethosuximide may be administered in combination with other anticonvulsants when other forms of epilepsy coexist with absence (petit mal). The optimal dose for most pediatric patients is 20 mg/kg/day."

    "package_label": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended usual dosage range of trandolapril for hypertension is 1 to 4 mg per day administered in a single dose or two divided doses. The recommended usual dosage range of Isoptin-SR for hypertension is 120 to 480 mg per day administered in a single dose or two divided doses. The hazards (see WARNINGS) of trandolapril are generally independent of dose; those of verapamil are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily dizziness, AV block, constipation) and dose-independent phenomena, the former much more common than the latter. Therapy with any combination of trandolapril and verapamil will thus be associated with both sets of dose-independent hazards. The dose-dependent side effects of verapamil have not been shown to be decreased by the addition of trandolapril nor vice versa. Rarely, the dose-independent hazards of trandolapril are serious. To minimize dose-independent hazards, it is usually appropriate to begin therapy with TARKA only after a patient has either (a) failed to achieve the desired antihypertensive effect with one or the other monotherapy at its respective maximally recommended dose and shortest dosing interval, or (b) the dose of one or the other monotherapy cannot be increased further because of dose-limiting side effects. Clinical trials with TARKA have explored only once-a-day doses. The antihypertensive effect and or adverse effects of adding 4 mg of trandolapril once-a-day to a dose of 240 mg Isoptin-SR administered twice-a-day has not been studied, nor have the effects of adding as little of 180 mg Isoptin-SR to 2 mg trandolapril administered twice-a-day been evaluated. Over the dose range of Isoptin-SR 120 to 240 mg once-a-day and trandolapril 0.5 to 8 mg once-a-day, the effects of the combination increase with increasing doses of either component. Replacement Therapy For convenience, patients receiving trandolapril (up to 8 mg) and verapamil (up to 240 mg) in separate tablets, administered once-a-day, m"

The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) should be maintained between 50 and 70 seconds unless PCI is to be performed.

If full control is not achieved within the range of 50 to 300 mg daily, higher doses may be tried. Dosage should be reduced to a minimum maintenance level as soon as possible. In responsive patients there is a prompt reduction in pruritus followed by clearance of skin lesions. There is no effect on the gastrointestinal component of the disease. Dapsone levels are influenced by acetylation rates. Patients with high acetylation rates, or who are receiving treatment affecting acetylation may require an adjustment in dosage. A strict gluten free diet is an option for the patient to elect, permitting many to reduce or eliminate the need for Dapsone; the average time for dosage reduction is 8 months with a range of 4 months to 2 1/2 years and for dosage elimination 29 months with a range of 6 months to 9 years. Lepros y: In order to reduce secondary Dapsone resistance, the WHO Expert Committee on Leprosy and the USPHS at Carville, LA, recommended that Dapsone should be commenced in combination with one or more anti-leprosy drugs. In the multidrug program Dapsone should be maintained at the full dosage of 100 mg daily without interruption (with corresponding smaller doses for children) and provided to all patients who have sensitive organisms with new or recrudescent disease or who have not yet completed a two year course of Dapsone monotherapy. For advice and other drugs, the USPHS at Carville, LA (1-800-642-2477) should be contacted. Before using other drugs consult appropriate product labeling. In bacteriologically negative tuberculoid and indeterminate disease, the recommendation is the coadministration of Dapsone 100 mg daily with six months of Rifampin 600 mg daily. Under WHO, daily Rifampin may be replaced by 600 mg Rifampin monthly, if supervised. The Dapsone is continued until all signs o"

Patients must be appropriately hydrated prior to administration of zoledronic acid injection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Intravenous infusion should be followed by a 10 mL normal saline flush of the intravenous line. Administration of acetaminophen following zoledronic acid injection administration may reduce the incidence of acute-phase reaction symptoms. 2.6 Treatment of Paget’s Disease of Bone The recommended dose is a 5 mg infusion. The infusion time must not be less than 15 minutes given over a constant infusion rate. Re-treatment of Paget?s Disease After a single treatment with zoledronic acid injection in Paget’s disease an extended remission period is observed. Specific re-treatment data are not available. However, re-treatment with zoledronic acid injection may be considered in patients who have relapsed, based on increases in serum alkaline phosphatase, or in those patients who failed to achieve normalization of their serum alkaline phosphatase, or in those patients with symptoms, as dictated by medical practice. 2.7 Laboratory Testing and Oral Examination Prior to Administration Prior to administration of each dose of zoledronic acid injection, obtain a serum creatinine and creatinine clearance should be calculated based on actual body weight using Cockcroft-Gault formula before each zoledronic acid injection dose.

Do not remove container cap during use of the product. Hold container upright on a level surface and gently place the tip of the applicator onto the nose of the container cap. CONTAINER MUST BE HELD UPRIGHT TO OBTAIN PROPER FLOW OF MEDICATION. Pull plunger past the fill line on the applicator barrel.Hold the container and applicator at eye level. Place the index and middle fingers on the container cap flanges and the thumb beneath the container. Support the applicator with your other hand. Prime the container by pressing down firmly on flanges and then release. With initial priming, a burst of air may come out of the container. It usually requires 1-2 pumps for foam to appear. To fill applicator barrel, press down firmly on cap flanges, hold for 1-2 seconds, and release. Wait 5-10 seconds to allow foam to expand in applicator barrel. Repeat until foam reaches fill line. It usually requires 3-4 pumps for foam to reach fill line. Remove applicator from container cap. Note: If foam goes beyond fill line, it will continue to expand and flow backwards resulting in foam build-up under cap. Hold applicator firmly by barrel, making sure thumb and middle finger are positioned securely underneath and resting against barrel wings. Place index finger over the plunger. Gently insert tip into anus. Once in place, push plunger to expel foam, then withdraw applicator. CAUTION: Do not insert any part of the aerosol container directly into the anus.

    "package_label": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Depression Lower dosages are recommended for elderly patients and adolescents. Lower dosages are also recommended for outpatients as compared to hospitalized patients who will be under close supervision. Dosage should be initiated at a low level and increased gradually, noting carefully the clinical response and any evidence of intolerance. Following remission, maintenance medication may be required for a longer period of time, at the lowest dose that will maintain remission. Usual Adult Dose Hospitalized Patients – Initially, 100 mg/day in divided doses gradually increased to 200 mg/day as required. If no response after two weeks, increase to 250 to 300 mg/day. Outpatients – Initially, 75 mg/day increased to 150 mg/day. Dosages over 200 mg/day are not recommended. Maintenance, 50 to 150 mg/day. Adolescent and Geriatric Patients – Initially, 30 to 40 mg/day; it is generally not necessary to exceed 100 mg/day. Childhood Enuresis Initially, an oral dose of 25 mg/day should be tried in children aged 6 and older. Medication should be given one hour before bedtime. If a satisfactory response does not occur within one week, increase the dose to 50 mg nightly in children under 12 years; children over 12 may receive up to 75 mg nightly. A daily dose greater than 75 mg does not enhance efficacy and tends to increase side effects. Evidence suggests that in early night bedwetters, the drug is more effective given earlier and in divided amounts, i.e., 25 mg in midafternoon, repeated at bedtime. Consideration should be given to instituting a drug free period following an adequate therapeutic trial with a favorable response. Dosage should be tapered off gradually rather than abruptly discontinued; this may reduce the tendency to relapse. Children who relapse when the drug is discontinued do not always respond to a subsequent course of treatment. A dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day should not be exceeded. ECG changes of unknown significance have been reported in pedi"

This should give a rough guide with respect to the responsiveness of ventricular rate. After the 4 minutes of initial maintenance infusion (total treatment duration being 5 minutes), depending upon the desired ventricular response, the maintenance infusion may be continued at 0.05 mg/kg/min or increased step-wise (e.g. 0.1 mg/kg/min, 0.15 mg/kg/min to a maximum of 0.2 mg/kg/min) with each step being maintained for 4 or more minutes. If more rapid slowing of ventricular response is imperative, the 0.5 mg/kg loading dose infused over a 1 minute period may be repeated, followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.1 mg/kg/min for 4 minutes. Then, depending upon ventricular rate, another (and final) loading dose of 0.5 mg/kg/min infused over a 1 minute period may be administered followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.15 mg/kg/min. If needed, after 4 minutes of the 0.15 mg/kg/min maintenance infusion, the maintenance infusion may be increased to a maximum of 0.2 mg/kg/min. In the absence of loading doses, constant infusion of a single concentration of esmolol reaches pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic steady-state in about 30 minutes. Maintenance infusions (with or without loading doses) may be continued for as long as 24 hours. The following table summarizes the above and assumes that 3 loading doses (the maximum recommended) are infused over 1 minute and incremental maintenance doses are required after each loading dose. There should be no 4th loading dose, but the maintenance dose may be incremented one more time. Elapsed Time Loading dose (over 1 minute) Maintenance Dose (over 4 minutes) (minutes) Micrograms/kg/min Mill"

Adults-Oral The only oral dose clearly shown to be effective is 160 mg per day (in 4 equally divided doses). Since this dose is associated with a significant incidence of side effects, it is prudent to begin with 80 mg per day (in 4 equally divided doses). Depending upon the patient's response during the first week of therapy, the dose should be increased to 160 mg per day unless side effects limit dosage escalation. If efficacy is not achieved within 2 weeks or side effects require doses below 80 mg per day, the drug should be discontinued. Documented safety data are not available for doses above 80 mg daily for periods longer than 2 weeks."

The patient should lie with the affected ear upward and then the drops should be instilled. This position should be maintained for 30-60 seconds to facilitate penetration of the drops into the ear.

Leucovorin calcium for injection is administered at 20 mg/m2 by intravenous injection followed by 5-fluorouracil at 425 mg/m2 by intravenous injection. 5-Fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium for injection should be administered separately to avoid the formation of a precipitate. Treatment is repeated daily for five days. This five-day treatment course may be repeated at 4 week (28-day) intervals, for 2 courses and then repeated at 4 to 5 week (28 to 35 day) intervals provided that the patient has completely recovered from the toxic effects of the prior treatment course. In subsequent treatment courses, the dosage of 5-fluorouracil should be adjusted based on patient tolerance of the prior treatment course. The daily dosage of 5-fluorouracil should be reduced by 20% for patients who experienced moderate hematologic or gastrointestinal toxicity in the prior treatment course, and by 30% for patients who experienced severe toxicity (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests ). For patients who experienced no toxicity in the prior treatment course, 5-fluorouracil dosages may be increased by 10%. Leucovorin calcium for injection dosages are not adjusted for toxicity. Leucovorin Rescue After High-Dose Methotrexate Therapy The recommendations for leucovorin rescue are based on a methotrexate dose of 12 to 15 grams/m2 administered by intravenous infusion over 4 hours (see methotrexate package insert for full prescribing information). Leucovorin rescue at a dose of 15 mg (approximately 10 mg/m2) every 6 hours for 10 doses starts 24 hours after the beginning of the methotrexate infusion. In the presence of gastrointestinal toxicity, nausea or vomiting, leucovorin calcium for injection should be adm"

Only a vaporizer specifically designed and designated for use with desflurane should be utilized for its administration. Facilities for maintenance of a patent airway, artificial ventilation, oxygen enrichment, and circulatory resuscitation must be immediately available. SUPRANE is administered by inhalation. The administration of general anesthesia must be individualized based on the patient’s response. Hypotension and respiratory depression increase as anesthesia with SUPRANE is deepened. The minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of SUPRANE decreases with increasing patient age. The MAC for SUPRANE is also reduced by concomitant N2O administration (see Table 1). The dose should be adjusted accordingly. The following table provides mean relative potency based upon age and effect of N2O in predominately ASA physical status I or II patients. Benzodiazepines and opioids decrease the MAC of SUPRANE [See Drug Interactions (7.1, Table 3)]. SUPRANE also decreases the doses of neuromuscular blocking agents required [See Drug Interactions (7.2, Table 4)]. The dose should be adjusted accordingly. 2.1 Preanesthetic Medication Issues such as whether or not to premedicate and the choice of premedication(s) must be individualized. In clinical studies, patients scheduled to be anesthetized with SUPRANE frequently received IV preanesthetic medication, such as opioid and/or benzodiazepine. 2.2 Induction In adults, some premedicated with opioid, a frequent starting concentration was 3% SUPRANE, increased in 0.5-1.0% increments every 2 to 3 breaths. End-tidal concentrations of 4-11%, SUPRANE with and without N2O, produced anesthesia within 2 to 4 minutes. When SUPRANE was tested as the primary anesthetic induction agent, the incidence of upper airway irritation (apnea, breathholding, laryngospasm, coughing and secretions) was high. During induction in adults, the ov"

Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.1 mg per day at weekly intervals. Maximum recommended dosage is 0.4 mg once daily at bedtime. (2.1) Do not substitute ONYDA XR for other clonidine products on a mg-per-mg basis because of differing pharmacokinetic profiles. (2.3) When discontinuing, taper the dose in decrements of no more than 0.1 mg every 3 to 7 days to avoid rebound hypertension. (2.4) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The starting dosage of ONYDA XR is 0.1 mg orally once daily at bedtime with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Titrate the dose of ONYDA XR in increments of 0.1 mg per day at weekly intervals depending on clinical response up to the maximum recommended dosage of 0.4 mg once daily at bedtime. Doses of ONYDA XR higher than 0.4 mg once daily were not evaluated in clinical trials for ADHD and are not recommended. When ONYDA XR is added to a CNS stimulant, adjust the dose of the CNS stimulant depending on the clinical response to ONYDA XR. 2.2 Administration Instructions Instruct patients to read the “Instructions for Use” for complete administration instructions. Use the oral dosing dispenser and bottle adapter provided with ONYDA XR. Ensure that the bottle adapter is firmly inserted into the bottle before first use and keep the adapter in place for the duration of the usage of the bottle. Gently shake ONYDA XR with a smooth up and down motion (to avoid foaming) for at least 10 seconds before each administration. For the bottles of 30 mL and 60 mL, discard any unused ONYDA XR 30 days after first opening the bottle. For the 120 mL bottle, discard any unused ONYDA XR 60 days after first opening the bottle. 2.3 Switching from Other Clonidine Products For patients switching from another clonidine product, discontinue that treatment, and titrate with ONYDA XR using the titration schedule [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]"

Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Initial Dose : 1 mg at bedtime is the starting dose for all patients, and this dose should not be exceeded as an initial dose. Patients should be closely followed during initial administration in order to minimize the risk of severe hypotensive response. Subsequent Doses: The dose should be increased in a stepwise fashion to 2 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg once daily to achieve the desired improvement of symptoms and/or flow rates. Doses of 10 mg once daily are generally required for the clinical response. Therefore, treatment with 10 mg for a minimum of 4-6 weeks may be required to assess whether a beneficial response has been achieved. Some patients may not achieve a clinical response despite appropriate titration. Although some additional patients responded at a 20 mg daily dose, there was an insufficient number of patients studied to draw definitive conclusions about this dose. There are insufficient data to support the use of higher doses for those patients who show inadequate or no response to 20 mg daily. If terazosin administration is discontinued for several days or longer, therapy should be reinstituted using the initial dosing regimen. Use with Other Drugs: Caution should be observed when Terazosin Capsules are administered concomitantly with other antihypertensive agents, especially the calcium channel blocker verapamil, to avoid the possibility of developing significant hypotension. When using Terazosin Capsules and other antihypertensive agents concomitantly, dosage reduction and retitration of either agent may be necessary (see Precautions). Hypotension has been reported when Terazosin Capsules have been used with phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors. Hypertension The dose of Terazosin Capsules and the dose interval (12 or 24 hours) should be adjusted according to the pati"

Children: It is recommended that intramuscular injections be given preferably in the mid-lateral muscles of the thigh. In infants and small children the periphery of the upper outer quadrant of the gluteal region should be used only when necessary, such as in burn patients, in order to minimize the possibility of damage to the sciatic nerve. The deltoid area should be used only if well developed, such as in certain adults and older children, and then only with caution to avoid radial nerve injury. Intramuscular injections should not be made into the lower and mid-third of the upper arm. As with all intramuscular injections, aspiration is necessary to help avoid inadvertent injection into a blood vessel. Injection sites should be alternated. As higher doses or more prolonged therapy with streptomycin may be indicated for more severe or fulminating infections (endocarditis, meningitis, etc.), the physician should always take adequate measures to be immediately aware of any toxic signs or symptoms occurring in the patient as a result of streptomycin therapy. 1. TUBERCULOSIS: The standard regimen for the treatment of drug susceptible tuberculosis has been two months of INH, rifampin and pyrazinamide followed by four months of INH and rifampin (patients with concomitant infection with tuberculosis and HIV may require treatment for a longer period). When streptomycin is added to this regimen because of suspected or proven drug resistance (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE section), the recommended dosing for streptomycin is as follows: Daily Twice Weekly Thrice Weekly Children 20-40 mg/kg Max 1 g 25-30 mg/kg Max 1.5 g 25-30 mg/kg Max 1.5 g Adults 15 mg/kg Max 1 g 25-30 mg/kg Max 1.5 g 25-30 mg/kg Max 1.5 g Streptomycin is usually administered daily as a single intramuscular injection.

The most rapid onset of action is achieved by intravenous administration and it is recommended in emergency situations. Since the duration of action of some opioids may exceed that of naloxone, the patient should be kept under continued surveillance. Repeated doses of naloxone should be administered, as necessary. Intravenous Infusion: Naloxone Hydrochloride Injection, USP may be diluted for intravenous infusion in 0.9% sodium chloride injection or 5% dextrose injection. The addition of 2 mg of naloxone hydrochloride in 500 mL of either solution provides a concentration of 0.004 mg/mL. Mixtures should be used within 24 hours. After 24 hours, the remaining unused solution must be discarded. The rate of administration should be titrated in accordance with the patient’s response. Naloxone Hydrochloride Injection, USP should not be mixed with preparations containing bisulfite, metabisulfite, long-chain or high molecular weight anions, or any solution having an alkaline pH. No drug or chemical agent should be added to Naloxone Hydrochloride Injection, USP unless its effect on the chemical and physical stability of the solution has first been established. Usage in Adults: Opioid Overdose—Known or Suspected: An initial dose of 0.4 mg to 2 mg of naloxone hydrochloride may be administered intravenously. If the desired degree of counteraction and improvement in respiratory functions is not obtained, it may be repeated at 2 to 3 minute intervals. If no response is observed after 10 mg of naloxone hydrochloride have been administered, the diagnosis of opioid induced or partial opioid induced toxicity should be questioned. Intramuscular or subcutaneous administration may be necessary if the intravenous route is not available. Postoperative Opioid Depression: For the partial reversal of opioid depression following the use of opioids during surgery"

The dosage may then be increased by 0.25 mg/day every third day until an optimal therapeutic dosage is achieved.Permax is usually administered in divided doses 3 times per day. During dosage titration, the dosage of concurrent l-dopa/carbidopa may be cautiously decreased.In clinical studies, the mean therapeutic daily dosage of Permax was 3 mg/day. The average concurrent daily dosage of l-dopa/carbidopa (expressed as l-dopa) was approximately 650 mg/day. The efficacy of Permax at doses above 5 mg/day has not been systematically evaluated.

Because of possible physical incompatibilities, DEPO-MEDROL Sterile Aqueous Suspension should not be diluted or mixed with other solutions. The initial dosage of parenterally administered DEPO-MEDROL will vary from 4 to 120 mg depending on the specific disease entity being treated. However, in certain overwhelming, acute, life-threatening situations, administrations in dosages exceeding the usual dosages may be justified and may be in multiples of the oral doses. It Should Be Emphasized that Dosage Requirements are Variable and Must Be Individualized on the Basis of the Disease Under Treatment and the Response of the Patient. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dose should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small increments at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. Situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment. In this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of the corticosteroid for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. A. Administration for Local Effect Therapy with DEPO-MEDROL does not obviate the need for the conventional measures usually employed. Although this method of treatment will ameliorate symptoms, it is in no sense a cure and the hormone has no effect on the cause of the inflammation. 1.

Clinical improvement is usually observed within 48 hours. Children: In children 2 to 5 years of age (20 kg or less), the non-prescription liquid formulation (IMODIUM® A-D 1 mg/7.5 mL) should be used; for ages 6 to 12, either IMODIUM® Capsules or IMODIUM® A-D Liquid may be used.

Adults: The recommended initial dose is 4 mg (two capsules) followed by 2 mg (one capsule) after each unformed stool until diarrhea is controlled, after which the dosage of IMODIUM® should be reduced to meet individual requirements.

    "package_label": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Therapy with probenecid and colchicine should not be started until an acute gouty attack has subsided. However, if an acute attack is precipitated during therapy, probenecid and colchicine may be continued without changing the dosage, and additional colchicine or other appropriate therapy should be given to control the acute attack. The recommended adult dosage is 1 tablet of probenecid and colchicine daily for one week, followed by 1 tablet twice a day thereafter. Some degree of renal impairment may be present in patients with gout. A daily dosage of 2 tablets may be adequate. However, if necessary, the daily dosage may be increased by 1 tablet every four weeks within tolerance (and usually not above 4 tablets per day) if symptoms of gouty arthritis are not controlled or the 24 hour uric acid excretion is not above 700 mg. As noted, probenecid may not be effective in chronic renal insufficiency particularly when the glomerular filtration rate is 30 mL/minute or less. Gastric intolerance may be indicative of overdosage, and may be corrected by decreasing the dosage. As uric acid tends to crystallize out of an acid urine, a liberal fluid intake is recommended, as well as sufficient sodium bicarbonate (3 to 7.5 g daily) or potassium citrate (7.5 g daily) to maintain an alkaline urine (see PRECAUTIONS). Alkalization of the urine is recommended until the serum urate level returns to normal limits and tophaceous deposits disappear, i.e., during the period when urinary excretion of uric acid is at a high level. Thereafter, alkalization of the urine and the usual restriction of purine-producing foods may be somewhat relaxed. Probenecid and colchicine (or probenecid) should be continued at the dosage that will maintain normal serum urate levels. When acute attacks have been absent for six months or more and serum urate levels remain within normal limits, the daily dosage of probenecid and colchicine may be decreased by 1 tablet every six months.

Because penicillamine increases the requirement for pyridoxine, patients may require a daily supplement of pyridoxine (see PRECAUTIONS ). W i l s on 's Disease — Optimal dosage can be determined by measurement of urinary copper excretion and the determination of free copper in the serum. The urine must be collected in copper-free glassware, and should be quantitatively analyzed for copper before and soon after initiation of therapy with penicillamine capsules. Determination of 24-hour urinary copper excretion is of greatest value in the first week of therapy with penicillamine. In the absence of any drug reaction, a dose between 0.75 and 1.5 g that results in an initial 24-hour cupriuresis of over 2 mg should be continued for about three months, by which time the most reliable method of monitoring maintenance treatment is the determination of free copper in the serum. This equals the difference between quantitatively determined total copper and ceruloplasmin-copper. Adequately treated patients will usually have less than 10 mcg free copper/dL of serum. It is seldom necessary to exceed a dosage of 2 g/day. If the patient is intolerant to therapy with penicillamine capsules, alternative treatment is trientine hydrochloride. In patients who cannot tolerate as much as 1 g/day initially, initiating dosage with 250 mg/day, and increasing gradually to the requisite amount, gives closer control of the effects of the drug and may help to reduce the incidence of adverse reactions. Cy s tinuria — It is recommended that penicillamine capsules be used along with conventional therapy. By reducing urinary cystine, it decreases crystalluria and stone formation.

    "package_label": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Duodenal Ulcer Active Duodenal Ulcer Clinical studies have indicated that suppression of nocturnal acid is the most important factor in duodenal ulcer healing (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Antisecretory Activity, Acid Secretion). This is supported by recent clinical trials (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Trials, Active Duodenal Ulcer). Therefore, there is no apparent rationale, except for familiarity with use, for treating with anything other than a once-daily at bedtime dosage regimen. In a U.S. oral dose-ranging study of 400 mg at bedtime, 800 mg at bedtime and 1600 mg at bedtime, a continuous dose response relationship for ulcer healing was demonstrated. However, 800 mg at bedtime is the dose of choice for most patients, as it provides a high healing rate (the difference between 800 mg at bedtime and 1600 mg at bedtime being small), maximal pain relief, a decreased potential for drug interactions (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions) and maximal patient convenience. Patients unhealed at four weeks, or those with persistent symptoms, have been shown to benefit from two to four weeks of continued therapy. It has been shown that patients who both have an endoscopically demonstrated ulcer larger than 1 cm and are also heavy smokers (i.e., smoke one pack of cigarettes or more per day) are more difficult to heal. There is some evidence which suggests that more rapid healing can be achieved in this subpopulation with 1600 mg of cimetidine at bedtime. While early pain relief with either 800 mg at bedtime or 1600 mg at bedtime is equivalent in all patients, 1600 mg at bedtime provides an appropriate alternative when it is important to ensure healing within four weeks for this subpopulation. Alternatively, approximately 94% of all patients will also heal in eight weeks with 800 mg of cimetidine at bedtime. Other regimens of cimetidine in the United States which have been shown to be effective are: 300 mg four times daily, with meals and at bedti"

The smallest amount that will produce the desired results must be carefully determined for each individual, since optimal dosage levels of this potent drug vary from patient to patient. In general, the oral dose has been found to be approximately 2 to 3 times the parenteral dose of fluphenazine. Treatment is best instituted with a low initial dosage, which may be increased, if necessary, until the desired clinical effects are achieved. Therapeutic effect is often achieved with doses under 20 mg daily. Patients remaining severely disturbed or inadequately controlled may require upward titration of dosage. Daily doses up to 40 mg may be necessary; controlled clinical studies have not been performed to demonstrate safety of prolonged administration of such doses. When symptoms are controlled, dosage can generally be reduced gradually to daily maintenance doses of 1 mg to 5 mg, often given as a single daily dose. Continued treatment is needed to achieve maximum therapeutic benefits; further adjustments in dosage may be necessary during the course of therapy to meet the patient’s requirements. For psychotic patients who have been stabilized on a fixed daily dosage of orally administered fluphenazine hydrochloride dosage forms, conversion to the long-acting fluphenazine decanoate may be indicated (see package insert for conversion information). For geriatric patients, the suggested starting dose is 1 mg to 2.5 mg daily, adjusted according to the response of the patient."

(2.1) •Patients with non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer with biochemical recurrence at high risk for metastasis may be treated with or without a GnRH analog. (2.1) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended dosage of XTANDI is 160 mg administered orally once daily with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Advise patients to take each capsule or tablet whole with a sufficient amount of water to ensure that all medication is successfully swallowed. Do NOT chew, dissolve, or open the capsules. Do NOT cut, crush, or chew the tablets. Patients with CRPC or mCSPC receiving XTANDI should also receive a gonadotropic-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog concurrently or should have had bilateral orchiectomy.

For patients who receive XTANDI with or without a GnRH analog, treatment can be suspended if PSA is undetectable (< 0.2 ng/mL) after 36 weeks of therapy. Reinitiate treatment when PSA has increased to ≥ 2.0 ng/mL for patients who had prior radical prostatectomy or ≥ 5.0 ng/mL for patients who had prior primary radiation therapy [see Clinical Studies (14)]. 2.2 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions If a patient experiences a ≥ Grade 3 or an intolerable adverse reaction, withhold XTANDI for one week or until symptoms improve to ≤ Grade 2, then resume at the same or a reduced dose (120 mg or 80 mg) if warr"

    "package_label": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of diabetes mellitus with PRECOSE or any other pharmacologic agent. Dosage of PRECOSE must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance while not exceeding the maximum recommended dose of 100 mg t.i.d. PRECOSE should be taken three times daily at the start (with the first bite) of each main meal. PRECOSE should be started at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation as described below, both to reduce gastrointestinal side effects and to permit identification of the minimum dose required for adequate glycemic control of the patient. If the prescribed diet is not observed, the intestinal side effects may be intensified. If strongly distressing symptoms develop in spite of adherence to the diabetic diet prescribed, the doctor must be consulted and the dose temporarily or permanently reduced. During treatment initiation and dose titration (see below), one-hour postprandial plasma glucose may be used to determine the therapeutic response to PRECOSE and identify the minimum effective dose for the patient. Thereafter, glycosylated hemoglobin should be measured at intervals of approximately three months. The therapeutic goal should be to decrease both postprandial plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels to normal or near normal by using the lowest effective dose of PRECOSE, either as monotherapy or in combination with sulfonylureas, insulin or metformin. Initial Dosage The recommended starting dosage of PRECOSE is 25 mg given orally three times daily at the start (with the first bite) of each main meal. However, some patients may benefit from more gradual dose titration to minimize gastrointestinal side effects. This may be achieved by initiating treatment at 25 mg once per day and subsequently increasing the frequency of administration to achieve 25 mg t.i.d. Maintenance Dosage Once a 25 mg t.i.d. dosage regimen is reached, dosage of PRECOSE should be adjusted at 4–"

(2.1) Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. (2.1) Individualize dosing based on the severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. (2.1) Discuss availability of naloxone with the patient and caregiver and assess each patient's need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with Morphine Sulfate Oral Solution. Consider prescribing naloxone based on the patient's risk factors for overdose. (2.2, 5.2, 5.4, 5.6) Adults: Initiate treatment with Morphine Sulfate Oral Solution 10 to 20 mg every 4 hours as needed. (2.3) Pediatric Patients 2 Years of Age and Older: Initiate treatment with Morphine Oral Solution 2 mg/mL or 4 mg/mL at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg to 0.3 mg/kg every 4 hours as needed for pain. Do not exceed 20 mg as an initial dose in pediatrics. See Full Prescribing Information for complete information on pediatric dosing. (2.3) Do not abruptly discontinue Morphine Sulfate Oral Solution in a physically dependent patient because rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. (2.5) 2.1 Dosage and Administration Overview Morphine Sulfate Oral Solution is available in three concentrations: 2 mg/mL, 4 mg/mL, and 20 mg/mL [see Dosage Forms and Strengths (3)]. Morphine Sulfate Oral Solution 2 mg/mL and 4 mg/mL is indicated for use in adults and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. Morphine Sulfate Oral Solution 20 mg/mL is only indicated for use in opioid-tolerant adult patients who have already been receiving opioid therapy.

The following dosage information is based upon various regimens and indications in general use.Induction or Stimulation of Labor Intravenous infusion (drip method) is the only acceptable method of parenteral administration of oxytocin for the induction or stimulation of labor. Accurate control of the rate of infusion is essential and is best accomplished by an infusion pump. It is convenient to piggyback the ocytocin infusion on a physiologic electrolyte solution, permitting the oxytocin infusion to be stopped abruptly without interrupting the electrolyte infusion. This is done in the following way. PreparationThe standard solution for infusion of oxytocin is prepared by adding the contents of one 1-mL vial containing 10 units of oxytocin to 1000 mL of 0.9% aqueous sodium chloride or Ringer’s lactate. The combined solution containing 10 milliunits (mU) of oxytocin/mL is rotated in the infusion bottle for thorough mixing.Establish the infusion with a separate bottle of physiologic electrolyte solution not cotaining oxytocin.Attach (piggyback) the oxytocin-containing bottle with the infusion pump to the infusion line as close to the infusion site as possible.Administration The initial dose should be 0.5–1 mU/min (equal to 3–6 mL of the dilute oxytocin solution per hour). At 30–60 minute intervals the dose should be gradually increased in increments of 1–2 mU/min until the desired contraction pattern has been established. Once the desired frequency of contractions has been reached and labor has progressed to 5–6 cm dilation, the dose may be reduced by similar increments.

    "package_label": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (See WARNINGS ) For induction therapy in adult patients with AML the following dose schedule is recommended: Idarubicin hydrochloride injection 12 mg/m2 daily for 3 days by slow (10 to 15 min) intravenous injection in combination with cytarabine. The cytarabine may be given as 100 mg/m2 daily by continuous infusion for 7 days or as cytarabine 25 mg/m2 intravenous bolus followed by cytarabine 200 mg/m2 daily for 5 days continuous infusion. In patients with unequivocal evidence of leukemia after the first induction course, a second course may be administered. Administration of the second course should be delayed in patients who experience severe mucositis, until recovery from this toxicity has occurred, and a dose reduction of 25% is recommended. In patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment, a dose reduction of idarubicin hydrochloride should be considered. Idarubicin hydrochloride should not be administered if the bilirubin level exceeds 5 mg%. (See WARNINGS .) The benefit of consolidation in prolonging the duration of remissions and survival is not proven. There is no consensus regarding optional regimens to be used for consolidation. (See CLINICAL STUDIES for doses used in U.S. clinical studies.) Preparation and Administration Precautions Caution in handling the solution must be exercised as skin reactions associated with idarubicin hydrochloride may occur. Skin accidentally exposed to idarubicin hydrochloride should be washed thoroughly with soap and water and if the eyes are involved, standard irrigation techniques should be used immediately. The use of goggles, gloves, and protective gowns is recommended during preparation and administration of the drug. Care in the administration of idarubicin hydrochloride will reduce the chance of perivenous infiltration. It may also decrease the chance of local reactions such as urticaria and erythematous streaking. During intravenous administration of idarubicin hydrochloride extravasation may "

In patients with more severe or uncontrolled glaucoma, levobunolol hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 0.5% can be administered b.i.d. As with any new medication, carefully monitoring of patients is advised. Dosages above one drop of levobunolol hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 0.5% b.i.d. are not generally more effective. If the patient's IOP is not at a satisfactory level on this regimen, concomitant therapy with dipivefrin and/or epinephrine, and/or pilocarpine and other miotics, and/or systemically administered carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, such as acetazolamide, can be instituted. Patients should not typically use two or more topical ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents simultaneously."

Although the maximum tolerated dose has not been determined, clinical experience suggests that a total dose beyond 60 mg is not needed for any patient.Prior to intravenous administration, dipyridamole injection should be diluted in at least a 1:2 ratio with sodium chloride injection, 0.45%; sodium chloride injection, 0.9%; or dextrose injection, 5% for a total volume of approximately 20 to 50 mL. Infusion of undiluted dipyridamole may cause local irritation.Thallium-201 should be injected within 5 minutes following the 4-minute infusion of dipyridamole.Do not mix dipyridamole injection with other drugs in the same syringe or infusion container.Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit."

Do not administer intravenously (2.1). Do not use in insulin infusion pumps (2.1). Must be resuspended immediately before use (2.2). 2.1 Dosing NovoLog Mix 70/30 is an insulin analog with an earlier onset and intermediate duration of action in comparison to the basal human insulin premix. The addition of protamine to the rapid-acting aspart insulin analog (NovoLog) results in insulin activity that is 30% short-acting and 70% long-acting. NovoLog Mix 70/30 is typically dosed on a twice-daily basis (with each dose intended to cover 2 meals or a meal and a snack). The dosage of NovoLog Mix 70/30 must be individualized. The written prescription for NovoLog Mix 70/30 should include the full name, to avoid confusion with NovoLog (insulin aspart) and Novolin 70/30 (human premix). NovoLog Mix 70/30 should appear uniformly white and cloudy. Do not use it if it looks clear or if it contains solid particles. NovoLog Mix 70/30 should not be used after the printed expiration date. NovoLog Mix 70/30 should be administered by subcutaneous injection in the abdominal region, buttocks, thigh, or upper arm. NovoLog Mix 70/30 has a faster onset of action than human insulin premix 70/30 and should be dosed within 15 minutes before meal initiation for patients with type 1 diabetes. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosing should occur within 15 minutes before or after meal initiation. Injection sites should be rotated within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy. As with all insulins, the duration of action may vary according to the dose, injection site, blood flow, temperature, and level of physical activity. NovoLog Mix 70/30 should not be administered intravenously or used in insulin infusion pumps. Dose regimens of NovoLog Mix 70/30 will vary among patients a"

(2.1) Maintain the starting dose for at least one week and then titrate to maintain target platelet counts. (2.2) Do not exceed a dose increment of 0.5 mg/day in any one week. Do not exceed 10 mg/day or 2.5 mg in a single dose. (2.2) Moderate hepatic impairment: Start with 0.5 mg per day. (2.3) 2.1 Recommended Starting Dosage Adults: The recommended starting dosage of anagrelide capsules is 0.5 mg four times daily or 1 mg twice daily. Pediatric Patients: The recommended starting dosage of anagrelide capsules is 0.5 mg daily. 2.2 Dose Titration Based Upon Platelet Response Continue the starting dose for at least one week and then titrate to reduce and maintain the platelet count below 600,000/μL, and ideally between 150,000/μL and 400,000/μL. The dose increment should not exceed 0.5 mg/day in any one week. Dosage should not exceed 10 mg/day or 2.5 mg in a single dose. Most patients will experience an adequate response at a dose of 1.5 to 3.0 mg/day. Monitor platelet counts weekly during titration then monthly or as necessary. 2.3 Dose Modifications for Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh score 7-9) start anagrelide capsules therapy at a dose of 0.5 mg/day and monitor frequently for cardiovascular events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Patients with moderate hepatic impairment who have tolerated anagrelide capsules therapy for one week may have their dose increased. The dose increase increment should not exceed 0.5 mg/day in any one week. Avoid use of anagrelide capsules in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 2.4 Clinical Monitoring Anagrelide capsules therapy requires clinical monitoring, including complete blood counts, assessment of hepatic and renal function, and electrolytes.

The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocorticoid activity the least when given at the time of maximal activity (am) for single dose administration. Therefore, it is recommended that prednisone be administered in the morning prior to 9 am and when large doses are given, administration of antacids between meals to help prevent peptic ulcers. Multiple dose therapy should be evenly distributed in evenly spaced intervals throughout the day. Dietary salt restriction may be advisable in patients. Do not stop taking this medicine without first talking to your doctor. Avoid abrupt withdraw of therapy. The initial dosage of prednisone may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg per day, depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice, while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small increments at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status sec"

(2.1) For children, the dose should be calculated on the basis of 35 mg for each ten pounds of body weight (7.7 mg/kg body weight). (2.2) Do not mix or dilute with other solutions or drugs. (2.2) 2.1 Dosing Adult Dose The recommended dosage of AK-FLUOR® 10% (100 mg/mL) is 500 mg via intravenous administration. Pediatric Dose For children, the dose is 7.7 mg/kg (actual body weight) up to a maximum of 500 mg, via intravenous infusion calculated on the basis of 35 mg for each 10 lbs. (4.54 kg) of body weight. 2.2 Preparation for Administration Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not mix or dilute with other solutions or drugs. 2.3 Administration Inject the dose (over 5-10 seconds is normally recommended) into the antecubital vein, after taking precautions to avoid extravasation. A syringe, filled with AK-FLUOR®, may be attached to transparent tubing and a 23 gauge butterfly needle for injection. Insert the needle and draw the patient's blood to the hub of the syringe so that a small air bubble separates the patient's blood in the tubing from the fluorescein. With the room lights on, slowly inject the blood back into the vein while watching the skin over the needle tip. If the needle has extravasated, the patient's blood will be seen to bulge the skin and the injection should be stopped before any fluorescein is injected. When assured that extravasation has not occurred, the room light may be turned off and the fluorescein injection completed. Luminescence usually appears in the retina and choroidal vessels in 7 to 14 seconds and can be observed by standard viewing equipment. Reduction in dose from 500 mg to 200 mg of AK-FLUOR® 10% may be appropriate in cases when a highly sensitive imaging system e.g., scanning laser ophthalmoscope is used."

    "package_label": "Dosage and Administration (see indications and usage): Adult Patients: Treatment of mild to moderate malaria in adults caused by P. vivax or mefloquine-susceptible strains of P. falciparum: Five tablets (1250 mg) mefloquine hydrochloride to be given as a single oral dose. The drug should not be taken on an empty stomach and should be administered with at least 8 oz (240 mL) of water. If a full-treatment course with mefloquine does not lead to improvement within 48 to 72 hours, mefloquine hydrochloride tablets should not be used for retreatment. An alternative therapy should be used. Similarly, if previous prophylaxis with mefloquine has failed, mefloquine hydrochloride tablets should not be used for curative treatment. Note: Patients with acute P. vivax malaria, treated with mefloquine, are at high risk of relapse because mefloquine does not eliminate exoerythrocytic (hepatic phase) parasites. To avoid relapse after initial treatment of the acute infection with mefloquine, patients should subsequently be treated with an 8-aminoquinoline derivative (e.g., primaquine). Malaria Prophylaxis: One 250 mg mefloquine hydrochloride tablet once weekly. Prophylactic drug administration should begin 1 week before arrival in an endemic area. Subsequent weekly doses should be taken regularly, always on the same day of each week, preferably after the main meal. To reduce the risk of malaria after leaving an endemic area, prophylaxis must be continued for 4 additional weeks to ensure suppressive blood levels of the drug when merozoites emerge from the liver. Tablets should not be taken on an empty stomach and should be administered with at least 8 oz (240 mL) of water. In certain cases, e.g., when a traveler is taking other medication, it may be desirable to start prophylaxis 2 to 3 weeks prior to departure, in order to ensure that the combination of drugs is well tolerated (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions). When prophylaxis with mefloquine fails, physicians should carefully eva"

Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS). After observing the response to initial therapy with tolmetin sodium, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs. For the relief of rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, the recommended starting dose for adults is 400 mg three times daily (1200 mg daily), preferably including a dose on arising and a dose at bedtime. To achieve optimal therapeutic effect the dose should be adjusted according to the patient's response after 1 or 2 weeks. Control is usually achieved at doses of 600 mg to 1800 mg daily in divided doses (generally t.i.d.). Doses larger than 1800 mg/day have not been studied and are not recommended. For the relief of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, the recommended starting dose for pediatric patients (2 years and older) is 20 mg/kg/day in divided doses (t.i.d. or q.i.d.). When control has been achieved, the usual dose ranges from 15 to 30 mg/kg/day. Doses higher than 30 mg/kg/day have not been studied, and, therefore, are not recommended. A therapeutic response to tolmetin sodium can be expected in a few days to a week. Progressive improvement can be anticipated during succeeding weeks of therapy. If gastrointestinal symptoms occur, tolmetin can be administered with antacids other than sodium bicarbonate. Tolmetin sodium bioavailability and pharmacokinetics are not significantly affected by acute or chronic administration of magnesium and aluminum hydroxides; however, bioavailability is affected by food or milk (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug-Food Interaction)."

After observing the response to initial therapy with diflunisal tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs. Concentration-dependent pharmacokinetics prevail when diflunisal is administered; a doubling of dosage produces a greater than doubling of drug accumulation. The effect becomes more apparent with repetitive doses. For mild to moderate pain, an initial dose of 1000 mg followed by 500 mg every 12 hours is recommended for most patients. Following the initial dose, some patients may require 500 mg every 8 hours. A lower dosage may be appropriate depending on such factors as pain severity, patient response, weight, or advanced age; for example, 500 mg initially, followed by 250 mg every 8 to 12 hours. For osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, the suggested dosage range is 500 mg to 1000 mg daily in two divided doses. The dosage of diflunisal may be increased or decreased according to patient response. Maintenance doses higher than 1500 mg a day are not recommended. Tablets should be swallowed whole, not crushed or chewed."

Hospitalize patients being initiated or re-initiated on sotalol for at least 3 days or until steady-state drug levels are achieved, in a facility that can provide cardiac resuscitation and continuous electrocardiographic monitoring. Initiate oral sotalol therapy in the presence of personnel trained in the management of serious arrhythmias. Perform a baseline ECG to determine the QT interval and measure and normalize serum potassium and magnesium levels before initiating therapy. Measure serum creatinine and calculate an estimated creatinine clearance in order to establish the appropriate dosing interval. Monitor QTc 2 to 4 hours after each uptitration in dose. Discharge patients on sotalol therapy from an in-patient setting with an adequate supply of sotalol to allow uninterrupted therapy until the patient can fill a sotalol prescription. Advise patients who miss a dose to take the next dose at the usual time. Do not double the dose or shorten the dosing interval. 2.2 Adult Dose for Ventricular Arrhythmias The recommended initial dose is 80 mg twice daily. This dose may be increased in increments of 80 mg per day every 3 days provided the QTc <500 msec [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Continually monitor patients until steady state blood levels are achieved. In most patients, a therapeutic response is obtained at a total daily dose of 160 to 320 mg/day, given in two or three divided doses. Oral doses as"

Renal Transplant Patients: • Administer once daily by mouth, consistently with or without food (2). • Administer the initial dose as soon as possible after transplantation and 4 hours after CsA (2.1, 7.1). • Adjust the sirolimus maintenance dose to achieve sirolimus trough concentrations within the target-range (2.5). • Hepatic impairment: Reduce maintenance dose in patients with hepatic impairment (2.7, 8.6, 12.3). In renal transplant patients at low- to moderate-immunologic risk: · Sirolimus and CsA Combination Therapy: One loading dose of 6 mg on day 1, followed by daily maintenance doses of 2 mg (2.2). · Sirolimus Following CsA Withdrawal: 2 to 4 months post-transplantation, withdraw CsA over 4 to 8 weeks (2.2). In renal transplant patients at high-immunologic risk: · Sirolimus and CsA Combination Therapy (for the first 12 months post-transplantation): One loading dose of up to 15 mg on day 1, followed by daily maintenance doses of 5 mg (2.3). 2.1 General Dosing Guidance for Renal Transplant Patients The initial dose of sirolimus tablets should be administered as soon as possible after transplantation. It is recommended that sirolimus tablets be taken 4 hours after administration of cyclosporine oral solution (MODIFIED) and or/cyclosporine capsules (MODIFIED) [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Frequent sirolimus tablets dose adjustments based on non-steady-state sirolimus concentrations can lead to overdosing or underdosing because sirolimus has a long half-life.

KEPPRA is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of myoclonic seizures in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. KEPPRA is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in adults and children 6 years of age and older with idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Partial Onset Seizures Adults 16 Years And Older In clinical trials, daily doses of 1000 mg, 2000 mg, and 3000 mg, given as twice-daily dosing, were shown to be effective. Although in some studies there was a tendency toward greater response with higher dose (see CLINICAL STUDIES), a consistent increase in response with increased dose has not been shown. Treatment should be initiated with a daily dose of 1000 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg BID). Additional dosing increments may be given (1000 mg/day additional every 2 weeks) to a maximum recommended daily dose of 3000 mg. Doses greater than 3000 mg/day have been used in open-label studies for periods of 6 months and longer. There is no evidence that doses greater than 3000 mg/day confer additional benefit. Pediatric Patients Ages 4 To <16 Years Treatment should be initiated with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg BID). The daily dose should be increased every 2 weeks by increments of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg (30 mg/kg BID). If a patient cannot tolerate a daily dose of 60 mg/kg, the daily dose may be reduced. In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 52 mg/kg. Patients with body weight ≤ 20 kg should be dosed with oral solution. Patients with body weight above 20 kg can be dosed with either tablets or oral solution. Table 15 below provides a guideline for tablet dosing based on weight during titration to 60 mg/kg/day. Only whole tablets should be ad"

Treatment for periods longer than two weeks is not recommended. Hepatic Coma For use as an adjunct in the management of hepatic coma, the recommended dose is 4 to 12 grams per day given in the following regimen: Withdraw protein from diet. Avoid use of diuretic agents. Give supportive therapy, including blood products, as indicated. Give neomycin sulfate tablets in doses of 4 to 12 grams of neomycin sulfate per day (eight to 24 tablets) in divided doses. Treatment should be continued over a period of five to six days, during which time protein should be returned incrementally to the diet. If less potentially toxic drugs cannot be used for chronic hepatic insufficiency, neomycin in doses of up to four grams daily (eight tablets per day) may be necessary. The risk for the development of neomycin-induced toxicity progressively increases when treatment must be extended to preserve the life of a patient with hepatic encephalopathy who has failed to fully respond. Frequent periodic monitoring of these patients to ascertain the presence of drug toxicity is mandatory (see PRECAUTIONS). Also, neomycin serum concentrations should be monitored to avoid potentially toxic levels. The benefits to the patient should be weighed against the risks of nephrotoxicity, permanent ototoxicity and neuromuscular blockade following the accumulation of neomycin in the tissues. Preoperative Prophylaxis for Elective Colorectal Surgery Listed below is an example of a recommended bowel preparation regimen. A proposed surgery time of 8:00 a.m. has been used. Pre-op Day 3: Minimum residue or clear liquid diet. Bisacodyl, 1 tablet orally at 6:00 p.m. Pre-op Day 2: Minimum residue or clear liquid diet. Magnesium sulfate, 30 mL, 50% solution (15 g) orally at 10:00 a.m., 2:00 p.m., and 6:00 p.m. Enema at 7:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. Pre-op Day 1: Clear"

The dosages suggested in this table are for normal healthy adults and refer to the use of epinephrine-free solutions. When larger volumes are required only solutions containing epinephrine should be used, except in those cases where vasopressor drugs may be contraindicated. There have been adverse event reports of chondrolysis in patients receiving intra-articular infusions of local anesthetics following arthroscopic and other surgical procedures. Lidocaine is not approved for this use (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). These recommended doses serve only as a guide to the amount of anesthetic required for most routine procedures. The actual volumes and concentrations to be used depend on a number of factors such as type and extent of surgical procedure, depth of anesthesia and degree of muscular relaxation required, duration of anesthesia required, and the physical condition of the patient. In all cases the lowest concentration and smallest dose that will produce the desired result should be given. Dosages should be reduced for children and for elderly and debilitated patients and patients with cardiac and/or liver disease. The onset of anesthesia, the duration of anesthesia and the degree of muscular relaxation are proportional to the volume and concentration (i.e., total dose) of local anesthetic used. Thus, an increase in volume and concentration of Lidocaine Hydrochloride Injection will decrease the onset of anesthesia, prolong the duration of anesthesia, provide a greater degree of muscular relaxation and increase the segmental spread of anesthesia. However, increasing the volume and concentration of Lidocaine Hydrochloride Injection may result in a more profound fall in blood pressure when used in epidural anesthesia.

Status Epilepticus General AdviceStatus epilepticus is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with a high risk of permanent neurological impairment, if inadequately treated. The treatment of status, however, requires far more than the administration of an anticonvulsant agent. It involves observation and management of all parameters critical to maintaining vital function and the capacity to provide support of those functions as required. Ventilatory support must be readily available. The use of benzodiazepines, like lorazepam injection, is ordinarily only an initial step of a complex and sustained intervention which may require additional interventions, (e.g., concomitant intravenous administration of phenytoin). Because status epilepticus may result from a correctable acute cause such as hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, or other metabolic or toxic derangement, such an abnormality must be immediately sought and corrected. Furthermore, patients who are susceptible to further seizure episodes should receive adequate maintenance antiepileptic therapy.Any health care professional who intends to treat a patient with status epilepticus should be familiar with this package insert and the pertinent medical literature concerning current concepts for the treatment of status epilepticus. A comprehensive review of the considerations critical to the informed and prudent management of status epilepticus cannot be provided in drug product labeling. The archival medical literature contains many informative references on the management of status epilepticus, among them the report of the working group on status epilepticus of the Epilepsy Foundat"

    "package_label": "DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Glaucoma Acetazolamide should be used as an adjunct to the usual therapy. The dosage employed in the treatment of chronic simple (open-angle) glaucomaranges from 250 mg to 1 g of acetazolamide per 24 hours, usually in divided doses for amounts over 250 mg. It has usually been found that a dosage in excess of 1 g per 24 hours does not produce an increased effect. In all cases, the dosage should be adjusted with careful individual attention both to symptomatology and ocular tension. Continuous supervision by a physician is advisable. In treatment of secondary glaucoma and in the preoperative treatment of some cases of acute congestive (closed-angle) glaucoma, the preferred dosage is 250 mg every four hours, although some cases have responded to 250 mg twice daily on short-term therapy. In some acute cases, it may be more satisfactory to administer an initial dose of 500 mg followed by 125 mg or 250 mg every four hours depending on the individual case. A complementary effect has been noted when acetazolamide has been used in conjunction with miotics or mydriatics as the case demanded. Epilepsy It is not clearly known whether the beneficial effects observed in epilepsy are due to direct inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the central nervous system or whether they are due to the slight degree of acidosis produced by the divided dosage. The best results to date have been seen in petit mal in pediatric patients. Good results, however, have been seen in patients, both pediatric patients and adult, in other types of seizures such as grand mal, mixed seizure patterns, myoclonic jerk patterns, etc. The suggested total daily dose is 8 to 30 mg per kg in divided doses. Although some patients respond to a low dose, the optimum range appears to be from 375 to 1000 mg daily. However, some investigators feel that daily doses in excess of 1 g do not produce any better results than a 1 g dose. When acetazolamide tablets are given in combination with other anti"

This dose should be titrated according to individual patient response to gain maximal therapeutic benefit while maintaining lowest dosage possible. A single dose given in the morning with food is recommended; divided daily doses are unnecessary. Hypertension Initiation: Therapy, in most patients, should be initiated with a single daily dose of 25 mg. If the response is insufficient after a suitable trial, the dosage may be increased to a single daily dose of 50 mg. If additional control is required, the dosage of chlorthalidone may be increased to 100 mg once daily or a second antihypertensive drug (step 2 therapy) may be added. Dosage above 100 mg daily usually does not increase effectiveness. Increases in serum uric acid and decreases in serum potassium are dose-related over the 25 to 100 mg/day range. Maintenance: Maintenance doses may be lower than initial doses and should be adjusted according to individual patient response. Effectiveness is well sustained during continued use. Edema Initiation: Adults, initially 50 to 100 mg daily, or 100 mg on alternate days. Some patients may require 150 to 200 mg at these intervals or up to 200 mg daily. Dosages above this level, however, do not usually produce a greater response. Maintenance: Maintenance doses may often be lower than initial doses and should be adjusted according to individual patient response. Effectiveness is well sustained during continued use."

Children Age, weight, and severity of the infection are important factors in determining the proper dosage. In mild to moderate infections, the usual dosage of erythromycin ethylsuccinate for children is 30 to 50 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses every 6 hours. For more severe infections, this dosage may be doubled. If twice-a-day dosage is desired, one-half of the total daily dose may be given every 12 hours. Doses may also be given three times daily by administering one-third of the total daily dose every 8 hours. The following dosage schedule is suggested for mild to moderate infections: Body Weight Total Daily Dose Under 10 lbs 30 to 50 mg/kg/day15 to 25 mg/lb/day 10 to 15 lbs 200 mg 16 to 25 lbs 400 mg 26 to 50 lbs 800 mg 51 to 100 lbs 1200 mg over 100 lbs 1600 mg Adults 400 mg erythromycin ethylsuccinate every 6 hours is the usual dose. Dosage may be increased up to 4 g per day according to the severity of the infection. If twice-a-day dosage is desired, one-half of the total daily dose may be given every 12 hours. Doses may also be given three times daily by administering one-third of the total daily dose every 8 hours. For adult dosage calculation, use a ratio of 400 mg of erythromycin activity as the ethylsuccinate to 250 mg of erythromycin activity as the stearate, base or estolate. In the treatment of streptococcal infections, a therapeutic dosage of erythromycin ethylsuccinate should be administered for at least 10 days. In continuous prophylaxis against recurrences of streptococcal infections in persons with a history of rheumatic heart disease, the usual dosage is 400 mg twice a day. For Treatment of Urethritis Due to C. trachomatis or U. urealyticum 800 mg three times a day for 7 days. For Treatment of Primary Syphilis Adults: 48 to 64 g given in divided doses over a period of 10 to 15 days. For Intestinal Amebiasis Adults: 400 mg four times"

At the dosage required, there is a marked variation in the tolerance to the drug. Young patients may tolerate higher doses than older individuals. Concurrent administration of folinic acid is strongly recommended in all patients. The adult starting dose is 50 to 75 mg of the drug daily, together with 1 to 4 g daily of a sulfonamide of the sulfapyrimidine type, e.g. sulfadoxine. This dosage is ordinarily continued for 1 to 3 weeks, depending on the response of the patient and tolerance to therapy. The dosage may then be reduced to about one half that previously given for each drug and continued for an additional 4 to 5 weeks. The pediatric dosage of pyrimethamine tablets is 1 mg/kg/day divided into 2 equal daily doses; after 2 to 4 days this dose may be reduced to one half and continued for approximately 1 month. The usual pediatric sulfonamide dosage is used in conjunction with pyrimethamine tablets."

BYETTA should not be administered after a meal. Based on clinical response, the dose of BYETTA can be increased to 10 mcg twice daily after 1 month of therapy. Initiation with 5 mcg reduces the incidence and severity of gastrointestinal side effects. Each dose should be administered as a subcutaneous (SC) injection in the thigh, abdomen, or upper arm. Do not mix BYETTA with insulin. Do not transfer BYETTA from the pen to a syringe or a vial. No data are available on the safety or efficacy of intravenous or intramuscular injection of BYETTA.

As with all potent drugs, the best dose is the lowest dose that will produce the desired clinical effect. Since extrapyramidal symptoms increase in frequency and severity with increased dosage, it is important to employ the lowest effective dose. These symptoms have disappeared upon reduction of dosage, withdrawal of the drug, or administration of an antiparkinsonian agent. Prolonged administration of doses exceeding 24 mg daily should be reserved for hospitalized patients or patients under continued observation for early detection and management of adverse reactions. An antiparkinsonian agent, such as trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride or benztropine mesylate, is valuable in controlling drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms. Suggested dosages for various conditions follow: Moderately disturbed nonhospitalized patients with schizophrenia 4 to 8 mg t.i.d. initially; reduce as soon as possible to minimum effective dosage. Hospitalized patients with schizophrenia 8 to 16 mg b.i.d. to q.i.d.; avoid dosages in excess of 64 mg daily. Severe nausea and vomiting in adults 8 to 16 mg daily in divided doses; 24 mg occasionally may be necessary; early dosage reduction is desirable. Elderly Patients With increasing age, plasma concentrations of perphenazine per daily ingested dose increase. Geriatric dosages of perphenazine preparations have not been established, but initiation of lower dosages is recommended. Optimal clinical effect or benefit may require lower doses for a longer duration. Dosing of perphenazine may occur before bedtime, if required."

    "package_label": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION When estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, progestin should also be initiated to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus does not need progestin. Use of estrogen, alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Patients should be reevaluated periodically as clinically appropriate (e.g., 3-month to 6-month intervals) to determine if treatment is still necessary [see BOXED WARNINGS and WARNINGS ]. For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, such as endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. Care should be taken to inject deeply into the upper, outer quadrant of the gluteal muscle following the usual precautions for intramuscular administration. By virtue of the low viscosity of the vehicles, the various preparations of DELESTROGEN (estradiol valerate injection, USP) may be administered with a small gauge needle (i.e., 20 Gauge x 1 1/2 inches long). Since the 40 mg potency provides a high concentration in a small volume, particular care should be observed to administer the full dose. DELESTROGEN should be visually inspected for particulate matter and color prior to administration; the solution is clear, colorless to yellow. Storage at low temperatures may result in the separation of some crystalline material which redissolves readily on warming. Note: A dry needle and syringe should be used. Use of a wet needle or syringe may cause the solution to become cloudy; however, this does not affect the potency of the material. Patients should be started at the lowest dose for the indication. The lowest effective dose of DELESTROGEN has not been determined for any indication. Treated patients with an intact uterus should be monitored closely fo"

    "package_label": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Benazepril is an effective treatment of hypertension in once-daily doses of 10-80 mg, while hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5-50 mg per day. In clinical trials of benazepril/hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy using benazepril doses of 5-20 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25-25 mg, the antihypertensive effects increased with increasing dose of either component. The side effects (see WARNINGS) of benazepril are generally rare and apparently independent of dose; those of hydrochlorothiazide are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily hypokalemia) and dose-independent phenomena (e.g., pancreatitis), the former much more common than the latter. Therapy with any combination of benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide will be associated with both sets of dose-independent side effects, but regimens in which benazepril is combined with low doses of hydrochlorothiazide produce minimal effects on serum potassium. In clinical trials of Lotensin HCT, the average change in serum potassium was near zero in subjects who received 5/6.25 mg or 20/12.5 mg, but the average subject who received 10/12.5 mg or 20/25 mg experienced a mild reduction in serum potassium, similar to that experienced by the average subject receiving the same dose of hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy. To minimize dose-independent side effects, it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy. Dose Titration Guided by Clinical Effect: A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with benazepril monotherapy may be switched to Lotensin HCT 10/12.5 or Lotensin HCT 20/12.5. Further increases of either or both components could depend on clinical response. The hydrochlorothiazide dose should generally not be increased until 2-3 weeks have elapsed. Patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with 25 mg of daily hydrochlorothiazide, but who experience signi"

Clinical experience with daily doses above 1,600 mg is limited. Entacapone tablets should always be administered in association with levodopa and carbidopa. Entacapone has no antiparkinsonian effect of its own. In clinical studies, the majority of patients required a decrease in daily levodopa dose if their daily dose of levodopa had been greater than or equal to 800 mg or if patients had moderate or severe dyskinesia before beginning treatment. To optimize an individual patient’s response, reductions in daily levodopa dose or extending the interval between doses may be necessary. In clinical studies, the average reduction in daily levodopa dose was about 25% in those patients requiring a levodopa dose reduction. (More than 58% of patients with levodopa doses above 800 mg daily required such a reduction.) Entacapone tablets can be combined with both the immediate and sustained-release formulations of levodopa and carbidopa. Entacapone tablets may be taken with or without food (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Patients With Impaired Hepatic Function Patients with hepatic impairment should be treated with caution. The AUC and C max of entacapone approximately doubled in patients with documented liver disease, compared to controls. However, these studies were conducted with single-dose entacapone without levodopa and dopa decarboxylase inhibitor coadministration, and therefore the effects of liver disease on the kinetics of chronically administered entacapone have not been evaluated (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics of Entacapone). Withdrawing Patients from Entacapone Tablets Rapid withdrawal or abrupt reduction in the entacapone tablets dose could lead to emergence of signs and symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies), "

    "package_label": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION After initiating FSH therapy on Day 2 or 3 of the cycle, Ganirelix Acetate Injection 250 mcg may be administered subcutaneously once daily during the mid to late portion of the follicular phase. By taking advantage of endogenous pituitary FSH secretion, the requirement for exogenously administered FSH may be reduced. Treatment with Ganirelix Acetate should be continued daily until the day of hCG administration. When a sufficient number of follicles of adequate size are present, as assessed by ultrasound, final maturation of follicles is induced by administering hCG. The administration of hCG should be withheld in cases where the ovaries are abnormally enlarged on the last day of FSH therapy to reduce the chance of developing OHSS (Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome). Directions for Using Ganirelix Acetate Injection Ganirelix Acetate Injection is supplied in a single dose, sterile, prefilled syringe and is intended for SUBCUTANEOUS administration only. Air bubble(s) may be seen in the pre-filled syringe. This is expected, and removal of the air bubble(s) is not needed. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water. The most convenient sites for SUBCUTANEOUS injection are in the abdomen around the navel or upper thigh. The injection site should be swabbed with a disinfectant to remove any surface bacteria. Clean about two inches around the point where the needle will be inserted and let the disinfectant dry for at least one minute before proceeding. With syringe held upward, remove needle cover. Pinch up a large area of skin between the finger and thumb. Vary the injection site a little with each injection. The needle should be inserted at the base of the pinched-up skin at an angle of 45–90° to the skin surface. When the needle is correctly positioned, it will be difficult to draw back on the plunger. If any blood is drawn into the syringe, the needle tip has penetrated a vein or artery. If this happens, withdraw the needle slightly and repositio"

Amphotericin B overdoses can result in potentially fatal cardiac or cardiopulmonary arrest (see WARNINGS and OVERDOSAGE ). Amphotericin B for Injection should be administered by slow intravenous infusion. Intravenous infusion should be given over a period of approximately 2 to 6 hours (depending on the dose) observing the usual precautions for intravenous therapy (see PRECAUTIONS: General ). The recommended concentration for intravenous infusion is 0.1 mg/mL (1mg/10mL). Since patient tolerance varies greatly, the dosage of amphotericin B must be individualized and adjusted according to the patient's clinical status (e.g., site and severity of infection, etiologic agent, cardio-renal function, etc.). A single intravenous test dose (1 mg in 20 mL of 5% dextrose solution) administered over 20 to 30 minutes may be preferred. The patient's temperature, pulse, respiration, and blood pressure should be recorded every 30 minutes for 2 to 4 hours. In patients with good cardio-renal function and a well tolerated test dose, therapy is usually initiated with a daily dose of 0.25 mg/kg of body weight. However, in those patients having severe and rapidly progressive fungal infection, therapy may be initiated with a daily dose of 0.3 mg/kg of body weight. In patients with impaired cardio-renal function or a severe reaction to the test dose, therapy should be initiated with smaller daily doses (i.e., 5 to 10 mg). Depending on the patient's cardio-renal status (see PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests ), doses may gradually be increased by 5 to 10 mg per day to final daily dosage of 0.5 to 0.7 mg/kg. There are insufficient data presently available to define total dosage requirements and duration of treatment necessary for eradication of specific mycoses. The optimal dose is unknown. Total daily dosage may range up to 1.0 mg/kg per day or up to 1.5 "

Ethambutol hydrochloride tablets should be administered on a once every 24-hour basis only. Absorption is not significantly altered by administration with food. Therapy, in general, should be continued until bacteriological conversion has become permanent and maximal clinical improvement has occurred. Ethambutol hydrochloride tablets are not recommended for use in pediatric patients under 13 years of age since safe conditions for use have not been established. Initial Treatment: In patients who have not received previous antituberculous therapy, administer ethambutol hydrochloride tablets 15 mg/kg (7 mg/lb) of body weight, as a single oral dose once every 24 hours. In the more recent studies, isoniazid has been administered concurrently in a single, daily, oral dose. Retreatment: In patients who have received previous antituberculous therapy, administer ethambutol hydrochloride tablets 25 mg/kg (11 mg/lb) of body weight, as a single oral dose once every 24 hours. Concurrently administer at least one other antituberculous drug to which the organisms have been demonstrated to be susceptible by appropriate in vitro tests. Suitable drugs usually consist of those not previously used in the treatment of the patient. After 60 days of ethambutol hydrochloride tablets administration, decrease the dose to 15 mg/kg (7 mg/lb) of body weight, and administer as a single oral dose once every 24 hours. During the period when a patient is on a daily dose of 25 mg/kg, monthly eye examinations are advised. See Table for easy selection of proper weight-dose tablet(s).

(2.1) Children undergoing cardio-pulmonary bypass should receive an additional dose of Synagis as soon as possible after the cardio-pulmonary bypass procedure (even if sooner than a month from the previous dose). Thereafter, doses should be administered monthly as scheduled. (2.1, 12.3) 2.1 Dosing Information The recommended dose of Synagis is 15 mg per kg of body weight given monthly by intramuscular injection. The first dose of Synagis should be administered prior to commencement of the RSV season and the remaining doses should be administered monthly throughout the RSV season. Children who develop an RSV infection should continue to receive monthly doses throughout the RSV season. In the northern hemisphere, the RSV season typically commences in November and lasts through April, but it may begin earlier or persist later in certain communities. Synagis serum levels are decreased after cardio-pulmonary bypass [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Children undergoing cardio-pulmonary bypass should receive an additional dose of Synagis as soon as possible after the cardio-pulmonary bypass procedure (even if sooner than a month from the previous dose). Thereafter, doses should be administered monthly as scheduled. The efficacy of Synagis at doses less than 15 mg per kg, or of dosing less frequently than monthly throughout the RSV season, has not been established. 2.2 Administration Instructions DO NOT DILUTE THE PRODUCT. DO NOT SHAKE OR VIGOROUSLY AGITATE THE VIAL. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not use any vials exhibiting particulate matter or discoloration. Using aseptic techniques, attach a sterile needle to a sterile syringe. Remove the flip top from the Synagis vial and wipe the rub"

    "package_label": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Generally, it is recommended that Zithranol-RR cream be applied once a day. Anthralin is known to be a potential skin irritant. The irritant potential of anthralin is directly related to the strength being used, the time of contact, and each patient’s individual tolerance. Where the response to anthralin treatment has not previously been established, commence treatment using a short contact time (5 – 15 min.) for at least one week. When a short contact time is used initially, it can be increased stepwise to thirty minutes before removing the cream by washing or showering. The optimal period of contact will vary according to the patient’s response to treatment. For the skin: Apply sparingly to the psoriatic lesions avoiding normal skin and rub gently and carefully into the skin. Avoid applying an excessive quantity which may cause unnecessary soiling and staining of the clothing and/or bed linen. At the end of each period of treatment, rinse the skin thoroughly with cool to lukewarm water before washing with soap. The margins of the lesions may gradually become stained purple/brown as treatment progresses, but this will disappear after cessation of treatment. For the scalp: Wash the hair with shampoo, rinse with water and apply Zithranol-RR cream while the hair is still damp. Rub the cream well into the psoriatic lesions. Keep Zithranol-RR cream away from the eyes. Care should be taken to avoid application to uninvolved scalp margins. Remove any unintended residue which may be deposited behind the ears. At the end of each period of contact, rinse hair and scalp thoroughly with cool to lukewarm water and then shampoo the hair and scalp to remove any surplus cream. This treatment may be repeated on alternate days if necessary."

The dosage of XALATAN Sterile Ophthalmic Solution should not exceed once daily; the combined use of two or more prostaglandins, or prostaglandin analogs including XALATAN Sterile Ophthalmic Solution is not recommended. It has been shown that administration of these prostaglandin drug products more than once daily may decrease the intraocular pressure lowering effect or cause paradoxical elevations in IOP. Reduction of the intraocular pressure starts approximately 3 to 4 hours after administration and the maximum effect is reached after 8 to 12 hours. XALATAN may be used concomitantly with other topical ophthalmic drug products to lower intraocular pressure. If more than one topical ophthalmic drug is being used, the drugs should be administered at least five (5) minutes apart."

The injection is especially useful for psychotic patients with acute dystonic reactions or other reactions that make oral medication difficult or impossible. It is recommended also when a more rapid response is desired than can be obtained with tablets. Because of cumulative action, therapy should be initiated with a low dose which is increased gradually at five or six-day intervals to the smallest amount necessary for optimal relief. Increases should be made in increments of 0.5 mg to a maximum of 6 mg or until optimal results are obtained without excessive adverse reactions. Postencephalitic and Idiopathic Parkinsonism — The usual daily dose is 1 to 2 mg with a range of 0.5 to 6 mg orally or parenterally. As with any agent used in parkinsonism, dosage must be individualized according to age and weight, and the type of parkinsonism being treated. Generally, older patients, and thin patients cannot tolerate large doses. Most patients with postencephalitic parkinsonism need fairly large doses and tolerate them well. Patients with a poor mental outlook are usually poor candidates for therapy. In idiopathic parkinsonism, therapy may be initiated with a single daily dose of 0.5 to 1 mg at bedtime. In some patients, this will be adequate; in others 4 to 6 mg a day may be required. In postencephalitic parkinsonism, therapy may be initiated in most patients with 2 mg a day in one or more doses. In highly sensitive patients, therapy may be initiated with 0.5 mg at bedtime, and increased as necessary. Some patients experience greatest relief by taking the entire dose at bedtime, others react more favorably to divided doses, two to four times a day. Frequently, one dose a day is sufficient and divided doses may be unnecessary or undesirable. The long duration of action of this drug makes it particularly suitable for bedtime medication when its effects may las"

As individuals may vary in their response to different doses of almotriptan tablets, the choice of dose should be made on an individual basis. If the headache is relieved after the initial almotriptan tablet dose but returns, the dose may be repeated after 2 hours. The effectiveness of a second dose has not been established in placebo-controlled trials. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 25 mg. The safety of treating an average of more than four migraines in a 30-day period has not been established. 2.2 Hepatic Impairment The recommended starting dose of almotriptan tablets in patients with hepatic impairment is 6.25 mg. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 12.5 mg over a 24-hour period [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.3 Renal Impairment The recommended starting dose of almotriptan tablets in patients with severe renal impairment is 6.25 mg.

Prophylactic Nitrate Therapy: Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safely co‑administered with short- and long-acting nitrates. Beta-blockers: Nicardipine hydrochloride capsules may be safely co-administered with beta-blockers (see Drug Interactions ). Hypertension The dose of nicardipine hydrochloride capsules should be individually adjusted according to the blood pressure response beginning with 20 mg three times daily. The effective doses in clinical trials have ranged from 20 mg to 40 mg three times daily. The maximum blood pressure lowering effect occurs approximately 1 hour to 2 hours after dosing. To assess the adequacy of blood pressure response, the blood pressure should be measured at trough (8 hours after dosing). Because of the prominent peak effects of nicardipine, blood pressure should be measured 1 hour to 2 hours after dosing, particularly during initiation of therapy (see PRECAUTIONS: Blood Pressure , INDICATIONS and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Effects in Hypertension ). At least 3 days should be allowed before increasing the nicardipine hydrochloride capsules dose to ensure achievement of steady-state plasma drug concentrations.

For continuous or intermittent irrigation, the rate of administration will correspond roughly to the rate of urine flow and should be adjusted to maintain a urinary effluent pH of 4.5 to 5.0. Nitrazine or other pH paper may be used to monitor pH, preferably at least four times daily. Drip rate should be adjusted as necessary to maintain desired pH; increasing flow rate reduces pH value and vice versa. With continuous or intermittent irrigation, each patient will require a volume of approximately 500 to 1500 mL per 24 hours. Some additives may be incompatible. Consult with pharmacist. When introducing additives, use aseptic techniques. Mix thoroughly. Do not store. This drug product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit."

(2.1) Individualize the dose for each patient. (2.1) Peripheral nerve stimulator recommended for determination of drug response and need for additional doses, and to evaluate recovery. (2.1) Store Rocuronium bromide with cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product. (2.1) Tracheal intubation: Recommended initial dose is 0.6 mg/kg. (2.2) Rapid sequence intubation: 0.6 to 1.2 mg/kg. (2.3) Maintenance doses: Guided by response to prior dose, not administered until recovery is evident. (2.4) Continuous infusion: Initial rate of 10 to 12 mcg/kg/min. Start only after early evidence of spontaneous recovery from an intubating dose. (2.5) 2.1 Important Dosing and Administration Information Rocuronium bromide is for intravenous use only. This drug should only be administered by experienced clinicians or trained individuals supervised by an experienced clinician familiar with the use, actions, characteristics, and complications of neuromuscular blocking agents. Doses of rocuronium bromide injection should be individualized and a peripheral nerve stimulator should be used to monitor drug effect, need for additional doses, adequacy of spontaneous recovery or antagonism, and to decrease the complications of overdosage if additional doses are administered. The dosage information which follows is derived from studies based upon units of drug per unit of body weight. It is intended to serve as an initial guide to clinicians familiar with other neuromuscular blocking agents to acquire experience with rocuronium bromide. In patients in whom potentiation of, or resistance to, neuromuscular block is anticipated, a dose adjustment should be considered [see Dosage and Administration (2."

VARITHENA is intended for intravenous injection using ultrasound guidance, administered via a single cannula into the lumen of the target incompetent trunk veins or by direct injection into varicosities. Use up to 5 mL per injection and no more than 15 mL per session. Physicians administering VARITHENA must be experienced with venous procedures and be trained in the administration of VARITHENA. Activate VARITHENA using the VARITHENA oxygen canister and polidocanol canister (see Instructions for Use). Once a VARITHENA transfer unit is in place, foam can be generated and transferred to a syringe. Discard the syringe contents if there are any visible bubbles. Administer the injectable foam within 75 seconds of extraction from the canister to maintain injectable foam properties. Use a new sterile syringe after each injection. Use a new VARITHENA transfer unit for each treatment session. Local anesthetic may be administered prior to cannula insertion but neither tumescent anesthesia nor patient sedation is required. Cannulate the vein to be treated using ultrasound guidance to confirm venous access. Inject freshly generated VARITHENA injectable foam slowly (approximately 1 mL/second in the GSV and 0.5 mL/second in accessory veins or varicosities) while monitoring using ultrasound. Confirm venospasm of the treated vein using ultrasound. When treating the proximal GSV, stop the injection when VARITHENA is 3-5 cm distal to the saphenofemoral junction (SFJ). Apply compression bandaging and stockings and have the patient walk for at least 10 minutes, while being monitored. Maintain compression for 2 weeks after treatment. Repeat treatment may be necessary if the size and extent of the veins to be treated require more than 15 mL of VARITHENA. Separate treatment sessions by a minimum of 5 days. Retained coagulum may be removed by aspiration (microthrombectomy) to improve comfort and reduce skin staining. Incompetent great sa"

(2.3) 2.1 Adults and Adolescents Weighing ≥30 kg The recommended oral dose of COMBIVIR in HIV-1-infected adults and adolescents weighing greater than or equal to 30 kg is 1 tablet (containing 150 mg of lamivudine and 300 mg of zidovudine) twice daily. 2.2 Pediatric Patients The recommended oral dosage of scored COMBIVIR Tablets for pediatric patients who weigh greater than or equal to 30 kg and for whom a solid oral dosage form is appropriate is 1 tablet administered twice daily. Before prescribing COMBIVIR Tablets, children should be assessed for the ability to swallow tablets. If a child is unable to reliably swallow a COMBIVIR tablet, the liquid oral formulations should be prescribed: EPIVIR® (lamivudine) Oral Solution and RETROVIR® (zidovudine) Syrup. 2.3 Patients Requiring Dosage Adjustment Because COMBIVIR is a fixed-dose combination tablet, it should not be prescribed for pediatric patients weighing less than 30 kg or patients requiring dosage adjustment, such as those with reduced renal function (creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/min), patients with hepatic impairment, or patients experiencing dose-limiting adverse reactions. Liquid and solid oral formulations of the individual components of COMBIVIR are available for these populations."

    "package_label": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Vecuronium bromide for injection is for intravenous use only.This drug should be administered by or under the supervision of experienced clinicians familiar with the use of neuromuscular blocking agents. Dosage must be individualized in each case. The dosage information which follows is derived from studies based upon units of drug per unit of body weight and is intended to serve as a guide only, especially regarding enhancement of neuromuscular blockade of vecuronium by volatile anesthetics and by prior use of succinylcholine (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.To obtain maximum clinical benefits of vecuronium and to minimize the possibility of overdosage, the monitoring of muscle twitch response to peripheral nerve stimulation is advised.The recommended initial dose of vecuronium bromide is 0.08 to 0.10 mg/kg (1.4 to 1.75 times the ED90) given as an intravenous bolus injection. This dose can be expected to produce good or excellent non-emergency intubation conditions in 2.5 to 3 minutes after injection. Under balanced anesthesia, clinically required neuromuscular blockade lasts approximately 25-30 minutes, with recovery to 25% of control achieved approximately 25 to 40 minutes after injection and recovery to 95% of control achieved approximately 45-65 minutes after injection. In the presence of potent inhalation anesthetics, the neuromuscular blocking effect of vecuronium is enhanced. If vecuronium is first administered more than 5 minutes after the start of inhalation agent or when steady state has been achieved, the initial vecuronium bromide dose may be reduced by approximately 15%, i.e., 0.060 to 0.085 mg/kg.Prior administration of succinylcholine may enhance the neuromuscular blocking effect and duration of action of vecuronium. If intubation is performed using succinylcholine"

Treatment of Alcoholism A dose of 50 mg once daily is recommended for most patients (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Trials, Individualization of Dosage). The placebo-controlled studies that demonstrated the efficacy of naltrexone as an adjunctive treatment of alcoholism used a dose regimen of naltrexone 50 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks. Other dose regimens or durations of therapy were not evaluated in these trials. A patient is a candidate for treatment with naltrexone if: the patient is willing to take a medicine to help with alcohol dependence the patient is opioid free for 7 to 10 days the patient does not have severe or active liver or kidney problems. (Typical guidelines suggest liver function tests no greater than 3 times the upper limits of normal, and bilirubin normal.) the patient is not allergic to naltrexone, and no other contraindications are present Refer to CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS sections for additional information. Naltrexone should be considered as only one of many factors determining the success of treatment of alcoholism. Factors associated with a good outcome in the clinical trials with naltrexone were the type, intensity, and duration of treatment; appropriate management of comorbid conditions; use of community-based support groups; and good medication compliance. To achieve the best possible treatment outcome, appropriate compliance-enhancing techniques should be implemented for all components of the treatment program, especially medication compliance. Treatment of Opioid Dependence Initiate treatment with Naltrexone using the following guidelines Treatment should not be attempted unless the patient has remained opioid-free for at least 7 to 10 days. Self-reporting of abstinence from opioids in opioid addicts should be verif"

    "package_label": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION TABLOID brand Thioguanine is administered orally. The dosage which will be tolerated and effective varies according to the stage and type of neoplastic process being treated. Because the usual therapies for adult and pediatric acute nonlymphocytic leukemias involve the use of thioguanine with other agents in combination, physicians responsible for administering these therapies should be experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapy and in the chosen protocol. Patients with homozygous deficiency of either TPMT or NUDT15 enzyme typically require 10% or less of the standard thioguanine dosage. Reduce initial dosage in patients who are known to have homozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency. Most of the patients with heterozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency tolerate recommended thioguanine doses, but some require dose reduction based on toxicities. Patients who are heterozygous for both TPMT and NUDT15 may require more substantial dosage reduction. Reduce the dosage based on tolerability. Ninety-six (59%) of 163 pediatric patients with previously untreated acute nonlymphocytic leukemia obtained complete remission with a multiple-drug protocol including thioguanine, prednisone, cytarabine, cyclophosphamide, and vincristine. Remission was maintained with daily thioguanine, 4-day pulses of cytarabine and cyclophosphamide, and a single dose of vincristine every 28 days. The median duration of remission was 11.5 months. Fifty-three percent of previously untreated adults with acute nonlymphocytic leukemias attained remission following use of the combination of thioguanine and cytarabine according to a protocol developed at The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. A median duration of remission of 8.8 months was achieved with the multiple-drug maintenance regimen which included thioguanine. On those occasions when single-agent chemotherapy with thioguanine may be appropriate, the usual initial dosage for pediatric patients and adults is approximately 2 mg"

If tablets are crushed or chewed, their extended-release properties will be lost.The dosage of quinidine varies considerably depending upon the general condition and the cardiovascular state of the patient. Conversion of Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter to Sinus Rhythm Especially in patients with known structural heart disease or other risk factors for toxicity, initiation or dose-adjustment of treatment with quinidine gluconate should generally be performed in a setting where facilities and personnel for monitoring and resuscitation are continuously available. Patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation/flutter should be treated with quinidine gluconate only after ventricular rate control (e.g., with digitalis or ß-blockers) has failed to provide satisfactory control of symptoms.Adequate trials have not identified an optimal regimen of quinidine gluconate for conversion of atrial fibrillation/flutter to sinus rhythm. In one reported regimen, the patient first receives two tablets (648 mg; 403 mg of quinidine base) of quinidine gluconate every eight hours. If this regimen has not resulted in conversion after 3 or 4 doses, then the dose is cautiously increased. If, at any point during administration, the QRS complex widens to 130% of its pre-treatment duration; the QTc interval widens to 130% of its pre-treatment duration and is then longer than 500 ms; P waves disappear; or the patient develops significant tachycardia, symptomatic bradycardia, or hypotension, then quinidine gluconate is discontinued, and other means of conversion (e.g., direct-current cardioversion) are considered.In another regimen sometimes used, the patient receives one tablet (324 mg; 202 mg of quinidine base) every eight hours for two days; then two tablets every twelve hours for two days; and finally two tablets every eight hours for up to four da"

Use only the accompanying diluent or Bacteriostatic Water For Injection with Benzyl Alcohol when reconstituting SOLU-MEDROL (see DESCRIPTION ). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. This preparation may be administered by intravenous injection, by intravenous infusion, or by intramuscular injection, the preferred method for initial emergency use being intravenous injection. Following the initial emergency period, consideration should be given to employing a longer acting injectable preparation or an oral preparation. There are reports of cardiac arrhythmias and/or cardiac arrest following the rapid administration of large intravenous doses of SOLU-MEDROL (greater than 0.5 gram administered over a period of less than 10 minutes). Bradycardia has been reported during or after the administration of large doses of methylprednisolone sodium succinate, and may be unrelated to the speed or duration of infusion. When high dose therapy is desired, the recommended dose of SOLU-MEDROL Sterile Powder is 30 mg/kg administered intravenously over at least 30 minutes. This dose may be repeated every 4 to 6 hours for 48 hours. In general, high dose corticosteroid therapy should be continued only until the patient's condition has stabilized; usually not beyond 48 to 72 hours. In other indications, initial dosage will vary from 10 to 40 mg of methylprednisolone depending on the specific disease entity being treated. However, in certain overwhelming, acute, life-threatening situations, administrations in dosages exceeding the usual dosages may be justified and may be in multiples of the oral dosages. It Sho"

A test dose immediately preceding the first dose is advisable when commencing all new courses of treatment. A small amount of drug (e.g., 10 mL of the final preparation containing between 1.6 to 8.3 mg) should be infused over 15 to 30 minutes and the patient carefully observed for the next 30 minutes. The infusion time may be shortened to a minimum of 2 hours for patients who show no evidence of intolerance or infusion-related reactions. If the patient experiences acute reactions or cannot tolerate the infusion volume, the infusion time may be extended. Directions for reconstitution and preparation of infusion admixture AMPHOTEC must be reconstituted by addition of Sterile Water for Injection. Using sterile syringe and a 20-gauge needle, rapidly add the following volumes to the vial to provide a liquid containing 5 mg of amphotericin B per mL.

The dose should not exceed once daily since it has been shown that more frequent administration of prostaglandin analogs may lessen the intraocular pressure lowering effect. Reduction of the intraocular pressure starts approximately 2 to 4 hours after the first administration with the maximum effect reached after 12 hours. ZIOPTAN® may be used concomitantly with other topical ophthalmic drug products to lower intraocular pressure. If more than one topical ophthalmic product is being used, each one should be administered at least 5 minutes apart. The solution from one individual unit is to be used immediately after opening for administration to one or both eyes. Since sterility cannot be maintained after the individual unit is opened, the remaining contents should be discarded immediately after administration.

All healthcare professionals should receive instruction and training prior to performing insertion and/or removal of NEXPLANON. A single NEXPLANON implant is inserted subdermally just under the skin at the inner side of the non-dominant upper arm. The insertion site is overlying the triceps muscle about 8-10 cm (3-4 inches) from the medial epicondyle of the humerus and 3-5 cm (1.25-2 inches) posterior to (below) the sulcus (groove) between the biceps and triceps muscles. This location is intended to avoid the large blood vessels and nerves lying within and surrounding the sulcus (see Figures 2a, 2b and 2c). Inserting an implant more deeply than subdermally (a deep insertion) may preclude palpation and localization, making removal difficult or impossible [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. NEXPLANON must be inserted by the expiration date stated on the packaging. NEXPLANON is a long-acting (up to 3 years), reversible, hormonal contraceptive method. The implant must be removed by the end of the third year and may be replaced by a new implant at the time of removal, if continued contraceptive protection is desired. Insert one NEXPLANON subdermally just under the skin at the inner side of the non-dominant upper arm. NEXPLANON must be removed no later than by the end of the third year. (2) 2.1 Initiating Contraception with NEXPLANON IMPORTANT: Rule out pregnancy before inserting the implant. Timing of insertion depends on the woman's recent contraceptive history, as follows: • No preceding hormonal contraceptive use in the past month NEXPLANON should be inserted between Day 1 (first day of menstrual bleeding) and Day 5 of the menstrual cycle, even if the woman is still bleeding. If inserted as recommended, back-up contraception is not necessary. If deviating from the recommended timing of insertion, the woman should be a"

(2.3, 8.6) • Hepatic Impairment: Use the lowest recommended starting dose. (2.3, 8.7) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended starting dosage of mercaptopurine tablets is 1.5 mg/kg to 2.5 mg/kg orally once daily as part of combination chemotherapy maintenance regimen. A recommended dosage for patients less than 17 kg is not achievable, because the only available strength is 50 mg. Take mercaptopurine tablets either consistently with or without food. After initiating mercaptopurine tablets, monitor complete blood count (CBC) and adjust the dose to maintain absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at a desirable level and for excessive myelosuppression. Evaluate the bone marrow in patients with prolonged myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression to assess leukemia status and marrow cellularity. Evaluate thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) and nucleotide diphosphatase (NUDT15) status in patients with severe myelosuppression or repeated episodes or myelosuppression [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Do not administer to patients who are unable to swallow tablets. If a patient misses a dose, instruct the patient to continue with the next scheduled dose. Mercaptopurine tablets are a cytotoxic drug. Follow special handling and disposal procedures. 2.2 Dosage Modifications in Patients with TPMT and NUDT15 Deficiency Consider testing for TPMT and NUDT15 deficiency in patients who experience severe myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].

Consider hydration with both oral fluids (30 mL per kg at least 48 hours before Cycle 1, Day 1) and intravenous fluids (250 mL to 500 mL of appropriate intravenous fluid prior to each dose in Cycle 1). If needed, give an additional 250 mL to 500 mL of intravenous fluids following Kyprolis administration. Continue oral and/or intravenous hydration, as needed, in subsequent cycles. Monitor patients for evidence of volume overload and adjust hydration to individual patient needs, especially in patients with or at risk for cardiac failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3)]. Electrolyte Monitoring Monitor serum potassium levels regularly during treatment with Kyprolis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Premedications and Concomitant Medications Premedicate with the recommended dose of dexamethasone for monotherapy or dexamethasone administered as part of the combination therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]."

Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS ). After observing the response to initial therapy with ibuprofen suspension, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs. PEDIATRIC PATIENTS Fever reduction For reduction of fever in children, 6 months up to 2 years of age, the dosage should be adjusted on the basis of the initial temperature level (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). The recommended dose is 5 mg/kg if the baseline temperature is less than 102.5°F, or 10 mg/kg if the baseline temperature is 102.5°F or greater. The duration of fever reduction is generally 6 to 8 hours. The recommended maximum daily dose is 40 mg/kg. Analgesia For relief of mild to moderate pain in children 6 months up to 2 years of age, the recommended dosage is 10 mg/kg, every 6 to 8 hours. The recommended maximum daily dose is 40 mg/kg. Doses should be given so as not to disturb the child's sleep pattern. Juvenile Arthritis The recommended dose is 30 to 40 mg/kg/day divided into three to four doses (see Individualization of Dosage). Patients with milder disease may be adequately treated with 20 mg/kg/day. In patients with juvenile arthritis, doses above 50 mg/kg/day are not recommended because they have not been studied and doses exceeding the upper recommended dose of 40 mg/kg/day may increase the risk of causing serious adverse events. The therapeutic response may require from a few days to several weeks to be achieved. Once a clinical effect is obtained, the dosage should be lowered to the smallest dose of ibuprofen needed to maintain adequate control of symptoms. Pediatric patients receiving doses above 30 mg/kg/day or if abnormal liver function tests have occurred with previous NSAID treatments should be car"

Concomitant administration of food does not adversely affect the absorption of clindamycin palmitate HCl contained in CLEOCIN PEDIATRIC Flavored Granules. Serious infections: 8–12 mg/kg/day (4–6 mg/lb/day) divided into 3 or 4 equal doses. Severe infections: 13–16 mg/kg/day (6.5–8 mg/lb/day) divided into 3 or 4 equal doses. More severe infections: 17–25 mg/kg/day (8.5–12.5 mg/lb/day) divided into 3 or 4 equal doses. In pediatric patients weighing 10 kg or less, ½ teaspoon (37.5 mg) three times a day should be considered the minimum recommended dose. Serious infections due to anaerobic bacteria are usually treated with CLEOCIN PHOSPHATE® Sterile Solution. However, in clinically appropriate circumstances, the physician may elect to initiate treatment or continue treatment with CLEOCIN PEDIATRIC. NOTE: In cases of β-hemolytic streptococcal infections, treatment should be continued for at least 10 days. Reconstitution Instructions: When reconstituted with water as follows, each 5 mL (teaspoon) of solution contains clindamycin palmitate HCl equivalent to 75 mg clindamycin. Reconstitute bottles of 100 mL with 75 mL of water. Add a large portion of the water and shake vigorously; add the remainder of the water and shake until the solution is uniform. Storage Conditions: Store at controlled room temperature 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) [see USP]. Do NOT refrigerate the reconstituted solution; when chilled, the solution may thicken and be difficult to pour. The solution is stable for 2 weeks at room temperature."

    "package_label": "Dosage and Administration Gentamicin Sulfate Injection, USP may be given intramuscularly or by intravenous infusion. The patient's pretreatment body weight should be obtained for calculation of correct dosage. The dosage of aminoglycosides in obese patients should be based on an estimate of the lean body mass. It is desirable to limit the duration of treatment with aminoglycosides to short term. Patients with Normal Renal Function Adults: The recommended dosage of gentamicin sulfate for patients with serious infections and normal renal function is 3 mg/kg/day, administered in three equal doses every eight hours (Table 1). For patients with life-threatening infections, dosages up to 5 mg/kg/day may be administered in three or four equal doses. The dosage should be reduced to 3 mg/kg/day as soon as clinically indicated (Table 1). It is desirable to measure both peak and trough serum concentrations of gentamicin to determine the adequacy and safety of the dosage. When such measurements are feasible, they should be carried out periodically during therapy to assure adequate but not excessive drug levels. For example, the peak concentration (at 30 to 60 minutes after intramuscular injection) is expected to be in the range of 4 to 6 mcg/mL. When monitoring peak concentrations after intramuscular or intravenous administration, dosage should be adjusted so that prolonged levels above 12 mcg/mL are avoided. When monitoring trough concentrations (just prior to the next dose), dosage should be adjusted so that levels above 2 mcg/mL are avoided. Determination of the adequacy of a serum level for a particular patient must take into consideration the susceptibility of the causative organism, the severity of the infection, and the status of the patient's host-defense mechanisms. In patients with extensive burns, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. In such patients treated with gentamicin, measurement of serum concentrations is rec"
