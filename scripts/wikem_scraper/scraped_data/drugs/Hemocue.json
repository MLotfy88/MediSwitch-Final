    "Mechanism": {
      "text": "The Hemocue device uses a method first described in 1960’s: modified azide-methemoglobin reaction.\nSodium deoxycholate hemolyses erythrocytes and hemoglobin is released.\nSodium nitrite converts hemoglobin to methemoglobin which, together with sodium azide, gives azidemethemoglobin\nThe absorbance is measured at two wavelengths (570 nm and 880 nm) in order to compensate for turbidity in the sample.",
