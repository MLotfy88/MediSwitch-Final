    "indications": "The following are contraindications to pentoxifylline:\n\nPatients with recent retinal or cerebral hemorrhage\nAllergy to xanthine derivatives, eg, caffeine, theophylline, theobromine\n[43]\n\nPrecautions\n\nAcute myocardial infarction or severe coronary disease due to increased risk of myocardial demand\nSevere liver disease (Child-Pugh class C) or cirrhosis\nAnaphylaxis due to pentoxifylline has been reported. Do not administer pentoxifylline in patients with a history of anaphylaxis.\n[44]\nPatients receiving pentoxifylline, particularly those with a history of peptic ulceration, recent surgery, or at risk of bleeding, especially in individuals with chronic kidney disease, should undergo regular assessments for signs of bleeding, including monitoring hematocrit and hemoglobin levels.\n[40]",
    "mechanism": "Pentoxifylline and the metabolites decrease blood viscosity and improve blood flow and peripheral tissue oxygenation. The precise mechanism of action that leads to symptom improvement remains yet to be determined. However, several pathways are likely involved.\n\nPentoxifylline increases red blood cell flexibility by increasing erythrocyte ATP and cyclic nucleotide levels. This reduces blood viscosity by decreasing erythrocyte aggregation and stimulating fibrinolysis to reduce plasma fibrinogen concentrations. All these effects enhance the ability of blood to flow through peripheral vessels (hemorheological action).\n\nPentoxifylline is a PDEi. By blocking the membrane-bound phosphodiesterase, pentoxifylline increases the concentration of cyclic AMP. The drug also inhibits thromboxane synthesis and increases prostacyclin synthesis. These actions result in reduced platelet aggregation. Further, pentoxifylline has demonstrated decreased adhesion of platelets to the vessel wall in patients with circulatory disorders.\n[12]\n\nPentoxifylline exerts vasodilation in the skeletal muscle vascular bed by inhibiting PDE and increasing the cAMP.\n[13]\n\nPentoxifylline inhibits the leukocyte-derived free radicals generated during peripheral ischemia in patients with peripheral vascular disease. This has been shown to reduce the impairment of the filterability rate of unfractionated leucocytes, limiting ischemia-related tissue damage.\n[14]\n\nPentoxifylline has immunomodulatory effects. The drug improves leukocyte deformability and chemotaxis, leading to depressed neutrophil degranulation, decreased endothelial leukocyte adhesion, and lowered sensitivity of leukocytes to cytokines. Pentoxifylline can inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines.\n[15]\n\nSeveral animal studies have demonstrated the role of pentoxifylline in attenuating ischemia-reperfusion injury, drug-induced nephrotoxicity, infection, and inflammation.\n\nPentoxifylline minimized the ischemia-related tissue damage to the intestinal mucosa during reperfusion in Wistar rats.\n[16]\n\nTreatment with pentoxifylline attenuated methotrexate-induced renal tissue injury cell death and suppressed the elevation of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels in Wistar rats.\n[17]\n\nPentoxifylline exerts a beneficial, gastroprotective effect against stress-induced gastric lesions by improving gastric microcirculation in Wistar rats. This effect is likely due to the enhanced nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity, local action of the nitric oxide, and attenuation of oxidative metabolism and proinflammatory cytokines.\n[18]\n\nIn a murine macrophage cell line model, pentoxifylline reduced TNF protein levels by inhibiting TNF mRNA transcription in response to bacterial infection.\n[19]\n\nPentoxifylline minimized liver damage induced by ischemia-reperfusion in albino rats.\n[20]\n\nMultiple clinical studies have demonstrated the role of pentoxifylline's anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and hemorheological properties in various disease states.\n\nIn a prospective randomized study, pentoxifylline demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in hemolysis during cardiopulmonary bypass compared to the control sample of patients.\n[21]\n\nIn a prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial of coronary artery bypass graft candidates with an ejection fraction lower or equal to 30%, pretreatment with pentoxifylline for 3 days before the procedure was associated with reduced tumor necrosis factor-α level, interleukin-6 level, improved left ventricular ejection fraction, decreased intensive care unit stay, ventilation time, and need for inotropic agents and blood transfusion.\n[22]\n\nIn patients with type-2 diabetic nephropathy on ACEi or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for more than 6 months and on conventional treatment, the addition of pentoxifylline therapy reduced proteinuria and improved glucose control and insulin resistance without a significant change of serum TNF-α in patients.\n[23]\n\nOral administration of pentoxifylline can improve cerebral blood flow in patients with cerebrovascular disease.\n[24]\n\nIn a double-blind placebo-controlled trial, administering pentoxifylline to patients with multi-infarct dementia showed intellectual and cognitive function improvements.\n[25]\n\nPharmacokinetics\n\nAbsorption:\nPentoxifylline is rapidly and completely absorbed in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract after oral administration. The drug is usually recommended with meals (food or milk) to minimize GI irritation. It is usually a sustained-release tablet with an early peak plasma pentoxifylline concentration 2 to 3 hours postadministration.\n\nBioavailability:\n20% to 30%, because of a high first-pass clearance.\n[26]\n[27]\n\nMetabolism:\nErythrocytes and the liver extensively metabolize pentoxifylline to its active metabolites (M1).\n[28]\n\nExcretion:\nPentoxifylline and its metabolites are primarily eliminated by the kidneys and less than 5% by feces. On the other hand, its key metabolites are also secreted in breast milk. The half-life of pentoxifylline is about 0.4 to 0.8 hours, and the metabolites are about 1 to 1.5 hours.",
    "administration": "Available Dosage Forms and Strengths\n\nGeneric name: Pentoxifylline\n\nChemical name: 3,7-dihydro-3,7-dimethyl-1-(5-oxohexyl)-1H-purine-2,6-dione.\n\nSolubility: Pentoxifylline is soluble in chloroform, methanol, and water.\n\nDosage form: Pentoxifylline is available as a 400 mg extended-release oral tablet.\n\nAdult Dosing\n\nIntermittent claudication: 400 mg orally 3 times per day with meals. Reduce the dose to 400 mg twice daily if GI intolerance is observed.\n[2]\n[28]\n\nOff-Label Indications\n\nSevere alcoholic hepatitis: 400 mg orally 3 times daily for 4 weeks.\n[29]\n\nVenous leg ulcer: 400 mg orally 3 times daily.\n[30]\n[7]\n\nTreatment of neuropathic pain secondary to diabetic neuropathy: 400 mg orally 3 times daily after meal.\n[31]\n\nTreatment of Kawasaki disease: The recommended dosage is 20 mg/kg/day to reduce the prevalence of coronary artery lesions.\n[32]\n[33]\n\nPentoxifylline has been used in isolated case reports for specific indications. In Behcet syndrome-related ocular disease, a 2-week regimen of 600 mg per oral has been used. For prophylaxis against acute claudication in sickle cell disease, a dosage of 400 mg per oral 3 times daily after meals has been suggested. Further research is needed to validate its efficacy and safety in these contexts.\n[34]\n[35]\n\nSpecific Patient Population\n\nHepatic impairment:\nPentoxifylline should be used with caution in mild to moderate liver impairment as it may cause an increase in the exposure of pentoxifylline and its active metabolite. The use of pentoxifylline should be avoided in severe hepatic impairment.\n\nRenal impairment:\nIn patients with renal impairment and creatinine clearance (CrCl) below 30 mL/min, the dose of pentoxifylline should be reduced to 400 mg/day.\n\nPregnancy considerations:\nPentoxifylline crosses the placenta in mice; evidence in humans is lacking. Therefore, it is not recommended for pregnant women unless the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nBreastfeeding considerations:\nCaution is advised when administering pentoxifylline to breastfeeding mothers, as pentoxifylline and its metabolites can be secreted in milk. Although evidence indicates that the drug is generally safe for breastfed infants, particularly those older than 2 months, it is advised to carefully consider whether to continue nursing or cease the medication, weighing the drug's significance for the mother.\n[36]\n\nPediatric patients:\nPentoxifylline in patients aged below 18 is not advised because its safety profile and efficacy have not yet been established.\n\nOlder patients:\nThe older patients exhibit higher peak plasma levels of the metabolites of pentoxifylline, leading to potential toxicity. Starting the pentoxifylline dosage at a lower level is recommended, considering polypharmacy and impaired renal/hepatic/cardiac function.",
    "adverse_effects": "The most common adverse effect of pentoxifylline is nausea and vomiting. Other common adverse drug reactions are listed below.\n\nGI system: Abdominal discomfort, bloating, and diarrhea\n\nCardiovascular system: Flushing; other infrequent side-effects are chest pain, arrhythmias, hypertension, dyspnea, tachycardia, and hypotension.\n\nCentral nervous system: Dizziness, headache\n[5]\n\nDrug-Drug Interactions\n\nAntihypertensive agents:\nPentoxifylline has been used with antihypertensive drugs, including beta blockers and diuretics. Some patients treated with pentoxifylline and nifedipine or captopril have shown slight reductions in blood pressure.\n[37]\n[38]\nPeriodic monitoring of systemic blood pressure in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy with pentoxifylline is recommended. If necessary, consider adjusting the dosage of the antihypertensive agents.\n\nOral hypoglycemic drugs:\nIn animal studies, pentoxifylline enhances the anti-glycemic action of antidiabetic agents such as glibenclamide or metformin. Pentoxifylline has been demonstrated to inhibit ATP-sensitive K channels similar to glyburide in diabetic rats.\n[39]\nA dose reduction of anti-glycemic agents and glucose monitoring is recommended.\n\nAntiplatelet drugs:\nPentoxifylline can increase the risk of bleeding in patients taking warfarin or antiplatelet agents. Monitoring PT/INR is recommended. The study has demonstrated that in patients with chronic kidney disease, the administration of pentoxifylline, particularly at daily doses exceeding 800 mg, requires monitoring for bleeding risk, especially in patients with a history of ischaemic stroke and regular aspirin use.\n[40]\n\nTheophylline:\nPentoxifylline increases the plasma levels of theophylline by decreasing the clearance of theophylline, necessitating therapeutic drug monitoring.\n[41]\n\nKetolorac:\nAdministering ketorolac concurrently with pentoxifylline should be avoided due to increased bleeding risk.\n[42]",
    "monitoring": "Older patients are at higher risk of adverse effects from pentoxifylline. Careful monitoring of blood pressure and glucose levels is recommended when administering pentoxifylline to patients on antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications. They are at high risk for hypotension, falls, and hypoglycemia. Patients with liver disease should also undergo follow-up with periodic laboratory monitoring. Patients at increased risk of bleeding should be advised of potential signs and symptoms of bleeding and monitored with periodic laboratory data, including hematocrit and hemoglobin. Clinicians should exercise caution with cardiac arrhythmias and low blood pressure patients. Ankle-brachial index (ABI), pain-free walking distance, and maximum walking distance should be monitored for patients with peripheral arterial disease.\n[5]\n[45]",
    "toxicity": "Signs and Symptoms of Overdose\n\nReports of adverse effects of pentoxifylline are apparent in patients on chronic hemodialysis.\n[46]\nMetabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, and arrhythmias are the primary symptoms of pentoxifylline overdose. Additionally, oliguria, cardiovascular collapse, and altered consciousness, including delirium, agitation, and coma, have been reported.\n\nManagement of Overdose\n\nNo reported antidote is available for this medication. The prescriber should discontinue the drug in suspected cases of toxicity. The symptomatic treatment includes administering IV fluids, NaHCO\n3\nsupplementation, and norepinephrine infusion. In cases of significant overdose, consideration should be given to gastric lavage. Extracorporeal elimination is not currently recommended; however, it may be a viable option for patients with severe metabolic acidosis or impaired kidney function.\n[47]\n[48]"
