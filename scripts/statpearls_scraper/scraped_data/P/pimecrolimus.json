    "indications": "Absolute Contraindication\n[18]\n\nHistory of hypersensitivity to pimecrolimus or any other ingredients included in the cream formulation\n\nWhen Pimecrolimus Cream Should be Avoided\n\nPatients who are immunocompromised or are taking systemic immunosuppressive medications\nAreas of skin with active pre-malignant or malignant lesions (such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL)) or skin infections (bacterial or viral)\nPatients who have severely impaired skin barrier function that may be at higher risk for increased systemic absorption (i.e., Netherton syndrome)",
    "mechanism": "Activation of T-lymphocytes starts with the interaction of costimulatory ligands on antigen-presenting cells and T-cell receptors. Intracellular free calcium increases and binds to calmodulin, which activates calcineurin (a protein phosphatase). Calcineurin dephosphorylates the cytoplasmic portion of the transcription factor called nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), which is then transported to the nucleus and contributes to the transcription of several inflammatory cytokines.\n\nTCIs, by definition, inhibit calcineurin. Pimecrolimus achieves this as it binds to the FK506-binding protein (FKBP) and blocks calcineurin’s ability to dephosphorylate NFAT, effectively halting calcineurin-dependent transcription of genes for T-cell activation and production of cytokines such as interleukins 2, 4, and 10 as well as interferon-gamma.",
    "administration": "Pimecrolimus is obtained by prescription in a 1% concentration within a cream vehicle; each gram cream contains 10mg of pimecrolimus. Other ingredients that can be included in the cream base are benzyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, oleyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, citric acid, propylene glycol, sodium cetostearyl sulfate, sodium hydroxide, water as well as mono-, di-, and triglycerides. The drug comes in tubes containing 30, 60, or 100 grams.\n\nPimecrolimus may be used in combination with steroids, as part of an alternating dosing regimen as a steroid-sparing agent, or as monotherapy. The use of topical calcineurin inhibitors 2 to 3 times per week has been shown to proactively reduce flares of atopic dermatitis, and the frequency of use of topical steroids and is more effective than using a bland emollient by itself.\n[1]\nA thin layer of pimecrolimus cream is to be applied only to the affected skin twice daily for no longer than 6 weeks continuously. If dermatitis does not respond within that time frame, the patient should seek re-evaluation. Pimecrolimus should not be used under occlusive dressings as its safety has received adequate study under such conditions.",
    "adverse_effects": "The most common side effects of pimecrolimus cream are local sensations of burning, stinging, or pruritus; this may happen, especially when the site of the application is acutely inflamed. Generally, these side effects will improve with repetitive use or mitigated by using topical steroids before the initiation of pimecrolimus.\n\nSeveral other side effects have been reported with the use of topical pimecrolimus, although they are relatively uncommon or have not been proven to be a direct result of treatment. Atopic patients, in particular, are at a higher risk than the general population of certain bacterial and viral skin infections such as\nStaphylococcus aureus\ncolonization leading to impetigo or more widespread distribution of herpetic lesions called eczema herpeticum. The current prescribing instructions state to avoid use on active infections, and patients should have counseling on the possibility of skin infections due to limited long-term safety data.\n\nOther possible adverse effects include application site reaction (i.e., erythema or skin discoloration), headache, fever, flu-like symptoms, nasopharyngitis or nasal congestion, sinusitis, epistaxis, upper respiratory tract infection, sore throat, tonsillitis, cough, bronchitis, dyspnea, pneumonia, asthma or asthma exacerbation, folliculitis, acne, urticaria, constipation, diarrhea, gastroenteritis, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, toothache, dysmenorrhea, hypersensitivity, arthralgia, conjunctivitis, eye infection, ear infection, anaphylaxis, angioedema, lymphadenopathy, and malignancy (basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma, and lymphoma).\n[17]",
    "monitoring": "Calcineurin inhibitors applied topically have been shown to have negligible rates of systemic absorption. There is no recommendation for routine blood monitoring of patients using topical pimecrolimus.",
    "toxicity": "Topical pimecrolimus is rated category C as there have been no adequate studies in pregnant women.\n\nTCIs such as pimecrolimus have a black-box warning from theoretical risks based on high dose systemic calcineurin inhibitor use in post-transplant patients and animal studies.\n[19]\nThere is an increased risk of infections, lymphoma, and skin malignancies in those study populations that correlates positively with the dosage and duration of systemic immunosuppression. Although there has been no definite establishment of a causal relationship, skin malignancies and lymphomas have rarely been reported in patients using topical pimecrolimus. Patients or parents should be made aware of the black-box warning but reassured that the risk of malignancy is low when adhering to the proper use of topical calcineurin inhibitors.\n\nSome formulations of topical pimecrolimus contain benzyl alcohol and propylene glycol as inactive ingredients, which have been reported to cause serious adverse effects in neonates.\n[20]\nBenzyl alcohol toxicity has been known to cause “gasping syndrome” in neonate\ns\nwhen administered intravenously, and large amounts of propylene glycol administered orally, intravenously, or topically may also result in neonate fatality.\n[21]\nNo such reports stem directly from the use of benzyl alcohol or propylene glycol in topical pimecrolimus; in fact, data from clinical trials support the safe and effective use of pimecrolimus off-label in children less than 2 years of age and infants.\n[2]"
