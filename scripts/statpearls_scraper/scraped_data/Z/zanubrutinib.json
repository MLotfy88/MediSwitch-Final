    "indications": "Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare subtype of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) characterized by an (11,14) translocation resulting in overexpression of the cyclin D1 (\nCCND1)\ngene. The variety of morphologic variants may make this a challenging diagnosis, although some cases are uncomplicated. It typically follows an aggressive clinical course (aggressive MCL), although an indolent leukemia variant (indolent MCL) has been described.",
    "mechanism": "Mantle cell lymphoma is typically sporadic, but it may have a higher incidence in some families.",
    "monitoring": "Excisional biopsy of a lymph node or an involved extranodal site is essential in the diagnosis of MCL. Laboratory exams, including CBC with differential, LDH, and beta-2 microglobulin, bone marrow biopsy, and imaging (CT or FDG-PET/CT) are also recommended as the standard diagnostic workup. Further, the Ki-67 index and mutation status of p53, ATM, and CCND1 are also important in selecting the optimal treatment. A CSF study is also necessary to rule out CNS involvement and guide appropriate management in MCL patients with a high Ki-67 index (greater than 30%), blastoid variant, or neurologic symptoms.\n[8]\nThough GI tract involvement is common in MCL, the routine endoscopic evaluation is unnecessary for all cases since it does not affect the management. But GI workup is recommended in the suspected stage I and non-bulky stage II for appropriately staging early-stage MCL.\n\nImmunohistochemistry on pathology specimens plays an essential role in differentiating MCL from other NHL, including follicular lymphoma (FL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SLL/CLL). MCL is positive for B-cell markers (CD19, CD20, CD22, CD79a).  It is distinguished from other B-cell lymphomas by diffuse positivity for cyclin D1 and SOX11. SOX 11 is usually negative in indolent MCL. Rare cases are negative for cyclin D1 but can still be positive for SOX11. MCL is typically negative for BCL6, CD10, and CD23 (while CLL is CD23 positive). Rare cases of MCL are CD10 positive.\n[9]\nPeripheral blood flow cytometry can have CD 200 expression characteristic of MCL. Testing for P53 mutation is recommended to help in the prognostication of MCL.\n\nMIPI ( Mantle cell lymphoma international prognostic index) is a scoring system is used to stratify the risk of patients with MCL with pneumonic APLE to remember for readers.\n[10]\n\nAge\nPerformance status\nLDH\nElevated white blood count\n\nUsing these parameters, scoring calculators are available for free (online) that can help educate patients about their prognosis and expected survival based on these calculations of their survival. However, the MIPI scoring system falls short in predicting prognosis in all MCL patients. Therefore the addition of KI 67, cytogenetics, and TP 53 mutations can help improve the risk stratification of MCL.\n\nHigh-risk MIPI score patients have median Overall survival (OS ) of 2.8 yrs, while low-risk MIPI had survival longer than 5 years.\n[11]\n[12]\n\nTypically based on symptoms and presentation, patients can be divided into indolent MCL or aggressive MCL.\n\nTable\nTable. Title.",
    "administration": "MCL remains a largely incurable disease with a median overall survival (OS) ranging from 1.8 to 9.4 years, depending on whether it is aggressive or indolent MCL. The choice of optimal treatment usually has its basis in the aggressiveness of the disease, performance status, age, and mantle cell international prognostic index (MIPI) score since there is no curative standard treatment established for MCL.\n\nIndolent forms of MCL with low MIPI score, hypermutated IGH genes, SOX11 negativity, and non-complex karyotype may be monitored without immediate treatment. As such, watch and wait is appropriate in patients who have 1) Ki-67 = 30%, 2) maximum tumor diameter less than 3 cm, normal serum LDH level, 4) normal beta-2 microglobulin level, 5) no B symptoms, and 6) non-blastoid histology.\n[13]\n\nTable\n\nIt is rare to find early stage I or non-bulky stage II that can be treated by involved field radiation alone or with nonaggressive regimens used for transplant-ineligible patients.\n\nSymptomatic patients with classic MCL (aggressive MCL) that need treatments (Stage II bulky or stage III or stage IV can be classified as stem cell transplant eligible or nontransplant eligible based on performance status and comorbidities.\n\nTable\nAggressive chemo regimens used: RCHOP alternating with RDHAP; or NORDIC regimen ( Maxi RCHOP alternating with Rituximab and high dose Cytarabine or Hyper-CVAD that includes a CHOP-like regimen alternating with high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine\n\nR-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, prednisone), BR (bendamustine, rituximab), R-DHAP (rituximab, dexamethasone, cytarabine, cisplatin), hyper-CVAD (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone alternating with high dose methotrexate and high dose cytarabine)\n\nPatients with relapsed or refractory disease require more aggressive treatment, which is typically a salvage regimen followed by HDC and autologous or allogeneic SCT. Other second-line targeted agents with fewer side effects that are now FDA-approved include\n\nTable\nInhibit constitutively activated B cell receptor (BCR) signaling through inhibiting BTK downstream from BCR in mantle cell and also  immunomodulatory effects on T cells Acalubritinib and  zanubrutinib bind to cysteine 481 of BTK\n(more...)\n\nIbrutinib, acalabrutinib, zanubrutinib, venetoclax +/- rituximab, bortezomib +/- rituximab, lenalidomide plus rituximab, ibrutinib and lenalidomide + rituximab and chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR-T) received FDA approval and several other agents including BiTE antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates and are under clinical trials.\n\nBCR- B cell receptor, BTK - Bruton's tyrosine kinase",
    "adverse_effects": "Complications of the MCL due to the disease process itself based on the site of MCL involvement include splenic rupture due to splenomegaly, GI bleeding or obstruction or perforation due to MCL in the gastrointestinal tract, and tumor lysis in the blastoid variant of MCL are all the considerations.\n[34]\nDue to chemotherapy and stem cell transplants, complications of life-threatening infections, neutropenic sepsis, cytopenias needing transfusions, nausea, vomiting, and hair loss are possible. With targeted drug approvals in MCL with agents like ibrutinib, aBTK inhibitor, hypertension, arrhythmias, diarrhea, skin rashes, and bleeding risk are reported. These side effects are felt to be more related to off-target actions on EGFR, ITK, and PI3K. Second-generation BTK inhibitors like acalabrutinib and zanubrutinib are more specific to BTK and have fewer off-target side effects in terms of hypertension, arrhythmias, or rashes.\n[14]\nBCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax is now approved for MCL venetoclax drug tumor lysis syndrome, while lenalidomide edema, cytopenias, risk of blood clots, and diarrhea are expected complications and or side effects to be aware of. Brexucabtagene (CAR-T cell therapy ) is associated with encephalopathy, cytopenias, and pyrexia from cytokine release syndrome, which must be addressed during the treatments.\n\nITK - Interleukin-2-inducible T-cell kinase, EGFR-epidermal growth factor inhibitor, PI3K-phosphoinositide 3-kinase."
