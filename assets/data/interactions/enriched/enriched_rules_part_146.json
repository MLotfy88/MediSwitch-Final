Patients should be advised to seek immediate medical attention if they develop potential signs and symptoms of hypomagnesemia such as palpitations, arrhythmia, muscle spasm, tremor, or convulsions. In children, abnormal heart rates may cause fatigue, upset stomach, dizziness, and lightheadedness. Magnesium replacement as well as discontinuation of the PPI may be required in some patients.",

Individual product labeling for washout periods should be consulted for current recommendations.  If serotonin syndrome develops or is suspected during the course of therapy, all serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately and supportive care rendered as necessary.  Moderately ill patients may also benefit from the administration of a serotonin antagonist (e.g., cyproheptadine, chlorpromazine).  Severe cases should be managed under consultation with a toxicologist and may require sedation, neuromuscular paralysis, intubation, and mechanical ventilation in addition to the other measures.",
