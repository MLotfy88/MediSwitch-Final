    "indications": "Box Warnings\n\nPatients with hypersensitivity to memantine hydrochloride or any agents used in the formulation.\n[14]\n\nWarning and Precautions\n\nGenitourinary conditions:\nConditions that raise urine pH, like renal tubular acidosis, may decrease the urinary elimination of memantine.\n\nCardiovascular disease:\nIncreased incidence of cardiac failure, angina, and hypertension occurred in clinical trials.\n\nHepatic impairment:\nPrecaution use in severe hepatic impairment; effects of impairment on pharmacokinetics have not been established.\n[8]",
    "mechanism": "Memantine is an uncompetitive antagonist of the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptors in the CNS. Alzheimer disease is believed to be caused by overstimulation of glutamate, the primary excitatory amino acid in the CNS, resulting in excitotoxicity and neuronal degeneration. The NMDAR is a voltage-gated cation channel blocked by magnesium ions in the physiologic unstimulated state. Stimulated magnesium is displaced, allowing calcium influx and activation. In Alzheimer disease, pathologic overstimulation of the receptor causes a chronically active state. Memantine counteracts the excessive stimulation.\n[1]\n\nMemantine also exhibits antagonist activity at the serotonergic type 3 (5-HT3) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Memantine has no activity at the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), benzodiazepine, dopamine, adrenergic, histamine, or glycine receptors or for voltage-dependent calcium, sodium, or potassium channels.\n[1]\n\nPharmacokinetics\n\nMemantine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics behavior over the therapeutic dose range.\n\nAbsorption:\nThe Cmax and AUC0-24 values of memantine were 48% and 33% higher for the extended-release dosage regimen when comparing once daily 28 mg memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules to twice 10 mg daily memantine hydrochloride. Memantine peak plasma concentration occurs around 9 to 12 hours post-dose after multiple doses of memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules. Whether taken intact or sprinkled on applesauce, there is no difference in the absorption of memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules.\n\nWhether memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules are taken with food or on an empty stomach, there is no difference in the Cmax or AUC. However, peak plasma concentrations are achieved about 18 hours and 25 hours after administration with food and on an empty stomach, respectively.\n\nDistribution:\nThe plasma protein binding of memantine is 45%. The average volume of distribution of memantine is 9 to 11 L/kg.\n\nMetabolism:\nMemantine is partially metabolized in the liver. The hepatic microsomal enzyme system, specifically CYP450, does not significantly impact the breakdown of memantine.\n\nElimination:\nMost of the memantine is eliminated through urine without undergoing any changes. The elimination half-life is about 60 to 80 hours. Approximately 48% of the drug administered is eliminated unchanged in the urine. The remaining portion is transformed into 3 polar metabolites with minimal NMDAR antagonistic activity. These metabolites include the\nN\n-glucuronide conjugate, 6-hydroxy-memantine, and 1-nitroso-deaminated memantine. 74% of the administered dose is excreted as the sum of the parent drug and the\nN\n-glucuronide conjugate. Renal clearance involves active tubular secretion moderated by pH-dependent tubular reabsorption.",
    "administration": "Available Dosage Forms and Strengths\n\nDosing parameters\n\nStarting dosage: 5 mg once daily\nTarget dosage: 20 mg once daily\nTitration: Dosage increased by 5 mg daily in weekly intervals as tolerated\nTitration schedule\nWeek 1: 5 mg daily\nWeek 2: 10 mg daily (5 mg twice daily)\nWeek 3: 15 mg daily (5 mg one time and 10 mg one time daily)\nWeek 4: 20 mg daily (10 mg twice daily)\nSwitching from immediate-release (IR) to extended-release (ER): Start ER the day after the last dosage of IR; IR 10 mg twice daily should be switched to ER 28 mg daily.\n\nMissed dosage: If a single dose is missed, do not double up on the next dose; if several dosages are missed, resume at a lower dose and titrate as tolerated.\n\nAdult Dosage\n\nDosage forms:\n[3]\n\nCapsule, extended-release, 24-hour, oral, as hydrochloride - generic: 7 mg, 14 mg, 21 mg, 28 mg\n\nSolution, oral, as hydrochloride - generic: 2 mg/mL (360 mL)\n\nTablet, oral, as hydrochloride -generic: 5 mg, 10 mg\n\nAdministration:\n\nAny formulation: With or without food, do not chew, crush, or divide\n\nExtended-release capsules: The entire contents of the capsule may be swallowed and sprinkled on food and swallowed immediately.\n\nOral solution: Do not mix with any other liquid; administer with the provided dosing device supplied with a syringe, syringe adaptor cap, tubing, and other needed supplies; slowly squirt into the corner of the mouth.\n\nStorage:\n\nRoom temperature between 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F)\n\nSpecific Patient Populations\n\nHepatic impairment:\nPharmacokinetics of memantine was studied after administration of 20 mg single dose of memantine hydrochloride in 8 patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B score of 7 to 9), and 8 healthy volunteers matched as closely as possible by weight, age, and gender. Compared to healthy volunteers, there was no change in Cmax and AUC of memantine exposure in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. In subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, the terminal elimination half-life increased by approximately 16% compared to healthy volunteers.\n\nRenal impairment:\nPharmacokinetics of memantine was studied after administration of 20 mg single dose of memantine hydrochloride in 7 patients with severe renal impairment (5 to 29 mL/min creatinine clearance), 8 patients with moderate renal impairment (30 to 49 mL/min creatinine clearance), 8 patients with mild renal impairment (>50 to 80 mL/min creatinine clearance), and 8 healthy volunteers (>80 mL/min creatinine clearance) matched closely by weight, age, and gender. Compared to healthy subjects, average AUC increased by 115%, 60%, and 4% in subjects with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively. Similarly, the terminal elimination half-life increased by 95%, 41%, and 18% in subjects with severe, moderate, and mild renal impairment, respectively.\n[7]\n\nPregnant considerations:\nMemantine is considered a pregnancy category B drug.\nThere is insufficient data on using memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules and associated developmental risks in pregnant women. Some adverse developmental effects (decreased body weight and skeletal ossification) were observed in the offspring of rats when memantine was administered during pregnancy at doses associated with minimal maternal toxicity. Typically, these doses are higher than the maximum recommended daily dose in humans. The risk of major congenital abnormalities and miscarriage is unknown.\n\nBreastfeeding considerations:\nWhether the administered memantine is excreted in human milk, affects breastfed infants, or affects milk production is unknown. The recommendation is to consider the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding along with the clinical needs of the mother.\n\nPediatric patients:\nThe safety and effectiveness of memantine hydrochloride have not been established in pediatric patients.\n\nOlder patients:\nNo dose adjustment of memantine is needed as the pharmacokinetics in adults and older patients are similar.\n\nGender:\nAfter administering multiple doses of memantine hydrochloride 20 mg daily, female patients had about 45% higher exposure than males. However, there was no difference in exposure when body weight was considered.",
    "adverse_effects": "The most common adverse effects of memantine in clinical trials include dizziness, headache, confusion, diarrhea, and constipation.\n[8]\n[9]\nAdditional adverse effects include fatigue, pain, hypertension, weight gain, hallucination, confusion, aggressive behavior, vomiting, abdominal pain, and urinary incontinence.\n[10]\n\nUncommon (post-marketing surveillance, clinical trials, or case reports) adverse effects are listed below.\n\nNeurologic: abnormal gait, cerebral infarction, cerebrovascular accident, intracranial hemorrhage, seizure, somnolence, tardive dyskinesia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome\n\nCardiovascular: bradyarrhythmia, heart failure, myocardial infarction, peripheral edema, syncope, tachycardia\n\nEndocrine: weight change\n\nGastrointestinal: loss of appetite, nausea\n\nHematologic: anemia\n\nHepatic: hepatitis, liver failure\n[11]\n\nRenal: acute renal failure, urinary tract infection\n\nRespiratory: bronchitis, pneumonia, upper respiratory infection\n\nDermatologic: rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome\n\nMusculoskeletal: arthralgia\n\nOthers: falling injury, influenza-like symptoms, neuroleptic malignant syndrome\n\nDrug-Drug Interactions\n\nDrugs causing alkaline urine:\nAlkaline urine conditions with a pH of 8 can reduce the clearance of memantine by approximately 80%, leading to an accumulation of the drug and potentially increasing the risk of adverse effects. Hence, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and sodium bicarbonate should be used cautiously due to the risk of adverse effects.\n[12]\n\nNMDA antagonists:\nCombining memantine with other NMDA antagonists, including amantadine, ketamine, and dextromethorphan, can increase neuropsychiatric adverse effects. However, a recent study concluded that memantine can be administered with amantadine or dextromethorphan. Use with caution.\n[13]",
    "monitoring": "No routine monitoring is required for toxicity.\n\nMonitoring Efficacy: Memantine may take months for any noticeable improvement.\n\nActivities of daily living\n\nCognitive functioning improvements\n\nSlowing in the progression of decline in cognitive function and memory impairment\n\nClinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change Plus Caregiver Input (CIBIC-Plus)\n[15]",
    "toxicity": "Memantine overdose can result in several signs and symptoms. These may include agitation, asthenia, confusion, visual hallucinations, vertigo, coma, slowed movement, somnolence, dizziness, lethargy, loss of consciousness, ECG changes, bradycardia, increased blood pressure, psychosis, restlessness, stupor, unsteady gait, vomiting, and weakness. Clinicians must be aware of these potential effects when using memantine alone or in combination with other drugs and/or alcohol.\n[16]\n\nAccording to the literature, known adverse effects when co-ingested with antidiabetic drugs include coma, diplopia, and agitation—prolonged usage results in elevated levels of serum uric acid, serum alkaline phosphatase, and a low platelet count.\n\nThere are very few reports of fatal outcomes associated with memantine, and it is unclear if memantine was the cause. The recommendation is to contact a poison control center to stay updated on the latest overdose management strategies. General supportive measures are recommended, and treatment should address the symptoms. The elimination of memantine can be increased by acidifying urine."
