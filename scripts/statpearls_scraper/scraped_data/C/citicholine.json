    "toxicity": "Although NAION itself is a noninflammatory ischemic optic neuropathy, its management may involve pharmacological agents and systemic risk control therapies that can lead to adverse effects. Proper identification and mitigation of these adverse effects are crucial in a multidisciplinary approach.\n\nCorticosteroid-Related Toxicities\n\nCorticosteroids are often used off-label in selected early cases of NAION. However, their use requires careful consideration due to potential adverse effects.\n\nAdverse Effects:\nHyperglycemia\nHypertension\nImmunosuppression\nMood changes\nSteroid-induced glaucoma or cataract (ocular)\n\nManagement:\nUse the lowest effective dose for the shortest time\nMonitor blood glucose and blood pressure\nCoordinate care with endocrinology in patients with diabetes mellitus\nAvoid use in patients with uncontrolled systemic conditions\n[100]\n\nAntiplatelet (Aspirin) Therapy\n\nAdverse Effects:\nGastrointestinal irritation or bleeding\nIncreased bleeding risk, particularly in older patients\n\nManagement:\nUse enteric-coated formulations\nConsider gastroprotective agents, such as proton pump inhibitors\nMonitor regularly for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding\n[101]\n\nSystemic Risk Factor Management\n\nComprehensive management may include statins, antihypertensives, and hypoglycemics. Each class carries specific toxicity risks requiring tailored oversight.\n\nStatins toxicity:\nToxicity: Myopathy, liver enzyme elevation\nManagement: Monitor liver function tests; switch agent if needed\n\nAntihypertensive overcorrection:\nRisk: Nocturnal hypotension is a risk for the second eye NAION\nManagement: Avoid bedtime dosing; monitor blood pressure over 24 hours\n\nDiabetic medications:\nRisk: Hypoglycemia with tight control\nManagement: Titrate cautiously with ophthalmic input\n[102]\n\nContinuous Positive Airway Pressure in Sleep Apnea\n\nCPAP is often recommended to reduce recurrence in sleep apnea–related NAION.\n\nAdverse effects:\nDiscomfort, nasal congestion, and poor compliance\n\nManagement:\nNasal saline sprays or humidifiers\nReassurance and titration of pressure settings\nSleep specialist collaboration\n[103]\n\nIntravitreal Therapy (Experimental)\n\nIntravitreal therapy is used rarely or off-label; it includes anti-VEGF agents and steroids.\n\nRisks:\nEndophthalmitis\nIOP elevation\nRetinal detachment\n\nManagement:\nStrict asepsis during injection\nPost-injection monitoring\nTimely intervention for any complications\n\nPatient Education and Monitoring\n\nPatients should be educated on the potential adverse effects of systemic and ocular medications.\nPatients should be encouraged to promptly report symptoms, such as eye pain, visual loss, or systemic adverse reactions.\nRegular follow-up and interdisciplinary coordination—particularly with primary care physicians, endocrinologists, and sleep medicine specialists—are essential for safe and effective long-term management.\n[104]"
