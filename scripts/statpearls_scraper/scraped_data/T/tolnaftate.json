    "indications": "Tinea pedis, commonly known as athlete's foot, results from fungal infections on the skin of the feet\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\ncaused by dermatophytes, including\nTrichophyton rubrum\n,\nT mentagrophytes\n,\nT interdigitale\n, and\nEpidermophyton floccosum.\nThis infection typically occurs through direct contact with the organism while walking barefoot in locker rooms, showers, and swimming complexes.\n[4]\nIndividuals with diabetes and those who wear occlusive shoes are at an increased risk of developing tinea pedis.\n\nTinea pedis typically presents with pruritic scales and erosions between the toes. Some patients may experience areas of hyperkeratosis with underlying erythema on the medial and lateral aspects and soles of the feet. Occasionally, patients with this condition may present with painful bullous lesions concurrently develop tinea corporis, onychomycosis, and tinea manuum.\n\nUntreated tinea pedis can lead to cellulitis, pyoderma, and osteomyelitis, especially in patients with immunocompromised conditions, diabetes, or peripheral vascular disease. This topic explores the etiology and pathophysiology of tinea pedis, as well as highlights the critical roles of the interprofessional healthcare team in evaluating, managing, and preventing recurrence and complications of the condition.",
    "mechanism": "T rubrum\naccounts for approximately 70% of tinea pedis cases,\n[5]\n[6]\nwhereas\nT interdigitale\nand\nE floccosum\nare responsible for the remainder. Occasionally,\nTricholosporum violaceum\ncan also cause tinea pedis. The United States of America has seen a few cases of\nT indotineae\nrecently—a dermatophyte commonly found in India, Canada, and the Middle East. Notably,\nT indotineaee\nexhibits resistance to traditional antifungal treatments. Dermatophytes typically thrive in keratinized tissues such as hair, nails, and the outer layer of the skin.\n\nThe following factors contribute to the growth of dermatophytes:\n\nA hot and humid environment\nProlonged use of tightly fitting footwear\nExcessive sweating\nProlonged exposure to water",
    "monitoring": "Although the physical examination may strongly indicate a dermatophyte infection, tinea can overlap with other skin conditions. Confirmation through microscopy and culture may be necessary. A thorough skin examination is warranted as patients can experience dermatophyte infections in multiple body areas.\n\nMicroscopic examination of scrapings from the affected site can confirm the diagnosis by demonstrating segmented hyphae. A glass microscope slide should be used to scrape the foot's instep, heel, and sides to collect dry scales from the foot. Bullae should be unroofed, and either the entire roof or scrapings made from the underside of the roof should be mounted.\n\nTo perform the procedure, one should place a few drops of a 10% to 20% potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution on the glass slide, followed by a coverslip, and then observe the sample under the microscope. Adding 20% to 40% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) accelerates the clearing of keratin without requiring heating. A staining method that involves mixing 100 mg of chlorazol black E dye with 10 mL of DMSO and adding it to a 5% aqueous solution of KOH can be beneficial. Toluidine blue can also be applied to thin specimens at a concentration of 0.1%. Although mycelia may be visible at low power magnification, using the 10× objective on a microscope is advisable to observe both hyphae and spores better.\n[2]\n[9]\n[10]",
    "administration": "Improving hygiene in swimming pools and bathing areas and frequently washing and cleaning changing room floors and walkways may help control the spread of tinea pedis. Most patients can usually manage their condition effectively with topical treatment. Magenta paint or Castellani paint may be beneficial in certain cases of inflammatory tinea pedis, especially when a coexisting bacterial infection is present. Topical imidazoles such as clotrimazole, econazole, ketoconazole, miconazole, isoconazole, tioconazole, and sulconazole offer effective remedies with a very low incidence of adverse effects.\n\nTopical application of terbinafine and amorolfine yields faster results in treating tinea pedis than clotrimazole treatment. Moreover, adding a topical keratolytic, such as salicylic acid, can be beneficial in patients with hyperkeratosis. Using prophylactic tolnaftate powder after swimming and showering in community settings reduces the levels of toe cleft tinea pedis caused by\nT interdigitale\n. Generally, topical treatment lasts for 4 weeks, although some patients may experience symptom resolution sooner. Terbinafine 1% can provide effective results for interdigital tinea pedis after 1 week. Repeated KOH scrapings and cultures should yield negative results.\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n\nPatients who do not respond to topical treatment require systemic therapy.\n[12]\nAcceptable systemic treatment options include:\n\nTerbinafine at a daily dosage of 250 mg for 2 weeks.\n\nItraconazole at a twice-daily dosage of 200 mg for 1 week.\n\nFluconazole at 150 mg per week for 2 to 6 weeks.\n\nGriseofulvin, for adults, at a daily dosage of 1000 mg of griseofulvin microsize for 4 to 8 weeks or 750 mg of griseofulvin ultramicro size for 4 to 8 weeks. However, the latter option may be less effective than the other options.\n\nGriseofulvin, for children, at a recommended daily dosage of 10 to 20 mg/kg of griseofulvin microsize, 5 to 15 mg/kg of griseofulvin ultramicrosize, or itraconazole at 3 to 5 mg/kg.\n[14]\n[12]\n[15]\n\nAlthough rare, gastrointestinal adverse effects may occur from taking fluconazole. Itraconazole can lead to gastrointestinal upsets, diarrhea, and peripheral edema, particularly when combined with calcium channel blockers. Fluconazole and itraconazole have a significantly lower rate of hepatotoxicity compared to ketoconazole. Terbinafine can also result in gastrointestinal disorders and, in rare cases, hepatitis.\n[16]",
    "adverse_effects": "The majority of patients will not experience significant issues related to tinea pedis. However, complications can arise due to inadequate treatment and persistent skin breakdown.\n\nSecondary Bacterial Infection\n\nProlonged or severe cases of tinea pedis may result in a secondary bacterial infection. The compromised skin barrier enables bacteria to enter, potentially leading to conditions such as abscess formation.\n\nImpetigo\n\nTinea pedis can make the affected areas more susceptible to impetigo—a highly contagious infection that manifests as honey-colored, crusted lesions capable of spreading to other body parts or individuals through direct contact.\n\nFungal Nail Infection\n\nUntreated or inadequately managed tinea pedis can progress to toenail involvement or onychomycosis. Fungal organisms can infiltrate and cause onychomycosis, which is characterized by thickened, discolored, and brittle nails.\n\nCellulitis\n\nIn severe cases, tinea pedis can advance to cellulitis of the foot and leg. Cellulitis manifests as redness, warmth, swelling, and pain in the affected area, often accompanied by systemic symptoms.\n[18]\n[19]\n\nLymphangitis\n\nChronic or severe tinea pedis can result in lymphangitis, characterized by the appearance of red streaks extending from the affected area and swelling and tenderness of the lymphatic vessels.\n\nAllergic Contact Dermatitis\n\nSome individuals may experience a local allergic reaction to antifungal medications or other topical treatments for tinea pedis. This can lead to allergic contact dermatitis, characterized by redness, itching, and a rash at the application site.\n\nChronic or Recurrent Infection\n\nOccasionally, tinea pedis may develop into a chronic or recurrent condition, necessitating long-term management and preventive measures. The persistent nature of the infection can substantially impact the individual's quality of life and foot health.\n\nAlthough tinea pedis can be associated with these complications, not all patients will experience them. Prompt and appropriate treatment and adherence to preventive measures can help minimize the risk of complications and contribute to the successful management of tinea pedis."
