Because NSAIDs reduce the rate of ulcer healing in the stomach and duodenum, it is also possible that NSAIDs may delay healing and exaggerate the mucosal injury caused by oral bisphosphonates. Theoretical concerns exist regarding the potential for increased risk and severity of renal impairment during coadministration of bisphosphonates with high dosages or chronic use of NSAIDs due to additive or synergistic nephrotoxic effects on the kidney. The use of bisphosphonates has been associated with nephrotoxicity manifested as deterioration of renal function and renal failure. Cases have primarily involved intravenous formulations of the drugs such as pamidronic acid and zoledronic acid, especially when they are administered too rapidly. The risk of hypocalcemia may also be increased, as drug-induced renal tubular damage can lead to renal loss of calcium and other electrolytes such as magnesium. Bisphosphonates alone often cause mild, asymptomatic hypocalcemia via inhibitive effects on bone resorption and possibly chelation of blood calcium. Chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be associated with renal toxicities including elevations in serum creatinine and BUN, tubular necrosis, glomerulitis, renal papillary necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and renal failure.",

Natriuretic and diuretic effects may also be reduced, as NSAIDs have been reported to cause sodium and water retention, which may account for the increased risk of congestive heart failure associated with the combination.

Specifically, concurrent use of ddI and d4T has been associated with an increased risk of pancreatitis, several cases of which have been fatal. Additionally, the risk and severity of NRTI-related peripheral neuropathy may be additively or synergistically increased. Although rare, the syndrome of lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis (with or without pancreatitis) may also occur more frequently with this combination than with antiretroviral regimens containing either drug alone or other combinations of NRTIs. Fatal lactic acidosis has been reported in pregnant women receiving ddI and d4T with other antiretroviral agents, although it is unclear if pregnancy is a specific risk factor.",
      "management_text": "Close observation for signs and symptoms of toxicity is recommended if ddI and d4T must be used together, particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or elderly patients. Both drugs should be suspended if pancreatitis is suspected, and ddI discontinued permanently if pancreatitis is confirmed. Reinstitution of d4T, if necessary, should be undertaken with caution following recovery. Prompt withdrawal of these drugs is also essential in patients who develop peripheral neuropathy to avoid irreversible damage. Therapy may be reinstituted following resolution of neuropathy symptoms, but reduced dosages are recommended. Likewise, treatment should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity, and permanent discontinuation considered if the syndrome is confirmed. In pregnant women, the manufacturers recommend that the combination of ddI and d4T be used with caution and only if potential benefit clearly outweighs the risks. Patients should be advised to seek medical attention promptly if symptoms of toxicity occur such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain/distention, fatigue, unexplained weight loss, tachypnea, dyspnea, motor weakness, numbness, tingling, and pain in hands and feet.",

Liver enzymes and bilirubin should be measured prior to initiation of leflunomide/teriflunomide therapy and at least monthly for the first six months of treatment and every 6 to 8 weeks thereafter. Patients with preexisting liver disease or elevated baseline liver enzymes (i.e., ALT greater than two times ULN) should not receive leflunomide or teriflunomide. Patients who develop elevated serum ALT greater than three times ULN while receiving these medications should discontinue treatment and be given washout procedures with cholestyramine or activated charcoal to accelerate elimination of leflunomide's active metabolite from plasma, which otherwise may take up to two years. Follow-up monitoring should be conducted at least weekly until the ALT value is within normal range, and washout procedures repeated as necessary. All patients treated with leflunomide or teriflunomide should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience potential signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as fever, rash, itching, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, malaise, right upper quadrant pain, dark urine, pale stools, and jaundice.",

Paroxetine and norfluoxetine (the active metabolite of fluoxetine), in particular, are potent inhibitors of CYP450 2D6 and may be more likely than other SSRIs to cause the interaction. On the other hand, fluvoxamine is a potent inhibitor of CYP450 1A2 and may significantly interact with propranolol, which is a substrate of both CYP450 2D6 and 1A2.",

Cardiac function should be closely monitored and the beta-blocker dosage adjusted accordingly, particularly following initiation, discontinuation or change of dosage of SSRI in patients who are stabilized on their beta-blocker regimen. Due to the long half-life of fluoxetine and its active metabolite, norfluoxetine, the risk of an interaction may exist for an extended period (up to several weeks) after discontinuation of fluoxetine. To avoid the interaction, use of beta-blockers that are primarily eliminated by the kidney such as atenolol, acebutolol, betaxolol, carteolol, and nadolol may be considered.",
