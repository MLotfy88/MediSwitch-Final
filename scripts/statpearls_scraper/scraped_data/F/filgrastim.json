    "indications": "Filgrastim is contraindicated in patients with allergic reactions to\nE. coli\n-derived proteins, filgrastim, or any component of the product.",
    "mechanism": "Filgrastim is a recombinant human methionyl granulocyte colony-stimulating factor(G-CSF) which stimulates the proliferation, maturation of neutrophil progenitors, and functional end-cell activation. It also facilitates their release into the blood.\n[15]\n\nFilgrastim exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics with a short half-life of 3.5 hours, with filgrastim concentration and neutrophil count being the determinants of clearance.\n[16]\nThe kidneys clear the drug.\n\nThe bioavailability of filgrastim after subcutaneous administration is 60 to 70%.",
    "administration": "Filgrastim is available as a clear colorless preservative clear liquid in single-dose vials(300 mcg/ml or 480 mcg/1.6ml) or single-dose prefilled syringes(300 mcg/0.5ml or 480 mcg/0.8ml), which is administered subcutaneously or intravenously.\n\nIV Compatibility\n\nCompatible: 5% dextrose; 5% glucose; 5% dextrose plus albumin (human); 5% glucose plus albumin (human)\nIncompatible: Saline\n\nIt should NOT be administered 24 hours before and after receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. The safety and efficacy of the simultaneous use of filgrastim and cytotoxic chemotherapy have not undergone evaluation.\n\nIn Cancer Patients Receiving Myelosuppression\nTherapy/Adults with AML\n\nRecommended starting dose is 5 mcg/kg/day‚ administered as a single daily injection by SC bolus injection‚ by short IV infusion (15 to 30 minutes) ‚ or by continuous SC or IV infusion.\n\nDoses can be titrated by 5 mcg/kg/day for each chemotherapy cycle, depending on the duration and severity of cytotoxicity.\n\nThe recommendation is to administer filgrastim for up to 2 weeks or until ANC is 10000/mm^3. Discontinue drug if ANC>10000/mm^3.\n[17]\n\nPatients with Non-myeloid Malignancies Undergoing Myeloablative Therapy following Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT)\n\nStarting dose is 10 mcg/kg via short IV infusion (over 15 to 30 minutes) or continuous IV infusion administered at least 24hrs after BMT or cytotoxic chemotherapy. Dosage adjustment for neutrophil recovery Following BMT via short IV infusion (over 15 to 30 minutes) or continuous IV infusion:\n\nWhen ANC >1000/mm^3 for 3 consecutive days: reduce to 5 mcg/kg/day\nIf ANC >1000/mm^3 for an additional 3 or more consecutive days: Discontinue this drug.\nThen if, ANC < 1000/mm^3: resume at 5 mcg/kg/day\n\nIf ANC <1000/mm3 while receiving 5 mcg/kg/day: Increase to 10 mcg/kg and repeat the above dose adjustment steps.\n\nPatients Undergoing Peripheral\nBlood Progenitor Collection (PBPC) and Therapy\n\nThe recommended dose of filgrastim for the mobilization of PBPC is 10 mcg/kg/day subcutaneously‚ either as a bolus or a continuous infusion.\n\nThe recommendation is to give filgrastim for at least 4 days before the first leukapheresis procedure and continued until the last leukapheresis.\n\nPatients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia\n\nConfirm diagnosis before starting\ntreatment.\n\nCongenital Neutropenia:\n\nThe recommended starting dose is 6 mcg/kg BID via subcutaneous injection.\n\nCyclic/Idiopathic Neutropenia:\n\nRecommended starting dose is 5 mcg/kg once a day\n\nIn the severe chronic neutropenia post-marketing surveillance study, the median daily dose was:\n\nCongenital neutropenia: 6mcg/kg\nCyclic neutropenia: 2.1 mcg/kg\nIdiopathic neutropenia: 1.2 mcg/kg\n\nDoses administered via subcutaneous injection\n\nPatients with Radiation-Induced Neutropenia\n\n10 mcg/kg via subcutaneous injection once a day.\n\nPediatric and Pregnant Female Population\n\nPharmacokinetics in pediatric patients after chemotherapy is the same as adults with weight-based adjusted doses. There are safety and efficacy studies that have been conducted on the severe chronic neutropenia and PBPC population, revealing no significant adverse effects.\n\nThe drug is pregnancy category C. There are very few studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of the drug in pregnant women. Observational studies reported no association between filgrastim use and pregnancy outcomes, neonatal complications, or infections. The clinician should weigh the benefits and risks before administering the drug to these patients.\n[7]\n[18]",
    "adverse_effects": "Bone pain is the most commonly reported adverse effect of filgrastim.\n\nA systematic literature review by Dale et al. reported bone pain and other musculoskeletal symptoms as being the most common adverse effect of filgrastim while also noting the incidence of other adverse effects that were not as significant in comparison.\n[15]\n\nThe various adverse reactions noted in clinical trials that can occur in the different subsets of patients for which filgrastim is indicated include:\n\nCancer patients receiving myelosuppressive therapy\n- Arthralgia, back pain, bone pain, nausea, chest pain, fatigue, pyrexia, dizziness, cough, dyspnea, rash, thrombocytopenia, elevated LDH, elevated alkaline phosphatase.\nAML patients receiving induction/consolidation chemotherapy\n- Back pain, pain in extremity, erythema, maculopapular rash, epistaxis. In patients with sequelae of underlying malignancy/ cytotoxic chemotherapy- Diarrhea, constipation, transfusion reaction.\n\nPatients with non-myeloid malignancies undergoing myeloablative therapy following Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT)\n- Rash, hypersensitivity. In patients receiving intensive chemotherapy followed by autologous BMT - hypertension, sepsis, bronchitis, insomnia, anemia, thrombocytopenia.\n\nPatients undergoing peripheral\nblood progenitor collection and therapy\n- Headache, bone pain, pyrexia, elevated alkaline phosphatase.\nPatients with severe chronic neutropenia\n- arthralgia, back pain, bone pain, muscle spasms, pain in extremity, chest pain, diarrhea, alopecia, epistaxis, hypoesthesia, splenomegaly, anemia\nAlthough total infection rates were significantly lower in filgrastim-treated patients, the incidence of upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infections was higher compared to placebo.\n\nOther Adverse Effects reported since Filgrastim's Approval are as Follows\n\nAortitis\n[19]\nCapillary leak syndrome\n[20]\nCutaneous vasculitis\n[21]\nDecreased bone density/Osteoporosis\n[22]\nGlomerulonephritis\n[23]\nLeukocytosis\n[24]\nPulmonary toxicity - ARDS, alveolar hemorrhage/Hemoptysis\n[25]\nSevere allergic reactions including anaphylaxis\n[26]\nSickle Cell disorders - severe sickle cell crisis has been reported in some filgrastim-treated sickle cell patients\n[27]\nSplenomegaly/Splenic rupture - Filgrastim-treated patients with symptoms of abdominal pain, especially LUQ, require evaluation.\n[28]\nSweet syndrome\n[29]\n\nThere is limited data on the incidence or frequency of these adverse effects. There have been a few reports of incidence of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and/or myelodysplastic syndrome in certain populations receiving filgrastim, especially patients with congenital neutropenia. The Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry published a 10-year report in 2003 on the incidence of AML/myelodysplastic syndrome occurring in 35 of 387 patients with congenital neutropenia, but with no established relationship to the dose and duration of filgrastim.\n[7]",
    "monitoring": "The recommended starting dosage is usually 5mcg/kg or 10mcg/kg, depending on the indication, as noted earlier. There has been very limited data regarding the maximum tolerable dosage of filgrastim. Although rare, doses of up to and even greater than 100 mcg/kg have been used in individuals with minimal toxic effects.\n[7]\n\nSome studies noted a plateau in dose-response curves when the dosage exceeded 10 mcg/kg in bone marrow transplant patients.\n\nBaseline CBC and platelet counts should be obtained prior to administration and following filgrastim administration.\n\nThe following are the required monitoring parameters:\n\nTwice weekly in cancer patients on myelosuppressive therapy or AML patients receiving induction/consolidation therapy.\nFrequently in bone marrow transplant patients.\nAfter four days of filgrastim initiation in patients undergoing PBPC collection and discontinued if neutrophil count >100,000/mm^3.\nDuring the initial four weeks of filgrastim therapy and the two weeks following any adjustment in the dose in patients with severe chronic neutropenia\nWhen a patient is clinically stable, counts should be monitored monthly in the first year and less frequently thereafter.\nEvery three days until ANC>1000/mm^3 for three consecutive CBCs in patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive radiation doses.\n\nIt is advised not to use filgrastim with concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy due to a lack of safety and efficacy studies.",
    "toxicity": "There is minimal data regarding the maximum tolerable dosage. Adverse effects that occur with filgrastim use mainly resolve following discontinuation of the drug. Some are manageable with supportive measures, e.g., bone pain, which is a common side effect usually managed with analgesics. Monitoring is essential to track response and minimize complications.\n\nAlthough rare(<5%), Leukocytosis with WBC >100,000/mm^3 has been observed in BMT patients with minimal adverse effects. The recommendation is to discontinue the drug if it occurs to prevent potential complications.\n\nThere is no antidote for the reversal of filgrastim."
