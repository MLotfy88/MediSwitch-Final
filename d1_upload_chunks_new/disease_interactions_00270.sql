Morbidity and mortality are increased with hypertoxin-producing strains of C difficile; these infections can be resistant to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy.  CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea after antibacterial use.  Since CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after antibacterial use, careful medical history is necessary.  Therapy with broad-spectrum antibacterials and other agents with significant antibacterial activity should be administered cautiously in patients with history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis; pseudomembranous colitis (generally characterized by severe, persistent diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps, and sometimes associated with the passage of blood and mucus), if it occurs, may be more severe in these patients and may be associated with flares in underlying disease activity.  Antibacterial drugs not directed against C difficile may need to be stopped if CDAD is suspected or confirmed.  Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C difficile, and surgical evaluation should be started as clinically indicated.', '3', '', 'DDInter', 0);
