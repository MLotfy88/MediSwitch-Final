    "indications": "Facial implant surgery has limited contraindications, which include the following:\n\nIncomplete craniofacial growth\nLarge volume deficits more appropriately addressed by alternative treatments\nActive infection\nInadequate bony or soft tissue support\n\nGrowth patterns and predictions are critical when evaluating candidates for facial implants. Female individuals typically begin and complete craniofacial growth earlier than male individuals.\n[17]\nThe term “growth cessation” is variably defined. The Craniofacial Growth Consortium Study compared multiple definitions, defining growth cessation as either annual growth of less than 0.1 mm or a growth rate below 10% of peak growth velocity. Serial cephalometric imaging allows for assessment of growth cessation, with linear measurements from consecutive cephalograms used to determine growth rates.\n[18]\n\nPatients with skeletal discrepancies associated with dental malocclusion are generally better suited for orthognathic surgery, particularly when osteotomies are required for extensive augmentation. However, patient preference may favor implant-based correction. Thin soft tissue coverage limits the maximal implant dimensions due to increased risk of implant visibility and palpability.",
    "clinical_significance": "Facial implant surgery is highly versatile and offers an alternative to more invasive procedures, such as genial horizontal osteotomies. Less invasive methods generally reduce costs by using inexpensive hardware and anesthetic alternatives, and they require less operative time. Facial implant placement is routinely performed under general anesthesia or intravenous sedation. However, awake procedures using local anesthesia are also feasible.\n\nA 2014 study from the University of California, Los Angeles reported that operating room costs may reach $35 per minute.\n[39]\nAlternative anesthetic approaches may reduce both general anesthetic risk and financial burden for patients with medical or economic limitations. Recovery after facial implant placement depends primarily on soft-tissue healing and typically requires only a few weeks, whereas bony surgery necessitates a significantly longer stabilization period.\n\nChin implants can enhance anterior and lateral projection and may also be used to narrow the chin, improving overall facial balance without osteotomies. Malar implants increase midfacial projection, contributing to a more harmonious and youthful facial appearance.\n\nMandibular angle implants can improve jawline definition and increase lower facial width. Implant placement may be used to augment bigonial width in patients requiring posttraumatic jaw reconstruction or correction of facial growth abnormalities. Individuals pursuing a more masculine facial structure as part of gender-affirmation surgery may also be candidates for mandibular angle augmentation. Additionally, implants can restore volume and skeletal support in the aging face across 3 dimensions.\n\nWith appropriate training and experience, facial implant placement is a safe and efficient procedure. Facial implant surgery provides an alternative to more extensive surgical interventions for patients seeking facial harmonization, a more youthful appearance, or alignment of facial structure with gender identity. The procedure also facilitates collaboration among interprofessional teams, including otorhinolaryngology and anesthesia specialists, particularly in the context of gender-affirmation surgeries."
