The use of estrogen-containing oral contraceptives is additionally deemed contraindicated in patients with a history of such disorders and/or current cerebrovascular or coronary artery disease.  Females with a history of migraines with aura are at an increased risk for stroke and this stroke risk may be further increased in females who have migraines with aura with use of combination oral contraceptives.  Hypercoagulability and changes in various clotting factors and blood components have been observed in women receiving estrogen therapy.  Although the clinical significance of these effects is unknown, epidemiological data suggest it may be dose-dependent.  The risk is probably slight with the use of newer, low-dose oral contraceptives in the absence of known risk factors (e.g., smoker, particularly over the age of 35; hypertension; hyperlipidemia; obesity; diabetes; age over 40).  However, a much more significant risk has been reported with higher dosages, such as those used to treat prostate or metastatic breast cancer or those used in older formulations of birth control pills.

Clinically significant blood pressure increases have been reported during estrogen therapy, particularly in patients receiving high dosages or treated with oral contraceptive combinations having high progestational activity.  These effects also increase with duration of therapy and patient age.  Therapy with estrogens should be administered cautiously in patients with preexisting hypertension.  Patients should be monitored for changes in cardiovascular status, and their antihypertensive regimen adjusted or estrogen therapy withdrawn as necessary.

The use of estrogen-containing oral contraceptives is additionally deemed contraindicated in patients with a history of such disorders and/or current cerebrovascular or coronary artery disease.  Females with a history of migraines with aura are at an increased risk for stroke and this stroke risk may be further increased in females who have migraines with aura with use of combination oral contraceptives.  Hypercoagulability and changes in various clotting factors and blood components have been observed in women receiving estrogen therapy.  Although the clinical significance of these effects is unknown, epidemiological data suggest it may be dose-dependent.  The risk is probably slight with the use of newer, low-dose oral contraceptives in the absence of known risk factors (e.g., smoker, particularly over the age of 35; hypertension; hyperlipidemia; obesity; diabetes; age over 40).  However, a much more significant risk has been reported with higher dosages, such as those used to treat prostate or metastatic breast cancer or those used in older formulations of birth control pills.  Therapy with estrogens should be administered cautiously in the lowest effective dosage and only after careful consideration of risks and benefits.
