      "ingredient2": "Iron Dextran",
      "severity": "Major",
      "effect": "Limited data suggest that ACE inhibitors may increase the risk of systemic adverse effects associated with the use of iron dextran. The exact mechanism of interaction is unclear. Certain systemic reactions stemming from parenteral iron therapy are thought to be mediated by inflammatory substances such as bradykinin in response to iron-catalyzed generation of toxic free radicals. Since ACE inhibitors decrease the breakdown of kinins, it is conceivable that they may potentiate these reactions. Anaphylactic-type reactions, including fatalities, have followed the parenteral administration of iron dextran. Such reactions occur most often within the first several minutes of administration and are generally characterized by sudden onset of respiratory difficulty and/or cardiovascular collapse. The extent of risk for anaphylactic-type reactions following exposure to any specific iron dextran product is unknown, but may vary among the products due to differences in chemical characteristics.",
      "management_text": "Patients should be closely monitored during and after parenteral administration of iron dextran, regardless of whether they are being treated with an ACE inhibitor. This is particularly important in patients with a history of drug allergy or multiple drug allergies or an immune/inflammatory condition such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis. Resuscitation techniques and personnel trained in the detection and treatment of anaphylactic-type reactions should be readily available. Prior to the first therapeutic dose, a test dose corresponding to 25 mg iron should be injected gradually. Although anaphylactic reactions are usually evident within a few minutes, observe patients for at least one hour before administering the remainder of the therapeutic dose. Administration must be stopped immediately if signs of an anaphylactoid reaction are observed. Patients should also be closely monitored during each subsequent administration of iron dextran. Fatal reactions have occurred following the test dose and also in situations where the test dose was tolerated. According to some studies, non-dextran parenteral iron formulations may be associated with a lower risk of adverse effects, especially death and life-threatening reactions such as anaphylaxis, cardiac arrest, and respiratory depression.",

Mipomersen has not been studied with other LDL-lowering agents that can also increase hepatic fat, thus concomitant use is not recommended. Patients treated with mipomersen should have serum ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin measured prior to initiation of treatment and regularly during treatment in accordance with the product labeling, and the dosing adjusted or interrupted as necessary. Since alcohol may increase levels of hepatic fat and induce or exacerbate liver injury, the manufacturer recommends that patients taking mipomersen not consume more than one alcoholic drink per day.

In severe cases, patients may progress to central nervous system depression, stupor, seizures, acidosis, cardiac arrhythmias, syncope, shock, coma, and death.  Methemoglobinemia should be considered if central cyanosis is unresponsive to oxygen.  Calculated oxygen saturation and pulse oximetry are generally not accurate in the setting of methemoglobinemia.  The diagnosis can be confirmed by an elevated methemoglobin level of at least 10% using co-oximetry.  Methemoglobin concentrations greater than 10% of total hemoglobin will typically cause cyanosis, and levels over 70% are frequently fatal.  However, symptom severity is not always related to methemoglobin levels.  Mild cases often respond to withdrawal of offending agents and symptomatic support.  If patient does not respond to administration of oxygen, clinically significant or symptomatic methemoglobinemia can be treated with methylene blue 1 to 2 mg/kg by slow intravenous injection over 5 to 10 minutes, which may be repeated within 30 to 60 minutes if necessary.  Higher dosages of methylene blue (usually greater than 7 mg/kg) should be avoided, as it can paradoxically exacerbate methemoglobinemia.  Additionally, methylene blue is ineffective and can cause hemolytic anemia in patients with G6PD deficiency.  These patients may be treated with exchange transfusion, dialysis, and/or hyperbaric oxygenation in addition to symptomatic support.",

Patients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience potential signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as fever, rash, itching, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, malaise, right upper quadrant pain, dark urine, pale stools, and jaundice. Baseline and regular monitoring of hepatic function is recommended. Thioguanine therapy should be discontinued if there is evidence of toxic hepatitis or biliary stasis, as reversal of signs and symptoms of liver toxicity have been reported upon withdrawal. Early indications of liver toxicity are signs associated with portal hypertension such as thrombocytopenia out of proportion with neutropenia and splenomegaly.
