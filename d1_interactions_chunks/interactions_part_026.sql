The use of higher than recommended dosages of loperamide (e.g., through abuse or misuse) has been associated with serious and potentially fatal cardiac adverse events, including syncope, cardiac arrest, and arrhythmia related to prolongation of the QT interval. Under such circumstances, coadministration with other agents that can prolong the QT interval such as quinidine or quinine may result in additive effects and increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes and sudden death. In general, the risk of an individual agent or a combination of agents causing ventricular arrhythmia in association with QT prolongation is largely unpredictable but may be increased by certain underlying risk factors such as congenital long QT syndrome, cardiac disease, and electrolyte disturbances (e.g., hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia).

If loperamide-induced cardiotoxicity is suspected, promptly discontinue loperamide and initiate therapy to manage and prevent cardiac arrhythmias and adverse outcomes.

Opioid and other adverse effects may be enhanced. The proposed mechanism is inhibition of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux transporter by quinidine, resulting in increased gastrointestinal absorption as well as increased penetration of loperamide across the blood brain barrier. The use of higher than recommended dosages of loperamide (e.g., through abuse or misuse) has been associated with serious and potentially fatal cardiac adverse events, including syncope, cardiac arrest, and arrhythmia related to prolongation of the QT interval. Under such circumstances, coadministration with other agents that can prolong the QT interval such as quinidine or quinine may result in additive effects and increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes and sudden death. In general, the risk of an individual agent or a combination of agents causing ventricular arrhythmia in association with QT prolongation is largely unpredictable but may be increased by certain underlying risk factors such as congenital long QT syndrome, cardiac disease, and electrolyte disturbances (e.g., hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia). In addition, the extent of drug-induced QT prolongation is dependent on the particular drug(s) involved and dosage(s) of the drug(s).', 'DDInter', 'Caution is recommended if loperamide is used with quinidine, a drug that can prolong the QT interval as well as increase the plasma and CNS concentrations of loperamide.
