The risk of systemic anticholinergic effects following topical administration depends on variables such as strength of the product, size of the application area, frequency of application, and use of occlusive dressing. Systemic effects are uncommon following oral inhalation or nasal administration due to the poor absorption of quaternary ammonium compounds from gastrointestinal and nasal mucosa.', 'DDInter', 'Topical and inhaled anticholinergic preparations should preferably not be used in combination with other anticholinergic agents or agents with significant anticholinergic effects such as antihistamines, antispasmodics, neuroleptics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, tricyclic antidepressants, and class IA antiarrhythmics (especially disopyramide). Caution is advised if concomitant use cannot be avoided, particularly in the elderly and those with significantly impaired renal and/or hepatic function.', 'Synergism', 'Topical and inhaled anticholinergic preparations should preferably not be used in combination with other anticholinergic agents or agents with significant anticholinergic effects such as antihistamines, antispasmodics, neuroleptics, phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, tricyclic antidepressants, and class IA antiarrhythmics (especially disopyramide).', 'Moderate', 'pharmacodynamic', NULL, 'https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/57276/', '', 'Levocetirizine, Trimethobenzamide, Terfenadine, Astemizole', 'Mometasone furoate, Terbutaline, Budesonide, Mometasone, Epinephrine, Olodaterol, Fluticasone, Cromoglicic acid, Salbutamol, Orciprenaline, Pirbuterol, More', 1767369485);
