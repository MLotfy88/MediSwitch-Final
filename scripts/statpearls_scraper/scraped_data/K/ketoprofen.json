    "clinical_significance": "Opioids increase the risk of addiction and overdose. The United States is currently in the midst of an opioid epidemic. Moreover, limited evidence supports the use of long-term opioid use for managing chronic pain. The list of nonopioid treatments for pain is extensive, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, corticosteroids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and topical medications. Other treatment modalities include physical therapy, chiropractic, acupuncture, TENS, cognitive behavioral therapy, myofascial release massage, and mindfulness practices. Interventional pain management procedures include peripheral nerve blocks, joint injections, trigger point injections, epidural steroid injections, and radiofrequency ablations. More invasive neuromodulation procedures such as spinal cord, dorsal root ganglion, and peripheral nerve stimulator therapy can also be considered for intractable pain.\n\nNot all patients are candidates for every available nonopioid pain therapy. A patient's interprofessional care team should know the vast array of available nonopioid treatment options and understand each modality's mechanism of action, indications, and associated complications. The level of existing evidence in support of efficacy should also be considered. When making a treatment decision, existing medical and psychiatric comorbidities and patient preferences should also be considered. A biopsychosocial model has been recommended for designing an individualized multimodal treatment plan. Early consultation with pain specialists should be considered when treating patients with chronic pain for optimal outcomes.\n[58]\n[59]"
