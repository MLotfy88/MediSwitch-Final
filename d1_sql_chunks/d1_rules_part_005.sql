Serotonin syndrome is a rare but serious and potentially fatal condition thought to result from hyperstimulation of brainstem 5-HT1A and 2A receptors. Symptoms of the serotonin syndrome may include mental status changes such as irritability, altered consciousness, confusion, hallucinations, and coma; autonomic dysfunction such as tachycardia, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, shivering, blood pressure lability, and mydriasis; neuromuscular abnormalities such as hyperreflexia, myoclonus, tremor, rigidity, and ataxia; and gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

Since many serotonergic agents can also cause central nervous system depression, concomitant use with opioids may result in increased sedation and impairment of judgment, thinking, and psychomotor skills.', NULL, 'Caution is advised when opioids are used concomitantly with serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), other antidepressants/psychotropic agents (e.', NULL, 'Caution is advised when opioids are used concomitantly with serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), other antidepressants/psychotropic agents (e.g., amoxapine, buspirone, lithium, maprotiline, mirtazepine, nefazodone, trazodone, vilazodone), 5-HT1 receptor agonists (triptans), 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, cyclobenzaprine, dextromethorphan, 5-hydroxytryptophan, and St. John''s wort. Patients should be monitored for symptoms of the serotonin syndrome during treatment. If serotonin syndrome develops or is suspected during the course of therapy, all serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately and supportive care rendered as necessary.', 'Synergism', 'Naltrexone, Acetaminophen, Ibuprofen, Acetylsalicylic acid, Naloxone, Benzonatate', 'Lidocaine, Tetracaine', 'Moderate', NULL, 'DDInter', 'pharmacodynamic', NULL, 'https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/5131/', '[1] Vizcaychipi MP, Walker S, Palazzo M "Serotonin syndrome triggered by tramadol."

Since many serotonergic agents can also cause central nervous system depression, concomitant use with opioids may result in increased sedation and impairment of judgment, thinking, and psychomotor skills.', NULL, 'Caution is advised when opioids are used concomitantly with serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), other antidepressants/psychotropic agents (e.', NULL, 'Caution is advised when opioids are used concomitantly with serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), other antidepressants/psychotropic agents (e.g., amoxapine, buspirone, lithium, maprotiline, mirtazepine, nefazodone, trazodone, vilazodone), 5-HT1 receptor agonists (triptans), 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, cyclobenzaprine, dextromethorphan, 5-hydroxytryptophan, and St. John''s wort. Patients should be monitored for symptoms of the serotonin syndrome during treatment. If serotonin syndrome develops or is suspected during the course of therapy, all serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately and supportive care rendered as necessary.', 'Synergism', 'Naltrexone, Acetaminophen, Ibuprofen, Acetylsalicylic acid, Naloxone, Benzonatate', NULL, 'Moderate', NULL, 'DDInter', 'pharmacodynamic', NULL, 'https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/5342/', '[1] Vizcaychipi MP, Walker S, Palazzo M "Serotonin syndrome triggered by tramadol."

Since many serotonergic agents can also cause central nervous system depression, concomitant use with opioids may result in increased sedation and impairment of judgment, thinking, and psychomotor skills.', NULL, 'Caution is advised when opioids are used concomitantly with serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), other antidepressants/psychotropic agents (e.', NULL, 'Caution is advised when opioids are used concomitantly with serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), other antidepressants/psychotropic agents (e.g., amoxapine, buspirone, lithium, maprotiline, mirtazepine, nefazodone, trazodone, vilazodone), 5-HT1 receptor agonists (triptans), 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, cyclobenzaprine, dextromethorphan, 5-hydroxytryptophan, and St. John''s wort. Patients should be monitored for symptoms of the serotonin syndrome during treatment. If serotonin syndrome develops or is suspected during the course of therapy, all serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately and supportive care rendered as necessary.', 'Synergism', 'Opium, Dextropropoxyphene, Naloxone, Naltrexone, Benzonatate, Clofedanol, Pentoxyverine', 'Rimegepant, Eptinezumab, Dihydroergotamine, Ubrogepant, Ergotamine, Galcanezumab, Atogepant, Methysergide, Erenumab, Fremanezumab, Tinidazole, More', 'Moderate', NULL, 'DDInter', 'pharmacodynamic', NULL, 'https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/5379/', '[1] Vizcaychipi MP, Walker S, Palazzo M "Serotonin syndrome triggered by tramadol."

Serotonin syndrome has been reported with both 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and tramadol, and combined use of these drugs may increase the risk of this rare but serious and potentially fatal condition. Meanwhile, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists may inhibit serotonin-mediated analgesia of tramadol at the spinal level. Treatment with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists has been associated with dose-dependent prolongation of the QT interval. Tramadol may also prolong the QT interval, and theoretically, coadministration of multiple agents that can prolong the QT interval may result in additive effects and increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes and sudden death.

In addition, the potential risk for serotonin syndrome should be considered even when administering serotonergic agents sequentially, as some agents may demonstrate a prolonged elimination half-life. If serotonin syndrome develops or is suspected during the course of therapy, all serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately and supportive care rendered as necessary. Moderately ill patients may benefit from the administration of a serotonin antagonist (e.g., cyproheptadine, chlorpromazine). Severe cases should be managed under consultation with a toxicologist and may require sedation, neuromuscular paralysis, intubation, and mechanical ventilation in addition to the other measures. The possibility of a diminished therapeutic response to tramadol should also be considered during concomitant therapy with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Due to the potential for additive effects on the QT interval, ECG monitoring may also be appropriate. Particular care should be exercised in patients suspected to be at an increased risk of torsade de pointes.
