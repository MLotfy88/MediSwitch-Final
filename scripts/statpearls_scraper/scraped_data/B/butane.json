    "clinical_significance": "Because of the wide array of chemicals that workers may be exposed to on the job, it may be difficult to determine the offending chemical and subsequent treatment strategies. A recent analysis of 12 professions highlighted this by reporting that as many as 685 different disinfectants are not made for human use, with 152 active ingredients and 763 insecticides with 97 active ingredients used in the industry currently.\n[9]\nTwo other analyses showed that chemical exposures had been reported with 200 to 308 different chemicals across multiple professions.\n[10]\n[11]\nSuch a wide variety of chemicals used in the workplace can make workups difficult, so obtaining a quick but thorough history from either the patient or a witness is critical to narrow in on a specific chemical exposure and subsequent treatment strategy.\n\nPast analyses have shown that the most common chemical exposures, most of which were in the workplace, were corrosive liquids and flammable gases.\n[10]\nThe most common chemicals causing the hazardous insult were propane-butane, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, methane, hydroxides, ammonia, and butyric acid. While this is not an exhaustive list of the potential chemical exposures that may present from outside the hospital, they are the most common. Therefore, they should be higher on the differential diagnosis when dealing with unknown chemical exposure. The chemical agents commonly associated with chemical exposures within the hospital include cleaning chemicals like sterilizing agents, disinfectants, detergents, solvents, heavy metals, medical treatments like antineoplastic or antibiotic drugs, and anesthetic gases and laboratory chemicals like formaldehyde and xylene.  Certain hospital personnel are more likely to work with these chemicals than others, so exposure to chemicals commonly used within their job description should be higher on the differential diagnosis. Additionally, just as employees working with radiation sources like fluoroscopy must monitor their exposure, steps should be taken to monitor both individual exposure and ambient levels to chemicals of interest to reduce overall chemical exposure.\n[12]\n\nSecondary exposure is a topic of concern when treating patients with chemical exposures. A recent analysis of over 120,000 chemical incidents showed that only 9 secondary exposure cases were experienced by hospital personnel when treating a patient with chemical exposure. The most common mechanism of secondary exposure was inhalation. They concluded that standard personal protective equipment, including gloves and a gown, is sufficient to protect hospital personnel when treating these patients. Further equipment is only necessary when treating highly toxic like sarin.\n[13]\n\nOne of the most underrepresented problems associated with hazardous chemical exposure is the long-term sequelae. People exposed to hazardous chemicals may not present with acute health problems and may not be further concerned. However, the pathogenesis of disease states like cancer may take many years to develop after the exposure, depending on the nature and duration of the exposure. For people who have acute exposure to a hazardous chemical like an accidental spill or inhalation, long-term monitoring should be performed to identify any signs of disease.\n[14]\nAdditionally, steps should be taken to reduce further exposure, likely worsening and speeding up any pathologic states.",
    "monitoring": "The hospital and healthcare team should be involved in the active promotion of chemical safety and education on the risks associated with exposures. Additionally, proper signage, warning labels on containers holding dangerous chemicals, and the use of appropriate personal protective equipment can help maintain hospital employee safety and save lives.\n[8]\nStrategies during the education process should include pictograms and labels associated with the specific hazards of a chemical so hospital employees can better understand the risks and implications of chemical exposure. The inclusion of these clear visual depictions of the chemical hazard has proven very effective. It is estimated to have contributed to a reduction of between 107,000 and 459,000 acute chemical injuries as well as significant decreases in carcinogen exposures since their widespread use began.\n[19]\n[20]\nChemical hazards pose a significant threat to employees' health when handling them. Still, proper education, precautions, and labeling have significantly reduced the incidence of acute exposure and long-term complications."
