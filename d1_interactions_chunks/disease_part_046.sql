With the exception of aspirin, the platelet effects seen with most NSAIDs at usual recommended dosages are generally slight and of relatively short duration but may be more pronounced in patients with underlying hemostatic abnormalities.  Thrombocytopenia has also been reported rarely during NSAID use.  Therapy with NSAIDs should be administered cautiously in patients with significant active bleeding or a hemorrhagic diathesis, including hemostatic and/or coagulation defects associated with hemophilia, vitamin K deficiency, hypoprothrombinemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopathy, or severe hepatic impairment.  NSAIDs that selectively inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 (i.e., COX-2 inhibitors) do not appear to affect platelet function or bleeding time at indicated dosages and may be preferable if risk of bleeding is a concern.', '2', '"Product Information.
