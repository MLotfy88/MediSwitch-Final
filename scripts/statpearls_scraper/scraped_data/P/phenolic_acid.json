    "indications": "Dopamine is absolutely contraindicated in patients with pheochromocytoma.\n\nWarnings and Precautions\n\nCardiac disorders:\nIn patients with conditions of the heart or circulatory system, the intravenous administration of dopamine is relatively contraindicated. These conditions may include ventricular arrhythmias and tachycardia, blood vessel blockage, hypoxia, hypovolemia, and acidosis.\n\nArrhythmias:\nThe risk is greater in patients with underlying cardiac disorders, electrolyte imbalances, or structural heart disease. Management includes reducing or discontinuing dopamine and correcting electrolytes. In severe or sustained arrhythmias, antiarrhythmic therapy or cardioversion may be necessary.\n[56]\n[57]\n\nAbrupt discontinuation:\nSudden stopping of the infusion can lead to marked hypotension; therefore, taper the infusion of dopamine gradually while giving intravenous fluids to support blood volume.\n\nSevere hypersensitivity reactions:\nDopamine may contain sodium metabisulfite, which may cause allergic reactions.\n[58]\nIn susceptible individuals, this may result in life-threatening anaphylaxis or severe asthma exacerbations.",
    "mechanism": "Dopamine biosynthesis follows the same enzymatic pathway as norepinephrine, with dopamine serving as a precursor in norepinephrine production (see\nImage.\nBiosynthesis of Catecholamines: Adrenaline (Epinephrine) and Noradrenaline (Norepinephrine) with Intermediates DOPA and Dopamine).\n[10]\n[11]\nThe first step of dopamine synthesis is rate-limiting and involves the conversion of L-tyrosine to L-DOPA by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase.\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\nThis conversion requires oxygen, an iron cofactor, and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4 or THB), resulting in the addition of a hydroxyl group to the aromatic ring to form L-DOPA. This molecule subsequently converts to dopamine through the action of the aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, which involves the removal of the carboxyl group. Once synthesized, dopamine is transported into synaptic vesicles via the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 to the synaptic terminals.\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n\nIf an individual regularly consumes L-tyrosine in abundance, it readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, as does L-DOPA.\n[18]\nHowever, its utility is spatially restricted because dopamine cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. In cases where L-tyrosine levels are low, L-phenylalanine may be converted into L-tyrosine by phenylalanine hydroxylase.\n\nAfter dopamine is released into the synaptic cleft, it binds to receptors on both pre- and postsynaptic terminals, causing neuronal excitation or inhibition at the target neuron. Dopamine receptors are classified into two main families, comprising five distinct isoforms, each influencing specific intracellular signaling pathways.\n[19]\nBoth families of dopamine receptors, D1 and D2, are, by definition, G protein–coupled receptors; however, D1 receptors result in the depolarization of neurons, whereas D2 receptors inhibit neuronal firing.\n[20]\n\nOnce in the synaptic cleft, dopamine is transported back into the presynaptic neuron via dopamine transporters for repackaging or can remain in the extracellular space to be taken up by glial cells or metabolized by the cellular membrane. Dopamine may be metabolized extraneuronally by catechol-\nO\n-methyltransferase (COMT) to 3-methoxytyramine, whereas monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) rapidly metabolizes 3-methoxytyramine to homovanillic acid.\n[21]\n[22]\nAlternatively, it may undergo metabolism inside the cytoplasm, where the dual action of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) and aldehyde dehydrogenase converts dopamine to the phenolic acid 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid.\n[23]\n\nGiven this complex sequence, dopamine modulation can occur at various levels, including the entire neuron, its projections, or the neuronal circuitry across the nervous system. Additionally, dopamine is regulated at multiple stages—during its synthesis (transcriptional, translational, and posttranslational regulation), synaptic packaging (regulation of the vesicular monoamine transporter and vesicle transport to the synapse), dopamine release (neuronal depolarization, calcium signaling, and vesicle fusion), and reuptake and metabolism through regulation of the respective enzymes and their spatial localization relative to their substrate.\n[23]\n[24]\n\nAs indicated earlier, the systemic action of dopamine is mediated by various receptors (D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5) and the alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors. These G protein–coupled receptors are typically classified as either D1 or D2 based on their canonical biochemical functions, reflecting dopamine's ability to modulate adenylyl cyclase activity.\n[11]\n[25]\nHowever, based on their molecular structure, biochemical properties, and pharmacological functions, dopamine receptors are further classified into either the D1-class (D1 and D5) or the D2-class (D2, D3, and D4).\n[26]\n[27]\n[28]\n\nActivation of D1 receptors on smooth muscle, the proximal renal tubule, and the cortical collecting duct increases diuresis.\n[29]\nD2 receptors are located presynaptically on the renal nerves and within the glomeruli and adrenal cortex. The activation of these receptors results in increased renal sodium and water excretion.\n[30]\nApomorphine is a dopamine receptor agonist that may have a similar effect on these dopamine receptors.\n[31]\n[32]\nAdrenergic receptors also bind dopamine, increasing arterial smooth muscle contraction and cardiac sinoatrial node conductivity, which explains its therapeutic benefits in the heart.\n\nAlthough the blood-brain barrier specifically restricts the transport of dopamine from the systemic circulation to the CNS, further research has led to the discovery of its central role in reward-seeking behavior, wherein its transmission becomes markedly increased. Current dopamine research includes epigenetic changes and their involvement in a variety of psychiatric conditions, including substance abuse and addiction, schizophrenia, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\n[33]\n[34]\nAltogether, these conditions involve disorders of the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine pathways. A common effect of addictive drugs in the CNS is the increased release of dopamine in the striatum, classically associated with high locomotor activity and stereotypy.\n[35]\n[36]\nThe striatal dopamine increase results from axon projections arising directly from the pars compacta of the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area, respectively, which project to the nucleus accumbens and the amygdala, both of which are implicated in reward stimulation and the fear response.\n[35]\n[37]\n[38]\n[39]\n\nAnother dopamine circuit, the tuberoinfundibular pathway, is primarily responsible for regulating the neuroendocrine secretion of prolactin from the anterior pituitary gland. Although prolactin is best known for its role in lactation, it also contributes to water and salt homeostasis, immune function, and cell-cycle regulation.\n[40]\n[41]\nThe nigrostriatal pathway is the main pathway involved in the motor deficits observed in Parkinson disease.\n[42]\nThis pathway comprises dopaminergic neurons originating in the substantia nigra (pars compacta) and projects to the striatum via the medial forebrain bundle. These neurons form synapses with several neuronal populations at the putamen, caudate nucleus, globus pallidus internus, and the subthalamic nucleus. This elaborated network forms the afferent connections of the substantia nigra to the circuitry involved in motor movement, namely the basal ganglia. In the latter, dopamine plays a pivotal role in controlling motor movement and learning new motor skills.\n[43]\n\nPharmacokinetics\n\nAbsorption:\nDopamine is not effectively absorbed when administered orally because it undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the gastrointestinal tract and liver. Consequently, it must be administered parenterally, typically via continuous intravenous infusion, to achieve therapeutic plasma concentrations. Following intravenous administration, its onset of action is rapid, typically within 5 minutes, reflecting its direct entry into the systemic circulation.\n\nDistribution:\nOnce in circulation, dopamine is rapidly distributed to highly perfused tissues, including the kidneys, mesenteric bed, heart, and vascular smooth muscle. Dopamine's volume of distribution is relatively small, indicating limited tissue penetration beyond extracellular fluid. Importantly, dopamine does not cross the blood-brain barrier in appreciable amounts, so its central dopaminergic effects are minimal when given peripherally.\n\nMetabolism:\nDopamine is extensively metabolized by MAO and catechol-\nO\n-methyltransferase, which are widely distributed in the liver, kidneys, and plasma.\n[44]\nThese enzymatic pathways convert dopamine into inactive metabolites, including homovanillic acid and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid. Due to its rapid metabolism, dopamine has a very short plasma half-life of approximately 2 minutes. Therefore, it requires continuous infusion to maintain therapeutic effects.\n\nExcretion:\nThe metabolites of dopamine are excreted mainly in the urine, with more than 80% eliminated within 24 hours. Only trace amounts of unchanged dopamine appear in the urine.",
    "administration": "Available Dosage Forms and Strengths\n\nDopamine hydrochloride injection is available in intravenous solutions at a concentration of 40 mg/mL (5 and 10 mL vials). For stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system, the indication is for continuous intravenous drip administration. The half-life of dopamine in systemic circulation is between 1 and 5 minutes; therefore, slower forms of administration, such as oral administration, are typically ineffective.\n[45]\nInfusion solution in D5W is available at concentrations of 80 mg/100 mL, 160 mg/100 mL, and 320 mg/100 mL.\n\nIn addition to its peripheral sympathetic effects, dopamine is also critical for neurological movement function in Parkinson disease.\n[42]\nL-DOPA administration is via the oral route, and after absorption, a small percentage is transported to the brain, where neurons utilize it in the basal ganglia. L-DOPA is generally administered concomitantly with carbidopa to inhibit the peripheral effects of L-DOPA in the sympathetic nervous system. Carbidopa is a decarboxylase inhibitor that prevents the systemic conversion of L-DOPA to dopamine, which decreases the presentation of common adverse effects such as nausea and emesis.\n[46]\n\nDosage\n\nAccording to the Food and Drug Administration label, the recommended starting dose for adults and pediatric patients is 2 to 5 mcg/kg/min as a continuous intravenous infusion. The infusion rate may be adjusted in increments of 5 to 10 mcg/kg/min based on hemodynamic response. The maximum recommended dose is 50 mcg/kg/min.\n\nDopamine injection is administered only after dilution by intravenous infusion. Dopamine is administered into a large vein using an infusion pump, preferably in an intensive care setting. Before administration, the solution should be inspected for particulate matter or discoloration; do not use if it appears darker or discolored. Higher-concentration solutions (eg, 3200 or 1600 mcg/mL strengths) are recommended for patients requiring fluid restriction. When discontinuing dopamine, the infusion rate should be gradually tapered according to the patient’s hemodynamic status.\n\nSpecific Patient Populations\n\nHepatic impairment:\nThe hemodynamic profile of acute liver failure resembles that of septic shock, characterized by a hyperdynamic circulation with increased cardiac output, decreased systemic vascular resistance, and reduced effective circulating volume. The American College of Gastroenterology notes that pulse pressure variation may be used to assess fluid responsiveness. However, it requires expertise and further confirmation. When intravenous fluids fail to restore adequate blood pressure, vasopressors should be initiated to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 60 to 80 mm Hg sufficient to achieve a cerebral perfusion pressure. Norepinephrine is recommended as the first-line agent due to its survival benefit and lower risk of adverse outcomes.\n[47]\n\nRenal impairment:\nLimited data are available; dopamine should be used with caution. However, due to its short half-life, the effect is likely minimal.\n\nPregnancy considerations:\nThere are no adequate human data on the use of dopamine in pregnancy, although animal studies have shown developmental toxicity at exposures lower than those used clinically. Because untreated maternal shock is life-threatening, dopamine should not be withheld if considered essential for maternal survival. Concomitant use with oxytocic drugs may precipitate severe maternal hypertension and should therefore be approached with caution.\n\nBreastfeeding considerations:\nCaution is advised when administering to lactating women, and no information is available on its use during breastfeeding. Due to its poor oral bioavailability and short half-life, dopamine in milk is unlikely to affect the infant. Although dopamine reduces serum prolactin in non-nursing women, its effect on milk production in nursing mothers is unknown.\n[48]\n\nPediatric patients:\nDopamine has been used in neonates, infants, children, and adolescents, with weight-based dosing generally comparable to adults. The adverse event profile is similar to that observed in adults. However, inadvertent infusion into the umbilical artery has resulted in serious complications, including vasospasm and ischemia, and must be avoided. The Surviving Sepsis Guidelines recommend using epinephrine or norepinephrine instead of dopamine in pediatric patients with septic shock (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).\n[49]\n\nOlder patients:\nClinical studies involving patients aged 65 or older have been limited; however, existing data suggest that responses are similar to those in younger adults. Older patients are more likely to have impaired liver, kidney, or heart function; dopamine should be started at the lower end of the dose range and be carefully titrated.",
    "adverse_effects": "Dopamine administration affects kidney function, causing increased urinary flow and arrhythmias.\n[50]\nExcessive administration may lead to serious conditions, such as cerebrovascular accidents, due to increased blood pressure.\n[51]\nAs previously stated, the neurotransmitter dopamine also acts centrally within the mesocorticolimbic pathway, playing roles in processing reward and fear, as well as focusing attention and executive functioning, including complex planning.\n[37]\n[38]\nAlthough systemic dopamine does not cross the blood-brain barrier, central dopamine carries implications in somnolence, schizophrenia, addiction, and impulse control disorders.\n[18]\n[33]\n[52]\nPatients with neurologic conditions using high doses of L-DOPA for Parkinson disease may experience physiological alterations due to the dysregulation of dopamine within the CNS pathways.\n\nDrug-Drug Interactions\n\nMAO inhibitors:\nDopamine is metabolized by MAO. The inhibition of dopamine metabolism by MAO results in prolonged effects, increasing the risk of severe hypertension and arrhythmias. In patients receiving MAO inhibitors within the past 2 to 3 weeks, the initial dopamine dose should be reduced to one-tenth of the usual starting dose. Examples of such inhibitors include phenelzine, rasagiline, selegiline, and linezolid.\n[53]\n\nTricyclic antidepressants:\nConcomitant administration may increase dopamine's cardiovascular effects, particularly hypertension. Blood pressure should be closely monitored in patients receiving agents such as amitriptyline, doxepin, imipramine, or nortriptyline.\n\nOther vasopressors:\nCombined use with agents such as norepinephrine, epinephrine, and oxytocin may produce severe hypertension due to additive vasoconstriction. Monitor blood pressure and titrate therapy cautiously.\n[54]\nAntipsychotics:\nHaloperidol may block the systemic effects of dopamine.\nPhenytoin:\nThe anticonvulsant phenytoin may cause hypotension and decreased heart rate when used concomitantly with dopamine.\n\nHalogenated anesthetics:\nConcurrent use may increase myocardial sensitivity and autonomic irritability, predisposing to ventricular arrhythmias and hypertension. Monitor cardiac rhythm when dopamine is given with agents such as desflurane, sevoflurane, or isoflurane.\n[55]",
    "monitoring": "Monitoring of blood pressure and urine flow is necessary. Additionally, assessing more advanced hemodynamic parameters, such as cardiac output, including rhythm and pulmonary wedge pressure, is also recommended. Importantly, dopamine agonists and mimetics that cross the blood-brain barrier interact with the neurological circuitry involved in motor, executive, and limbic functions, including addiction-linked reward systems, impulse control mechanisms, and arousal. Thus, the cessation of dopamine therapies may lead to a condition called dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome. This condition has wide-ranging symptoms, including anxiety, depression, panic attacks, fatigue, hypotension, nausea, irritability, and even suicidal ideation.\n[59]\nTherefore, it is recommended to taper patients off these centrally acting dopamine agonists.",
    "toxicity": "Signs and Symptoms of Overdose or Toxicity\n\nAccording to\nSax's Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials\n(by Richard J. Lewis, 2004; DOI: 10.1002/0471701343), studies in rodents showed an LD50 (a lethal dose in 50% of subjects) between 59 and 163 mg/kg. In humans, dopamine can lead to peripheral vasoconstriction, resulting in gangrenous extremities and cardiac arrhythmias.\n[60]\n[61]\n[62]\nAdditionally, it can cause severe hypertension, tachycardia, confusion, and agitation.\n\nManagement of Overdose or Toxicity\n\nThere is no specific antidote for a dopamine overdose. If an overdose occurs, discontinue the infusion immediately. Symptoms typically resolve quickly due to dopamine's short half-life. If they persist, an alpha-adrenergic blocker such as phentolamine may be administered. Phentolamine can also be used to treat tissue necrosis resulting from dopamine extravasation.\n[63]\nDopamine extravasation leads to intense local alpha-1-mediated vasoconstriction, ischemia, and potential necrosis. Phentolamine, a nonselective α-adrenergic antagonist, blocks these receptors, reversing vasoconstriction and restoring perfusion. Phentolamine is administered subcutaneously around the site of extravasation to prevent or treat ischemic injury. Topical nitroglycerin and subcutaneous terbutaline can be used as alternatives if phentolamine is unavailable or contraindicated.\n[64]"
