The proposed mechanism involves opposing pharmacodynamic action on muscarinic receptor sites in ocular tissue. This interaction is sometimes desirable and is the basis for using atropine in the treatment of excessive muscarinic side effects and cholinergic crisis induced by cholinergic overdose.",

      "effect": "Agents with anticholinergic properties (e.g., sedating antihistamines; antispasmodics; neuroleptics; phenothiazines; skeletal muscle relaxants; tricyclic antidepressants; disopyramide) may have additive effects when used in combination.  Excessive parasympatholytic effects may result in paralytic ileus, hyperthermia, heat stroke, and the anticholinergic intoxication syndrome.  Peripheral symptoms of intoxication commonly include mydriasis, blurred vision, flushed face, fever, dry skin and mucous membranes, tachycardia, urinary retention, and constipation.  Central symptoms may include memory loss, disorientation, incoherence, hallucinations, psychosis, delirium, hyperactivity, twitching or jerking movements, stereotypy, and seizures.  Central nervous system-depressant effects may also be additively or synergistically increased when these agents are combined, especially in elderly or debilitated patients.  Use of neuroleptics in combination with other neuroleptics or anticholinergic agents may increase the risk of tardive dyskinesia.  In addition, some neuroleptics and tricyclic antidepressants may cause prolongation of the QT interval and theoretically, concurrent use of two or more drugs that can cause QT interval prolongation may result in additive effects and increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias including torsade de pointes and sudden death.",

Patients should be advised to notify their physician promptly if they experience potential symptoms of anticholinergic intoxication such as abdominal pain, fever, heat intolerance, blurred vision, confusion, and/or hallucinations.  Ambulatory patients should be counseled to avoid activities requiring mental alertness until they know how these agents affect them.

These changes, although statistically significant, were not considered clinically important.  There were also no serious adverse events, laboratory or ECG abnormalities, or clinically significant alterations in vital signs throughout the study.  Likewise, in 10 healthy subjects, the nonspecific CYP450 inhibitor cimetidine (800 mg orally once a day for 3 days) increased the AUC of ziprasidone (40 mg single oral dose) by just 6% compared to when ziprasidone was administered alone.

      "effect": "Due to its significant bradycardic effects, the risk of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes arrhythmia may be increased during initiation of siponimod treatment in patients receiving drugs that prolong the QT interval. Coadministration of siponimod with antineoplastic, immunosuppressive, or other immune-modulating therapies may increase the risk of unintended additive immunosuppressive effects. Siponimod causes reversible sequestration of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues. When administered daily, siponimod produces a dose-dependent reduction in peripheral lymphocyte count to 20% to 30% of baseline values, which may increase the risk of infections.",
      "management_text": "Siponimod has not been studied in patients receiving drugs that can prolong the QT interval. Because bradycardia and AV block are recognized risk factors for QT prolongation and torsade de pointes arrhythmia, treatment with siponimod should generally not be initiated in patients who are concurrently treated with QT prolonging drugs with known arrhythmogenic properties. Advice from a cardiologist should be sought if treatment with siponimod is considered in patients on concurrent therapy with QT prolonging drugs with a known risk of torsades de pointes or drugs that slow heart rate or AV conduction. The safety and efficacy of siponimod in combination with antineoplastic, immunosuppressive, or immune-modulating agents have not been evaluated. Caution is advised during coadministration and for 3 to 4 weeks after the last dose of siponimod. When switching from drugs with prolonged immune effects to siponimod, the half-life and mode of action of these drugs must be considered to avoid unintended additive immunosuppressive effects while at the same time minimizing risk of disease reactivation.",

A fatal overdose may occur following the initiation of a CYP450 3A4 inhibitor in patients already receiving hydrocodone. Patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of sedation, respiratory depression, and hypotension. Following discontinuation of the CYP450 3A4 inhibitor, patients should be monitored for reduced efficacy of hydrocodone or development of withdrawal symptoms due to reduced plasma hydrocodone levels.",
