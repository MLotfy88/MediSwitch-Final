The mechanism is inhibition of MAO-A, the enzyme responsible for metabolizing exogenous amines such as tyramine in the gut and preventing them from being absorbed intact.  Once absorbed, tyramine is metabolized to octopamine, a substance that is believed to displace norepinephrine from storage granules.  Although selegiline is considered a selective inhibitor of MAO-B, the selectivity may not be absolute even at recommended dosages.','Tyrosine-rich foods','Major','Patients treated with oral selegiline and transdermal selegiline (greater than 6 mg/24 hour) should preferably avoid consumption of products that contain large amounts of amines and protein foods in which aging or breakdown of protein is used to increase flavor.

Caffeine may also precipitate hypertensive crisis so its intake should be minimized as well.  At least 14 days should elapse following discontinuation of selegiline therapy before these foods may be consumed.  Specially designed reference materials and dietary consultation are recommended so that an appropriate and safe diet can be planned.  Patients should also be advised to promptly seek medical attention if they experience potential signs and symptoms of a hypertensive crisis such as severe headache, visual disturbances, difficulty thinking, stupor or coma, seizures, chest pain, unexplained nausea or vomiting, and stroke-like symptoms.

The proposed mechanism is inhibition of CYP450 3A4-mediated first-pass metabolism in the gut wall by certain compounds present in grapefruit.  Because grapefruit juice inhibits primarily intestinal rather than hepatic CYP450 3A4, the magnitude of interaction is greatest for those drugs that undergo significant presystemic metabolism by CYP450 3A4 (i.e., drugs with low oral bioavailability).  In general, the effect of grapefruit juice is concentration-, dose- and preparation-dependent, and can vary widely among brands.  Certain preparations of grapefruit juice (e.g., high dose, double strength) have sometimes demonstrated potent inhibition of CYP450 3A4, while other preparations (e.g., low dose, single strength) have typically demonstrated moderate inhibition.  Pharmacokinetic interactions involving grapefruit juice are also subject to a high degree of interpatient variability, thus the extent to which a given patient may be affected is difficult to predict.','high-fat foods','Moderate','Sonidegib should be administered on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal.

These foods include cheese (particularly strong, aged or processed cheeses), sour cream, wine (particularly red wine), champagne, beer, pickled herring, anchovies, caviar, shrimp paste, liver (particularly chicken liver), dry sausage, salamis, figs, raisins, bananas, avocados, chocolate, soy sauce, bean curd, sauerkraut, yogurt, papaya products, meat tenderizers, fava bean pods, protein extracts, yeast extracts, and dietary supplements.  Caffeine may also precipitate hypertensive crisis so its intake should be minimized as well.  At least 14 days should elapse following discontinuation of MAOI therapy before these foods may be consumed.  Specially designed reference materials and dietary consultation are recommended so that an appropriate and safe diet can be planned.  Patients should be advised to promptly seek medical attention if they experience potential signs and symptoms of a hypertensive crisis such as severe headache, visual disturbances, difficulty thinking, stupor or coma, seizures, chest pain, unexplained nausea or vomiting, and stroke-like symptoms.
