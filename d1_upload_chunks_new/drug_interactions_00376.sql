Deutetrabenazine is not recommended for use in patients with congenital long QT syndrome or with arrhythmias associated with a prolonged QT interval. If concomitant use is required, assessment of baseline QT interval and periodic monitoring during therapy may be considered. In addition, dosage reduction may be considered in patients on concurrent therapy with a strong CYP450 2D6 inhibitor, or in patients who are poor metabolizers of CYP450 2D6.', 'Metabolism, Synergism', 'Coadministration of deutetrabenazine with other drugs that can prolong the QT interval should generally be avoided.', 'Moderate', 'pharmacodynamic', NULL, 'https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/37756/', '', 'Tinidazole, Tetracycline, Cefepime, Cefuroxime, Secnidazole, Cefixime, Amikacin, Rifamycin, Kanamycin, Ampicillin, Acyclovir, More', 'Dextromethorphan, Dalfampridine, Sodium oxybate, Riluzole, Inotersen, Amifampridine, Tafamidis', 1767369485);
