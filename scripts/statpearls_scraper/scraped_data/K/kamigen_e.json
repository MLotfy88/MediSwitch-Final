    "clinical_significance": "Headaches, neck pain, and other musculoskeletal complaints are among the most common reasons for ED and office visits. First-line treatment typically includes NSAIDs, heat, ice, muscle relaxants, and other non-invasive procedures such as massage therapy and physical therapy. Knowledge of OMT techniques, especially suboccipital release, gives providers another option for patients who need or want more than just medications for their ailments. This short and simple technique can help with patient comfort, treatment compliance, and overall quality of life for acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain patients."
