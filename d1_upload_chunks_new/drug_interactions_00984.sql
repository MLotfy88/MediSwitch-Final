Coadministration makes hypotension and hypovolemia more likely than does either drug alone. Some ACE inhibitors may attenuate the increase in the urinary excretion of sodium caused by some loop diuretics. Some patients on diuretics, especially those on dialysis or a dietary salt restriction, may experience acute hypotension with lightheadedness and dizziness after receiving the first dose of the ACE inhibitor. In addition, ACE inhibitors may cause renal insufficiency or acute renal failure in patients with sodium depletion or renal artery stenosis.', 'DDInter', 'Monitoring of blood pressure, diuresis, electrolytes, and renal function is recommended during coadministration. The possibility of first-dose hypotensive effects may be minimized by initiating therapy with small doses of the ACE inhibitor, or either discontinuing the diuretic temporarily or increasing the salt intake approximately one week prior to initiating an ACE inhibitor.

The proposed mechanism is NSAID-induced inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis, which results in unopposed pressor activity producing hypertension. In addition, NSAIDs can cause fluid retention, which also affects blood pressure. Concomitant use of NSAIDs and ACE inhibitors may also cause deterioration in renal function, particularly in patients who are elderly or volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy) or have compromised renal function. Acute renal failure may occur, although effects are usually reversible.
