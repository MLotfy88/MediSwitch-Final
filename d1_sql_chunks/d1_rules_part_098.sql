When choosing an oral contraceptive, consider choosing an ethinyl estradiol-levonorgestrel product as this combination has been studied with letermovir and no clinically significant interaction has been found.', 'Metabolism', 'Monitor estrogen/progestin therapy for altered pharmacologic response and adjust dosage(s) accordingly whenever letermovir is added to or withdrawn from therapy.', NULL, NULL, 'Moderate', 'pharmacodynamic');
