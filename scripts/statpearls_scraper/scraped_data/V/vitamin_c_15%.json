    "indications": "Vitamin C supplementation is contraindicated in blood disorders like thalassemia, G6PD deficiency, sickle cell disease, and hemochromatosis. Avoid taking supplements immediately before or following angioplasty. Diabetic patients should take vitamin C supplements with care as it raises blood sugar levels.\n\nVitamin C should be used cautiously in oxalate nephropathy or nephrolithiasis as acidification by ascorbic acid increases the chances of precipitation of cysteine, urate, and oxalate stones.",
    "mechanism": "Absorption is through an energy-dependent process that has two mechanisms: simple diffusion and active transport. Two transporters are involved: SVCTs (sodium-dependent vitamin C transporters) and hexose transporters. The site for absorption is the distal small intestine and is regulated by renal excretion. Usual dietary doses of up to 100 mg/day are almost completely absorbed. The highest ascorbic acid concentrations are in the pituitary gland, the adrenal gland, the brain, leukocytes, and the eyes.\n\nAscorbic acid functions as a cofactor, enzyme complement, co-substrate, and a powerful anti-oxidant in various reactions and metabolic processes. It also stabilizes vitamin E and folic acid and enhances iron absorption. It neutralizes free radicals and toxins as well as attenuates inflammatory response, including sepsis syndrome.",
    "administration": "Usually administered orally,  the drug may be administered intramuscularly, intravenously (IV), or subcutaneously when malabsorption is suspected. For IV injection, minimize adverse reactions by diluting the drug with normal saline or glucose.\n\nThe average protective adult dose of vitamin C is 70 to 150 mg daily. Increase the dose to 300 mg to 1 g daily when scurvy is present.",
    "adverse_effects": "Adverse effects include headaches, flushing, nausea or vomiting, and dizziness (IV use). There are reports of migraine headaches with a daily dose of 6 g.\n\nSignificant amounts of vitamin C can increase the risk of kidney stones and elevate uric acid and oxalate because it acidifies the urine.",
    "monitoring": "Scurvy is largely a clinical diagnosis. Serum ascorbic acid levels may be measured (greater than 11 micromoles/L), but this typically reflects recent dietary intake. Measurement of leukocyte ascorbic acid levels tends to be more accurate, but testing is not widely available. Normochromic normocytic anemia is common due to blood loss, folate deficiency, and iron deficiency.\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n\nTest dichlorophenolindophenol to measure vitamin C level in urine and serum/plasma and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to measure storage level in lymphocytes and tissues.\n\nThe recommended daily intake of vitamin C is 40 to 120 mg, depending on age and gender.\n\nScurvy is treated with ascorbic acid 100 to 300 mg daily until symptoms remit. Clinical improvement is noted within the first 1 to 2 weeks, with a resolution of fatigue, joint swelling, ecchymoses, and gingiva healing. Complete recovery frequently occurs within three months.",
    "toxicity": "Vitamin C (in grams) can give false negative stool guaiac results and is rarely associated with fatal cardiac arrhythmias in patients with iron overload."
