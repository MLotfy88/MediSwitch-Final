Otherwise, a dosage reduction, slower titration, or even discontinuation of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor should be considered. For patients who are already receiving an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor with anticholinergic agents, every attempt should be made to discontinue the latter or substitute them with less anticholinergic alternatives.

Specifically, inhibition of catecholamine-mediated glycogenolysis and glucose mobilization in association with beta-blockade can potentiate insulin-induced hypoglycemia in diabetics and delay the recovery of normal blood glucose levels. Prolonged and severe hypoglycemia may occur, although these events have rarely been reported. Significant increases in blood pressure and bradycardia can also occur during hypoglycemia in diabetics treated with insulin and beta-blockers due to antagonism of epinephrine's effect on beta-2 adrenergic receptors, which leads to unopposed alpha-adrenergic effects including vasoconstriction. Other effects reported with various beta-blockers include decreased glucose tolerance and decreased glucose-induced insulin secretion.",
      "management_text": "In general, cardioselective beta-blockers are considered safer than noncardioselective agents in the treatment of diabetic patients. Patients should be advised of the need for regular blood glucose monitoring and be aware that certain symptoms of hypoglycemia such as tremor and tachycardia may be masked. However, other symptoms such as headache, dizziness, drowsiness, confusion, nausea, hunger, weakness, and perspiration may be unaffected.",

      "management_text": "Given the risk of reduced viral susceptibility and resistance development associated with subtherapeutic antiretroviral drug levels, rifampin should not be administered to patients receiving unboosted saquinavir. Rifampin should also not be administered to patients receiving ritonavir-boosted saquinavir because of the risk of hepatotoxicity. Alternative antimycobacterial agents should be considered in such patients. For treatment of latent tuberculosis (TB) infection, a nine-month regimen of isoniazid may be considered if feasible. For treatment of HIV-related TB, a regimen that includes rifabutin is generally preferred, as rifabutin appears to be as effective as rifampin but is a much less potent inducer of CYP450 3A4. Nonrifamycin-containing regimens may be suboptimal (higher mortality rates; higher rates of treatment failure and relapse; increased adverse effects; longer treatment duration) and are usually not recommended for HIV-related TB except in patients who are intolerant of rifamycins or infected with a rifamycin-resistant isolate. In patients who have not begun antiretroviral therapy at the time TB treatment is initiated, clinicians may also consider using rifampin and postponing antiretroviral therapy. With early HIV disease, it may be reasonable to monitor CD4 cell count and postpone antiretroviral therapy until TB treatment is complete, since there is low risk of HIV disease progression or death during this period. However, the optimal time for starting antiretroviral therapy should be individualized based on initial response to TB treatment and occurrence of side effects. In patients with low CD4 cell counts, clinicians may consider delaying antiretroviral therapy until after the first one or two months of TB therapy, as side effects are common during this multi-drug phase of TB treatment and may overlap with those of antiretroviral medications. Moreover, delaying antiretroviral therapy may ameliorate adherence issues and decrease the frequency and severity of paradoxical reactions (i.e., immune restoration syndromes resembling exacerbation of TB that sometimes occur after initiation of antituberculosis treatment in patients receiving potent antiretroviral therapy). Rifabutin can be substituted approximately 2 weeks before the planned initiation of antiretroviral therapy to allow time for rifampin's enzyme induction effects to wane. In general, treatment of TB in the context of antiretroviral therapy is complex and requires an individualized approach. Experts in the treatment of HIV-related tuberculosis should be consulted, and TB and HIV care providers should work in close coordination throughout treatment.",
