Conversely, anticholinergic agents may negate the already small pharmacologic benefits of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in the treatment of dementia. These agents may also adversely affect elderly patients in general. Clinically significant mental status changes associated with anticholinergic agents can range from mild cognitive impairment to delirium, and patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementia are especially sensitive.",
      "management_text": "Anticholinergic agents should generally be avoided in patients with Alzheimer's disease or other cognitive impairment, regardless of whether they are receiving an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. For patients requiring treatment to counteract adverse effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor therapy (e.g., gastrointestinal intolerance, urinary problems), an agent without anticholinergic properties should be used whenever possible. Otherwise, a dosage reduction, slower titration, or even discontinuation of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor should be considered. For patients who are already receiving an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor with anticholinergic agents, every attempt should be made to discontinue the latter or substitute them with less anticholinergic alternatives. Caution is required, however, since anticholinergic withdrawal may occur. Seizures have been reported following abrupt discontinuation of anticholinergics during acetylcholinesterase inhibitor therapy.",

Patients with preexisting liver disease or elevated baseline liver enzymes (i.e., ALT greater than two times ULN) should not receive leflunomide or teriflunomide. Patients who develop elevated serum ALT greater than three times ULN while receiving these medications should discontinue treatment and be given washout procedures with cholestyramine or activated charcoal to accelerate elimination of leflunomide's active metabolite from plasma, which otherwise may take up to two years. Follow-up monitoring should be conducted at least weekly until the ALT value is within normal range, and washout procedures repeated as necessary.

Patients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience potential signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as fever, rash, itching, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, malaise, right upper quadrant pain, dark urine, pale stools, and jaundice. Baseline and regular monitoring of hepatic function is recommended. Thioguanine therapy should be discontinued if there is evidence of toxic hepatitis or biliary stasis, as reversal of signs and symptoms of liver toxicity have been reported upon withdrawal. Early indications of liver toxicity are signs associated with portal hypertension such as thrombocytopenia out of proportion with neutropenia and splenomegaly. Elevations of liver enzymes have also been reported, but do not always occur.",
