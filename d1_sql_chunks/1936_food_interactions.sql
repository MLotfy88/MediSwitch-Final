These foods include cheese (particularly strong, aged or processed cheeses), sour cream, wine (particularly red wine), champagne, beer, pickled herring, anchovies, caviar, shrimp paste, liver (particularly chicken liver), dry sausage, salamis, figs, raisins, bananas, avocados, chocolate, soy sauce, bean curd, sauerkraut, yogurt, papaya products, meat tenderizers, fava bean pods, protein extracts, yeast extracts, and dietary supplements.  Caffeine may also precipitate hypertensive crisis so its intake should be minimized as well.  At least 14 days should elapse following discontinuation of MAOI therapy before these foods may be consumed.  Specially designed reference materials and dietary consultation are recommended so that an appropriate and safe diet can be planned.  Patients should be advised to promptly seek medical attention if they experience potential signs and symptoms of a hypertensive crisis such as severe headache, visual disturbances, difficulty thinking, stupor or coma, seizures, chest pain, unexplained nausea or vomiting, and stroke-like symptoms.
