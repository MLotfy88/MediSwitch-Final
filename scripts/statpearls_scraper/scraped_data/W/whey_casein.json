    "clinical_significance": "Stunted growth is associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. Although improved early growth is associated with better cognitive results, there might be a trade-off in terms of worse metabolic results.\n[6]\nAccelerated growth in the postnatal period is a trigger for adult disease.\n[2]\nMiddle-aged adults born with a low weight present a higher prevalence of diabetes and obesity and also higher leptin levels and leptin to fat mass ratio than adults born with a healthy weight; therefore, those born with a low weight should be counseled regarding the risks of developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\n[3]\n\nUltimately we know adequate nutrition is imperative for survival. Still, the intricacies in the balancing act between providing sufficient protein, carbohydrates, fats, and micronutrients while not predisposing the individual to an increased risk of developing long term complications are delicate."
