It is a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). Penile erection is a hemodynamic process initiated by the relaxation of smooth muscle in the corpus cavernosum and its associated arterioles. During sexual stimulation, nitric oxide is released from nerve endings and endothelial cells in the corpus cavernosum. Nitric oxide activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase resulting in increased synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the smooth muscle cells of the corpus cavernosum. The cGMP in turn triggers smooth muscle relaxation, allowing increased blood flow into the penis, resulting in erection. The tissue concentration of cGMP is regulated by both the rates of synthesis and degradation via phosphodiesterases (PDEs). The most abundant PDE in the human corpus cavernosum is the cGMPspecific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5); therefore, the inhibition of PDE5 enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP.','["G04BE09"]','[]'),(25779,'Rectoplexil 10 paed.supp.','ريكتوبليكسيل 10 لبوس للاطفال','17','5','Anti-cough.antitussive and expectorant','Guaifenesin+oxomemazine+paracetamol(acetaminophen)+sodium benzoate','Amriya > sanofi aventis','Supp','لبوس','','2','مضاد للسعال ومسكن وخافض للحرارة ويعمل على دعم الجهاز التنفسي والتقليل من اعراض البرد','description an expectorant that also has some muscle relaxing action mechanism of action guaifenesin may act as an irritant to gastric vagal receptors and recruit efferent parasympathetic reflexes that cause glandular exocytosis of a less viscous mucus mi','6221075100103','',1783,'2023-08-13',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(25780,'Rectoswab rectal oint 30 gm','ريكتوسواب مرهم شرجي 30جم','13','','Haemorrhoids','Glyceryl trinitrate','Uniswab','Oint','مرهم','30 gm','1','','','','',1198,'2022-07-08',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'C01DA02',NULL),(25781,'Rednott 0.25mg/ml eye drops 5 ml','ريدنوت 0.25مجم/مل قطرة للعين 5مل','12','','Antihistamine.second-generation','Ketotifen','Rameda > pharopharma','Drops','نقط','0.25mg','1','','about ketotifen second generation h1 antagonist mast cell stabilizer antihistamine. mechanism of action of ketotifen it is a mast cell stabilizer. this inhibit the development of airway hyper reactivity (associated with activation of platelets by paf (pla','6221094102584','',1212,'2022-12-08',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Ketotifen is a benzocycloheptathiophene derivative[A231204] with potent antihistaminic and mast cell stabilizing properties.

Infliximab is produced by a recombinant cell line cultured by continuous perfusion. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) is a key proinflammatory cytokine involved in chronic inflammatory diseases [A31469]. Its hyperactivity and enhanced signalling pathways can be observed in inflammatory diseases where it activates further pro-inflammatory cascades. By binding to both the soluble subunit and the membrane-bound precursor of TNF-α [A106], infliximab disrupts the interaction of TNF-α with its receptors and may also cause lysis of cells that produce TNF-α [A106].

Infliximab was first approved by the FDA in 1998 under the market name Remicade as an intravenous injection. It is indicated for the treatment of various inflammatory disorders such as adult or pediatric Chron''s disease, adult or pediatric ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis in combination with methotrexate, ankylosing spondyliti, psoriatic arthritis, and plaque psoriasis [FDA Label]. In clinical trials, multiple infusions of infliximab displayed in a reduction of signs and symptoms of inflammatory diseases and induction of remission in patients who have had an inadequate response to alternative first-line therapies for that disorder [FDA Label].

Amikacin''s unique property is that it exerts activity against more resistant gram-negative bacilli such as Acinetobacter baumanii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Amikacin also exerts excellent activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacilli from the Enterobacteriaceae family, including Nocardia and some Mycobacterium (M. avium-intracellulare, M. chelonae, and M. fortuitum)[L4680]. M. avium-intracellulare (MAC) is a type of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) found in water and soil. Symptoms of this disease include a persistent cough, fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, and shortness of breath and the coughing up of blood.[L4680]

Several forms of amikacin are used currently, including an intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) injection.[F1949] In September 2018, a liposomal inhalation suspension of this drug was approved by the FDA for the treatment of lung disease caused by Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) bacteria in a small population of patients with the disease who do not respond to traditional treatment.[L4680,L4681]','["S01AA21", "D06AX12", "J01GB06", "J01RA06"]','[]'),(25857,'Reminyl 4mg/ml oral solution 100 ml','ريمينيل 4مجم/مل محلول 100مل','350','','Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor','Galantamine','Janssen cilag','Solution','محلول','4mg','1','','description a benzazepine derived from norbelladine. it is found in galanthus and other amaryllidaceae. galantamine is a cholinesterase inhibitor that has been used to reverse the muscular effects of gallamine triethiodide and tubocurarine and has been st','','',821,'2022-07-26',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Galantamine is a tertiary alkaloid and reversible, competitive inhibitor of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme, which is a widely studied therapeutic target used in the treatment of Alzheimer''s disease.[A1018] First characterized in the early 1950s, galantamine is a tertiary alkaloid that was extracted from botanical sources, such as _Galanthus nivalis_.[A201968] Galantamine was first studied in paralytic and neuropathic conditions, such as myopathies and postpolio paralytic conditions, and for reversal of neuromuscular blockade.[A182993,A201968] Following the discovery of its AChE-inhibiting properties, the cognitive effects of galantamine were studied in a wide variety of psychiatric disorders such as mild cognitive impairment, cognitive impairment in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and autism; however, re-development of the drug for Alzheimer’s disease did not commence until the early 1990s due to difficulties in extraction and synthesis.[A201968] Galantamine blocks the breakdown of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, thereby increasing acetylcholine neurotransmission. It also acts as an allosteric modulator of the nicotinic receptor, giving its dual mechanism of action clinical significance.[A182993]

The drug was approved by the FDA in 2001 for the treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer''s type.

Also known as the brand name product Narcan, naloxone is currently available by intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (SubQ) injection, nasal spray, or intravenous (IV) infusion.[L33729,L33739] Naloxone IM injections are commonly available in the form of "kits", which is ideal for making overdose treatment accessible and readily available for administration by minimally trained individuals within the community.[L33734] Kits commonly include the supplies necessary to treat an overdose in a non-medical setting such as alcohol swabs, syringes, a rescue breathing mask, and instructions for use. Frequently also carried by medical and emergency personnel and at events known to be associated with heavy drug use like music festivals, naloxone kits are considered a key component of harm reduction strategies.

When injected intramuscularly (IM), naloxone acts within three to five minutes. Administration of naloxone is associated with very few side effects. Notably, if injected into a person not currently using opioid medications, there would be no noticeable effects at all. However, for individuals using opioid medications or experiencing an overdose, IM injection of naloxone rapidly reverses opioid effects and can cause the injected individual to immediately experience withdrawal symptoms.[A234589] Common symptoms of opioid withdrawal include nausea, vomiting, sweating, runny nose, aches, and diarrhea.[A234589] Although certainly physically uncomfortable, opioid withdrawal symptoms are not life-threatening; administration of naloxone is therefore appropriate for any person appearing to have any symptoms of an opioid overdose. Due to its short duration of action, persons injected with naloxone should be monitored for responsiveness and potentially injected a second time or taken to the hospital.[A234589]

Naloxone is also available within the combination product Suboxone with the opioid medication [buprenorphine].[L33714,L33719] Suboxone is used for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence and addiction.[L33714,L33719] When taken orally, naloxone has no pharmacological effect and does not reduce the effectiveness of the opioid effect of buprenorphine.[L33714,L33719] The primary purpose of including naloxone within Suboxone is to act as a deterrent to injection, as injected naloxone would rapidly reverse the effects of buprenorphine.[L33714,L33719]

Naloxone was granted FDA approval on 13 April 1971.[L33709]','["A06AH04", "N02AA53", "V03AB15", "N02AA55", "N02AX51"]','[]'),(25908,'Rescuvita 20 s.g. caps.','ريسكيوفيتا 20 كبسول','70','','Multivitamins','Wheat germ oil+bee pollen+bee propolis+yeast','Arab caps > egypharma-egypt','Cap','كبسولة','','2','','','','',938,'2022-07-25',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(25909,'Resept soap 80 gm','ريسيبت صابونة 80 جم','60','48','Soap','','Hi-care > roventis pharma','Soap','صابون','80 gm','1','مضادة للفطرياتوالبكتيريا ومنظفة للجلد','*properties 1. powerful antimicrobials that provide a trusted protection and clean skin through chloroxylenol triclosan and chlorhexidine 2. unique blend of moisturizers that keep skin healthy and moisturized through aloe vera pine oil & lavender. a*indic','6224000201869','',1123,'2025-03-03',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(25910,'Reserva 200 mg 60 caps.','ريسيرفا 200مجم 60 كبسولة','156','','Cvs','Trans-reservatrol','Rameda','Cap','كبسولة','200 mg','6','مضاد للاورام السرطانية -- high cholesterol, cancer, heart disease, and many other conditions.','indication: to enhance the cardiovascular health. dosage: one capsule to be taken once daily.','','',649,'2022-08-02',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(25911,'Resinokaten 454g powder','ريزينوكاتن 454 جرام باودر','679','338','Potassium binders','Sodium polystyrene sulphonate','Marcyrl co.','Powder','بودرة','','1','','*potassium binders are medications that bind potassium ions in the gastrointestinal tract thereby preventing its intestinal absorption. they consist of polystyrene sulfonate resins attached to a cation and are administered either orally or by retention en','6223003579517','',3548,'2025-06-24',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(25912,'Resolor 1 mg 28 f.c. tabs.','ريسولور 1 مجم 28 قرص','425','321','Laxative','Prucalopride','Janssen cilag > soficopharm','Tab','أقراص','1 mg','4','ملين -- علاج الامساك الشديد -- تقليل التقلصات المعدة -- تقليل الانتفاخات والغازات','','','',2231,'2024-12-10',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Prucalopride is a dihydrobenzofurancarboxamide derivative from the benzofurane family that selectively stimulates 5-HT4 receptors and thus, it presents enterokinetic properties.[A37348] The high selectivity of prucalopride allowed further development as it prevented the cardiac adverse reactions observed due to non-target effects of precedent therapies.[A40254] Prucalopride was developed by Shire Development LLC and approved for use in Europe in 2009,[A40250] in Canada on December 7, 2011 and by the FDA on December 17, 2018.[L4880]','["A06AX05"]','[]');

The result of doing so allows cGMP present in both the penis and pulmonary vasculature to elicit smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation that subsequently facilitates relief in pulmonary arterial hypertension and the increased flow of blood into the spongy erectile tissue of the penis that consequently allows it to grow in size and become erect and rigid [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

Interestingly enough, it is precisely via this mechanism why sildenafil was at first researched as a potential treatment for angina - or chest pain associated with inadequate blood flow to the heart - before being serendipitously indicated for treating erectile dysfunction in the late 1980s [A175732]. Nevertheless, it is because of this mechanism that sildenafil is also indicated for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension but is also additionally notorious for interacting with various anti-anginal or anti-hypertensive agents to develop potentially rapid, excessive, and/or fatal hypotensive crises [A175579, A175582, A175654].

Regardless, sildenafil, among a variety of other similar or related PDE5 inhibitors, has become a common and effective treatment for erectile dysfunction and since its formal approval for medical use in the public in 1998 [A175732], continues to see millions of prescriptions written for it internationally. Although the medication has historically been most popularly recognized as Pfizer''s brand name Viagra, sildenafil is currently available generically and even as a non-prescription over the counter medication in some countries [L5656].','["G01AE10", "G04BE03"]','[]'),(25918,'Respenzo 600 mg 10 f.c.tabs.','ريسبنزو 600مجم 10 اقراص','206','144','Antibiotic.oxazolidinone','Linezolid','Sigma > hochster pharmaceutical industries','Tab','أقراص','600 mg','1','مضاد حيوي','about linezolid oxazolidinone derivative reversible nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitor antibiotic. mechanism of action of linezolid linezolid binds to the 23 s fraction of 50 s ribosome and inhibit the formation of 70s initiation complex. indication','6224007751138','',2833,'2024-07-30',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Linezolid is a synthetic antibiotic which is used for the treatment of infections caused by aerobic Gram-positive bacteria.

It is primarily used for the treatment of respiratory, enteric and genitourinary infections and may be used instead of other macrolides for some sexually transmitted and enteric infections. It is structurally related to erythromycin [A174169].

Azithromycin [9-deoxo-9a-aza-9a-methyl-9a-homoerythromycin] is a part of the _azalide_ subclass of macrolides, and contains a 15-membered ring, with a methyl-substituted nitrogen instead of a carbonyl group at the 9a position on the aglycone ring, which allows for the prevention of its metabolism. This differentiates azithromycin from other types of macrolides [A174175].

In March 2020, a small study was funded by the French government to investigate the treatment of COVID-19 with a combination of azithromycin and the anti-malaria drug [hydroxychloroquine]. The results were positive, all patients taking the combination were virologically cured within 6 days of treatment, however, larger studies are required.[A192546]','["J01RA07", "S01AA26", "J01FA10"]','[]'),(25952,'Revi 2 cream 50 gm','ريفي 2 كريم 50 جرام','75','','Moisturizing topicals','Panthenol+dimethicone+chamomile extract+glycerin+vitamin a+vitamin e+olive oil+almond oil','Macro group pharmaceuticals','Cream','كريم','50 gm','1','كريم مرطب للجلد','- an ultra- rich with vitamins natural extracts & oils for optimum care of dry & irritated skin. - unique formula that contains antimicrobial & soothing ingredients. - helps in management & prevention of diaper rash skin dryness nipple fissures & cases of','6224000437251','',4136,'2023-02-20',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(25953,'Revia 50 mg scored 30 f.c.tabs.(n/a)','ريفيا 50 مجم 30 قرص','300','','Analgesics.narcotic opioid','Naltrexone','Bristol-myers squibb > tchero international ltd.','Tab','أقراص','50 mg','3','','about naltrexone an opioid receptor(competitive antagonists at ?- and ?- receptor) antagonist in alcohol dependence and opioid dependence. mechanism of action of naltrexone naltrexone is a competitive opioid antagonist. it reversibly and completely blocks','','',1527,'2022-07-25',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Derivative of noroxymorphone that is the N-cyclopropylmethyl congener of naloxone.

It is reported that ribavirin might be only effective in early stages of viral hemorrhagic fevers including Lasser fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever, and Hantavirus infection.

According to 2017 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and 2015 consensus guidelines from the Canadian Association for the Study of the Liver (CASL), ribavirin is typically used as an adjunct therapy to various first-line and second-line combination therapies recommended for each genotypes. Ribavirin is added to decrease relapse rates by accelerating viral clearance early in the treatment course [A19645]. When used to treat Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, it is always used as a part of combination therapies as ribavirin monotherapy is not efficacious in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection [A19644]. Additionally, including ribavirin in the regimen can increase the risk of anemia.

The dual therapy was administered for 48 weeks in patients with genotype 1, 4, 5, and 6, and 24 weeks in patients with genotype 2 and 3 [A19626]. Newer drugs developed as Hepatitis C viral infection treatments can be used to reduce or eliminate the use of ribavirin, which are associated with serious adverse effects. They also improve therapeutic efficacy in patients with failed [DB00008]/[DB00022] and ribavirin-based therapy. The potential use of ribavirin as a treatment for acute myeloid leukemia is currently under investigation.

According to 2017 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and 2015 consensus guidelines from the Canadian Association for the Study of the Liver (CASL), ribavirin is typically used as an adjunct therapy to various first-line and second-line combination therapies recommended for each genotypes. Ribavirin is added to decrease relapse rates by accelerating viral clearance early in the treatment course [A19645]. When used to treat Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, it is always used as a part of combination therapies as ribavirin monotherapy is not efficacious in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection [A19644]. Additionally, including ribavirin in the regimen can increase the risk of anemia.

It is primarily indicated for use in treating hepatitis C and viral hemorrhagic fevers. HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. It is reported that ribavirin might be only effective in early stages of viral hemorrhagic fevers including Lasser fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever, and Hantavirus infection. Ribavirin is a prodrug that is metabolized into nucleoside analogs that blocks viral RNA synthesis and viral mRNA capping. Before the development of newer drugs, ribavirin and [DB00008]/[DB00022] dual therapy was considered the first-generation and standard antiviral treatment [A19626]. The dual therapy was administered for 48 weeks in patients with genotype 1, 4, 5, and 6, and 24 weeks in patients with genotype 2 and 3 [A19626]. Newer drugs developed as Hepatitis C viral infection treatments can be used to reduce or eliminate the use of ribavirin, which are associated with serious adverse effects. They also improve therapeutic efficacy in patients with failed [DB00008]/[DB00022] and ribavirin-based therapy. The potential use of ribavirin as a treatment for acute myeloid leukemia is currently under investigation.

According to 2017 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and 2015 consensus guidelines from the Canadian Association for the Study of the Liver (CASL), ribavirin is typically used as an adjunct therapy to various first-line and second-line combination therapies recommended for each genotypes. Ribavirin is added to decrease relapse rates by accelerating viral clearance early in the treatment course [A19645]. When used to treat Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, it is always used as a part of combination therapies as ribavirin monotherapy is not efficacious in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection [A19644]. Additionally, including ribavirin in the regimen can increase the risk of anemia. 

In HCV genotye 1/2/3/4/5/6 patients, ribavirin can be used in combination therapy involving [DB09102] and [DB08934], Eplusa ([DB08934], [DB11613]), Harvoni ([DB08934], [DB09027]), [DB06290] and [DB08934], Viekira Pak ([DB09296], [DB09297], [DB00503], [DB09183]), Technivie ([DB00503], [DB09296], [DB09297]) and Zepatier ([DB11574], [DB11575]). Addition of weight-based ribavirin to Technivie therapy increased sustained virologic response after 12 weeks of daily therapy (SVR12) from 90% to 97% in patients with HCV genotype 1a and 90.9% to 100% in HCV genotype 4 patients [L852]. Zepatier therapy along with ribavirin improved SVR in HCV genotype 5 patients.
