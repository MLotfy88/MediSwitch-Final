    "indications": "Absolute contraindications to corticosteroid injections include local infection and bacteremia. If the infusion is intra-articular, absolute contraindications would also include septic arthrosis and intra-articular fracture. In the setting of biceps tendon sheath injection, it should be noted that the biceps tendon sheath communicates with the glenohumeral joint. Therefore, medication injected into the biceps tendon sheath also extends to the joint. If the clinical indication is to assess for septic arthrosis or tenosynovitis, one must carefully evaluate the overlying soft tissues for signs of cellulitis. It is crucial to avoid contamination of the joint or tendon sheath by placing the needle through infected soft tissue before accessing the joint. Relative contraindications include local or juxta-articular osteoporosis, coagulopathy, or recent injection or multiple frequent injections, defined as 3 or more injections over the last year or within the prior 6 weeks.\n[17]"
