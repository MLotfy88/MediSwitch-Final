    "toxicity": "Management of enophthalmos, whether medical, surgical, or reconstructive, may have adverse effects that can affect functional and cosmetic outcomes. Understanding and mitigating such complications remains integral to comprehensive care. Adverse effects may arise from pharmacologic agents, operative techniques, implant materials, or radiation-related fibrosis and require preventive strategies, vigilant monitoring, and early interprofessional management to limit long-term morbidity and optimize restoration of orbital volume and symmetry.\n\nToxicity Due to Pharmacological Treatment\n\nMedical therapy provides supportive benefit rather than definitive correction in enophthalmos, yet several pharmacologic agents used for associated inflammation, fibrosis, or radiation injury carry risks of systemic or local toxicity. Systemic corticosteroids used for posttraumatic or postinflammatory fibrosis may trigger hyperglycemia, hypertension, ocular hypertension, cataract formation, or avascular necrosis. Management relies on intraocular pressure monitoring, dose tapering, and use of topical or periocular routes when feasible. Antifibrotic agents, such as pentoxifylline, tocopherol, or pirfenidone, mitigate radiation-induced fibrosis but may cause gastrointestinal upset, dizziness, hepatotoxicity, or fatigue. Baseline liver function testing, gradual dose escalation, and symptomatic treatment reduce complication rates.\n\nImmunosuppressants, including methotrexate or mycophenolate, support control of autoimmune orbital inflammation but can cause bone marrow suppression, hepatotoxicity, and increased infection risk, warranting monitoring of complete blood count and liver function and avoidance of live vaccines. Topical lubricants and steroids provide ocular surface protection but may induce steroid-related glaucoma or epithelial thinning, requiring preservative-free artificial tears and strict limitation of steroid duration. Hyaluronic acid fillers offer temporary correction for mild enophthalmos but carry risks of nodule formation, vascular occlusion, or, rarely, blindness—injection under imaging guidance and the availability of hyaluronidase support safe use.\n\nSurgical and Implant-Related Adverse Effects\n\nOrbital reconstruction and soft-tissue augmentation remain cornerstone treatments for enophthalmos but carry specific procedural risks. The complexity of orbital anatomy and the proximity to critical structures increase the likelihood of mechanical or neurovascular complications. Overcorrection resulting in exophthalmos may occur due to excessive implant volume or malposition, manifesting as globe protrusion and exposure keratopathy. Management involves early revision or implant adjustment. Undercorrection or residual enophthalmos results from inadequate orbital volume restoration, producing persistent asymmetry, and may require secondary surgery or autologous fat grafting. Diplopia or restrictive strabismus can result from entrapment of extraocular muscles or implant impingement, presenting as double vision and gaze restriction, and managed by forced duction testing and early surgical release.\n\nImplant extrusion or infection may result from inadequate sterilization or tissue reaction, presenting with pain, discharge, or extrusion. Management includes intravenous antibiotics, implant removal, and delayed reconstruction. Orbital hemorrhage from intraoperative vessel injury produces pain, proptosis, and vision loss, necessitating emergency decompression and intravenous steroids. Optic neuropathy may develop from overpacking or direct trauma, causing decreased vision and relative afferent pupillary defect, requiring urgent decompression and high-dose intravenous steroids.\n\nFat Grafting and Tissue Augmentation Complications\n\nAutologous fat transfer is a valuable, minimally invasive option for soft-tissue augmentation; however, complications may arise from graft resorption, necrosis, or migration. Partial resorption, which may reach up to 40%, is managed with repeat micrografting after 6 to 12 months. Fat necrosis and cyst formation may be minimized using the microdroplet technique with layered injection. Contour irregularities are addressed through secondary refinements or hyaluronic acid fillers. Infection or granuloma formation requires treatment with antibiotics or corticosteroid infiltration.\n[78]\nEmerging stem-cell–enriched fat grafting exhibits lower resorption rates and improved biocompatibility, reducing long-term complications.\n\nPostradiation and Fibrosis-Associated Toxicity\n\nPostradiation enophthalmos presents unique challenges due to chronic fibrosis, reduced vascularity, and delayed wound healing. Orbital fibrosis and contracture contribute to progressive globe retraction and lid stiffness. Tissue necrosis may develop in high-dose radiation fields exceeding 60 Gy. Secondary infection or osteoradionecrosis requires early antibiotic prophylaxis and, when indicated, hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Preventive strategies include initiating antifibrotic therapy, combining pentoxifylline and vitamin E, and doing so early in the postradiation phase. Reconstructive surgery should be delayed for 6 to 12 months to allow tissue stabilization. The use of vascularized flaps, such as temporalis fascia, in reconstruction enhances healing and reduces postoperative complications.\n\nAnesthesia and Systemic Risks\n\nRetrobulbar hemorrhage during orbital anesthesia can exacerbate enophthalmos or threaten vision. Systemic reactions to local anesthetics, such as lidocaine toxicity, may manifest as tremor, arrhythmia, or seizures and are managed with intravenous lipid emulsion therapy and supportive care. General anesthesia for orbital reconstruction carries standard perioperative risks, including airway compromise, thromboembolism, and anesthetic sensitivity.\n[79]\n\nPreventive and Monitoring Protocols\n\nPreventive and monitoring protocols for enophthalmos management span preoperative, intraoperative, postoperative, and long-term phases. Preoperatively, comorbidities such as diabetes and thyroid disease should be optimally controlled, patients counseled regarding expectations, and imaging obtained. Baseline assessments include exophthalmometry, visual acuity, and CT scanning. Intraoperative measures focus on avoiding overpacking, ensuring implant sterilization, and maintaining hemostasis, with continuous monitoring of the oculocardiac reflex.\n\nPostoperative strategies aim at early detection of pain, swelling, or diplopia, with prophylactic antibiotics and steroids administered as indicated. Monitoring entails weekly evaluations for 1 month, followed by follow-up imaging at 3 to 6 months. Long-term management addresses fibrosis and soft-tissue atrophy through follow-up interventions, including annual imaging and functional ocular motility testing.\n\nEmerging Strategies for Toxicity Reduction\n\nEmerging strategies for toxicity reduction include the use of bioresorbable implants, which decrease chronic inflammation and lower the risk of extrusion. Three-dimensional navigation during surgery minimizes entrapment of extraocular muscles and undercorrection. Antioxidant and anti-transforming growth factor beta therapies demonstrate potential in mitigating radiation-induced fibrosis. AI–assisted implant design reduces intraoperative trial-and-error, enhancing long-term anatomical stability."
