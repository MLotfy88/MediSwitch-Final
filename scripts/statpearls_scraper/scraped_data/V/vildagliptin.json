    "clinical_significance": "GLP-1 analogs are now used in the management of diabetes.\n[16]\nThese agents can potentiate endogenous insulin release in response to oral glucose loads with only a minor risk of hypoglycemia compared to sulfonylureas. Examples include long-acting GLP-1 agonists such as liraglutide, which are resistant to degradation by the enzyme dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4), and short-acting agonists like lixisenatide. Exenatide, another GLP-1 agonist, is available as both an immediate-release and an extended-release formulation. DPP-4 inhibitors inhibit the degradation of endogenous GLP-1 by DPP-4 and thus increase the half-life of the endogenous product. Examples include sitagliptin, saxagliptin, and linagliptin, among others. The efficacy of linagliptin may be adversely affected by CYP3A4 or P-glycoprotein inducers such as rifampin or St. John’s wort, thus requiring the use of alternative agents that are not pharmacodynamically affected by changes in CYP-450 drug metabolism.\n[17]\nGLP-2 analogs are currently emerging as a treatment for short-bowel syndrome due to their trophic effects on the small intestine.\n[18]\nCurrently, teduglutide, a novel GLP-2 analog, is being tested for use in this condition, seen in patients who have undergone extensive small bowel resection and subsequently lack sufficient small bowel absorptive area to keep up with the production of digestive juices and intake of foods and fluids.\n[19]"
