    "indications": "There are few specific contraindications when it comes to prescribing ruxolitinib; however, there are medications and foods that should be used with caution alongside ruxolitinib. For example, as previously mentioned, grapefruit and grapefruit juice should not be taken alongside ruxolitinib due to possible interaction. Further, when taking potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and voriconazole alongside ruxolitinib, the ruxolitinib dose should be reduced as all these medications cause increased exposure to ruxolitinib. Careful consideration is necessary when fluconazole is taken alongside ruxolitinib as it inhibits both CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 and causes increased exposure to ruxolitinib. Hence, the dose of fluconazole should not exceed 200 mg daily when taken alongside ruxolitinib.\n[13]\n\nOther drug contraindications include concomitant ruxolitinib use with live vaccines.\n\nRuxolitinib is contraindicated in patients whose creatinine clearance is below 15 and who are not on hemodialysis. Patients should not breastfeed during treatment and for two weeks following discontinuation of treatment.\n[18]\n\nClinicians need to exercise caution when prescribing ruxolitinib to patients who smoke or are past smokers, those with a creatinine clearance below 60, patients with hepatic impairment, and those with infection risks, particularly TB-related risk.",
    "mechanism": "Ruxolitinib falls under the drug class known as janus kinase inhibitors (JAK Inhibitors). It is an inhibitor of the JAK1 and JAK2 protein kinases and works by competitively inhibiting the ATP-binding catalytic site on JAK1 and JAK2.\n[4]\nThe result of this inhibition is disruption of cytokine and growth factor signaling pathways, leading to a decrease in proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which are usually elevated in myelofibrosis and other inflammatory conditions. Furthermore, JAK1 is involved in regulating interleukin 2 and 6 and TNF alpha, while JAK2 is involved with many cellular functions that include proliferation and differentiation.\n\nDue to its anti-JAK activity, ruxolitinib has been reported to improve splenomegaly seen in myelofibrosis and other constitutional symptoms such as fevers, pruritus, and night sweats. However, ruxolitinib is not known to alter the actual bone marrow or cause prolonged survival in myelofibrosis.\n[4]\nMoreover, in mice models, ruxolitinib has been shown to reduce inflammation as well as decrease T-cell activation and neutrophil activity.\n[11]\n\nThe drug has a half-life of 3 hours for the parent drug and approximately 6 hours for its active metabolites. It is hepatically metabolized via the CYP450 enzymatic pathway, specifically CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. It is mostly excreted in the urine (75%) and to a lesser extent in the feces (approximately 20%.)\n[12]",
    "administration": "Ruxolitinib is taken orally and is available in 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, and 25 mg tablets. The dosing regimen is based on the patient’s individual situation as well as blood results. For example, when treating myelofibrosis, the dose is dependent on the patient’s baseline platelet counts. Patients with myelofibrosis who have a platelet count between 50 to 100 x 10^9/L can take up to a maximum of 5 mg twice daily, while patients with a platelet count of above 100 x 10^9/L can take a maximum of 15 mg twice daily.\n\nIn contrast, patients with polycythemia vera should be started on 10 mg twice daily as a starting dose. In non-responders dose can be increased to 25 mg twice daily if hemoglobin, neutrophil counts, and platelets are normal. It is important to keep in mind that ruxolitinib should not be taken with grapefruit or grapefruit juice due to possible interaction causing increased exposure to ruxolitinib; however, patients can take it with other food or without depending on patient preference.\n[13]\n\nDosing for acute graft-versus-host disease is 5 to 10 mg orally twice daily, starting a 5 mg twice daily for 3 days, then increasing to 10 mg twice daily. For chronic graft-versus-host disease, the recommended dosing is 10 mg twice daily. Dose adjustments may be necessary for patients who have failed prior treatment based on their bilirubin, ANC, or platelet responses.\n[14]\n\nClinicians need to consult advanced prescribing information in cases of renal or hepatic impairment. In dialysis patients, dosing should be after dialysis on dialysis days.\n[15]\n\nRuxolitinib may also be used in pediatric patients with graft-versus-host disease; dosing is similar to adult dosing, and the clinician should consult package inserts for the most precise dosing and adjustments based on hepatic or renal status in pediatric patients.\n[15]",
    "adverse_effects": "During the COMFORT trials, the most common nonhematologic adverse events included ecchymosis, headache, dizziness, abdominal pain, fatigue, and diarrhea. The most common hematological adverse events seen with ruxolitinib during the trials included anemia and thrombocytopenia due to the inhibition of JAK2, which plays a role in erythropoietin and thrombopoietin signaling.\n[13]\nOther potentially serious hematologic adverse events include anemia and neutropenia.\n\nIt has been reported that patients taking ruxolitinib experience higher rates of herpes zoster infection and basal-cell and squamous-cell carcinomas.\n[16]\nOne study analyzing ruxolitinib in patients with steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease mentioned patients developing anemia, thrombocytopenia, and cytomegalovirus infection while on ruxolitinib.\n[17]",
    "monitoring": "Patients starting or continuing ruxolitinib need to be monitored in multiple domains. Due to the increased risk of infection, all patients require monitoring for signs of infection throughout treatment while taking ruxolitinib. Studies have shown increased rates of urinary tract infections, hepatitis, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and herpes zoster infection; therefore, clinicians should keep this in mind, and patients should be screened for signs of infection.\n[19]\nClinicians should perform tuberculosis screening in high-risk patients to investigate for any active or latent tuberculosis infection prior to starting ruxolitinib treatment.\n\nIt is also recommended to check the patient's complete blood count in individuals with myelofibrosis before starting ruxolitinib and continue to check this every two to four weeks until the dose of ruxolitinib has stabilized. Once drug levels have stabilized, a complete blood count only needs to be done every eight to twelve weeks or when clinical suspicion warrants it.\n[13]",
    "toxicity": "Toxicities that may accompany therapy with ruxolitinib include hematological toxicities, which encompass cytopenia and anemia. In one study looking at the efficacy of ruxolitinib in patients with corticosteroid-refractory graft-versus-host disease when cytopenia occurred, it required a dose reduction, interruption in treatment, or permanent cessation of ruxolitinib.\n[19]\nFurthermore, when patients’ platelet count drops below 50 x 10^9/L with an original baseline greater than 100 x 10^9/L, ruxolitinib needs to be stopped to avoid further toxicity. The same can be said for patients with a baseline platelet count of 50 x 10^9/L that drops below 25 x 10^9/L. Ruxolitinib can be restarted once counts normalize.\n\nAlso, during the COMFORT trials, hemoglobin levels in patients decreased in the first eight to twelve weeks; however, levels improved after twelve weeks. Moreover, patients with renal impairment should reduce their ruxolitinib dose, as should patients with hepatic impairment.\n[13]\nLastly, one study examining the relationship between ruxolitinib and cardiac repolarization found no evidence of ruxolitinib affecting the QT interval.\n[20]"
