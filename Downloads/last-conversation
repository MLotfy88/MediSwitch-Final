Okay, I have the latest code for FilterEndDrawer. Now I'll apply the changes to replace the hardcoded strings with the localized keys.

It seems the apply_diff tool is consistently failing to add the import statement correctly for these files. My apologies for the repeated attempts.

To ensure the changes are applied correctly, I will use the write_to_file tool instead. This will overwrite the file with the complete, localized content, including the necessary import.

First, I need to get the current content of the file to modify it.

Okay, I have the latest content for filter_end_drawer.dart. It seems the previous apply_diff partially succeeded, applying the localization keys but failing to add the import statement, which caused the error.

I will now use write_to_file to ensure the file has the correct import and all the necessary localization changes.

It seems the apply_diff tool is unreliable for applying the import statement along with the other changes in these files. The write_to_file approach worked for FilterEndDrawer, so let's use that for SearchScreen and DrugDetailsScreen as well to fix the remaining errors.

First, I'll fix SearchScreen. I need the current content to modify.

<tool_use>

Okay, I have the latest content for SearchScreen. It seems the import statement was added correctly at line 16 in the previous step, but the errors persisted, possibly due to an inconsistent state in the analysis server.

To be absolutely sure, I will use write_to_file to rewrite the entire SearchScreen with the correct import and localization changes.

Okay, SearchScreen should now be correctly localized.

Now, let's fix DrugDetailsScreen using the same write_to_file approach. I need the current content first.

Okay, I have the latest content for DrugDetailsScreen. I will now use write_to_file to apply all the localization changes, including the import statement.

Okay, it seems the write_to_file operation for DrugDetailsScreen introduced a new error related to TextDirection.ltr. This likely happened because the dart:ui library, which defines TextDirection, wasn't explicitly imported, and the implicit export from material.dart might not be resolving correctly in this context.

Let's fix this by explicitly importing dart:ui with an alias and using that alias.

First, I need the latest file content.

Okay, it seems the previous write_to_file operation for DrugDetailsScreen fixed the localization issues but introduced a new error: The getter 'ltr' isn't defined for the type 'TextDirection'. This usually happens when the dart:ui library isn't properly resolved.

I'll fix this by explicitly importing dart:ui with an alias (ui) and using that alias for TextDirection.ltr. I'll use write_to_file again to ensure the import and the correction are applied correctly.

Okay, DrugDetailsScreen should now be correctly localized and the TextDirection error resolved.

The remaining localization tasks are:

Localize Category Names: Ensure category names displayed in FilterEndDrawer and DrugDetailsScreen are translated. This likely involves using the kCategoryTranslation map from app_constants.dart.
Localize Other Drug Data: Check if fields like dosageForm need localization where displayed (e.g., in DrugDetailsScreen).
Currency Symbol: Ensure "L.E" (l10n.currencySymbol) is used consistently for prices instead of "ج.م".
Let's start by examining lib/core/constants/app_constants.dart to see the kCategoryTranslation map.

<tool_use>

Okay, the kCategoryTranslation map in app_constants.dart looks good. It provides Arabic translations for the English category keys.

Now, let's ensure these translations are used wherever category names are displayed.

HomeScreen (_buildCategoriesSection): Already uses kCategoryTranslation. No changes needed here.
DrugCard (_buildDetailedCard): Already uses kCategoryTranslation. No changes needed here.
FilterEndDrawer (build): Currently displays the raw category keys in the FilterChip labels. This needs to be updated to use the translations.
DrugDetailsScreen (_buildInfoTab): Currently displays the raw mainCategory value. This also needs to be updated to use the translation.
Let's start by fixing FilterEndDrawer. I'll read the file and then apply the change to use kCategoryTranslation.
