      "text": "Almost 100% effective if given <8 hr post-ingestion; less effective if 16-24 hr post-ingestion\nMay still be useful >24 hr post-ingestion, even with fulminant hepatic failure. Give NAC until LFTs improve (not until APAP level is 0)\n[12]\n[13]\nBe aware NAC treatment may affect PT. May see a dose-dependent increase in PT following NAC in patients without hepatotoxicity.\n[14]",
