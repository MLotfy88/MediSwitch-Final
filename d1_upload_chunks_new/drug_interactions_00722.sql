Vital signs should be closely monitored. Patients who have had even a brief interval off clozapine (i.e. 2 or more days since the last dose) should be restarted with 12.5 mg once or twice daily. The potential for additive effects on the QT interval and increased risk of torsade de pointes arrhythmia should also be considered when clozapine is used in combination with phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, some atypical antipsychotics (e.g., asenapine, quetiapine, iloperidone, iloperidone, paliperidone, risperidone, ziprasidone), or other psychotherapeutic agents that can prolong the QT interval such as amoxapine, haloperidol, maprotiline, mirtazapine, and trazodone. Serum electrolytes, including potassium, magnesium and calcium, should be measured at baseline and periodically during treatment, and any abnormalities corrected prior to initiating clozapine. Routine ECG assessment may detect QTc prolongation but is not always effective in preventing arrhythmias. Clozapine treatment should be discontinued if the QTc interval exceeds 500 msec. Patients should be advised to seek prompt medical attention if they experience symptoms that could indicate the occurrence of torsade de pointes such as dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, palpitation, irregular heart rhythm, shortness of breath, or syncope.', 'Synergism', 'Caution is advised when clozapine is initiated in patients receiving other psychotropic drugs.', 'Major', 'pharmacodynamic', NULL, 'https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/72387/', '', 'Amisulpride, Loxapine, Pimavanserin', 'Clozapine', 1767369485);
