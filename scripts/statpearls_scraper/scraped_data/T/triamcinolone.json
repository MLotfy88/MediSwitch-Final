    "indications": "Warnings and Precautions\n\nTriamcinolone injections are strongly contraindicated for epidural administration due to serious medical adverse effects, including paralysis, cortical blindness, and death. Additionally, prolonged use of glucocorticoids may lead to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) suppression.\n[16]\n[17]\nHigh doses of corticosteroids are not recommended in patients with head trauma due to the risk of early mortality. Systemic corticosteroids are not indicated in patients with fungal or viral infections. Contraindications to triamcinolone include patients with tuberculosis due to the risk of reactivation.\n\nPatients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus should use caution when systemically dosing triamcinolone (as with all corticosteroids) due to its hyperglycemic adverse effect. Patients diagnosed with psychosis should also use extreme caution, as triamcinolone may exacerbate related symptoms.\n\nCorticosteroids are known to exacerbate glaucoma; thus, primary care physician supervision is necessary.\n[18]\nDue to its potency, pregnant patients should not use triamcinolone for prolonged durations. Corticosteroid use is contraindicated in children younger than 2. Injectable triamcinolone often contains benzyl alcohol, so its use in neonates should be avoided to prevent potential gasping syndrome.",
    "mechanism": "Triamcinolone is a glucocorticoid in the corticosteroid drug class. It exhibits anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant activity via inhibiting the phospholipase A2 enzyme on the cell membrane phospholipid layer, thereby hindering the breakdown of leukocyte lysosomal membranes and preventing the formation of arachidonic acid.\n[7]\nIt decreases the expression of cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) and thus prevents the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, respectively. Corticosteroids manifest anti-inflammatory effects via inhibiting macrophage and leukocyte migration to the affected site by reversing vascular dilation and permeability. These actions lead to reduced edema, erythema, and pruritus. An important anti-inflammatory mechanism is mediated by the inhibition of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), which leads to decreased protein expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and COX-2.\n[8]\n[9]\n\nPharmacokinetics\n\nAbsorption:\nAbsorption, onset, and duration vary based on dose form.\n\nInjection: IV administration results in rapid and complete absorption.\n[10]\nAfter deep intramuscular injection, triamcinolone acetonide is absorbed slowly, though almost completely. While triamcinolone may be absorbed systemically from synovial spaces, clinically significant systemic levels after intra-articular injection are unlikely except possibly following injection to large joints with high doses.\nOral: The medication has a rapid absorption rate following oral intake; oral ingestion results in 90% absorption. Triamcinolone has a half-life of 18 to 36 hours, and peak triamcinolone concentrations occur within 1.5 to 2 hours following oral administration.\nTopical: Systemic absorption varies based on application area and site, occlusion, and patient-specific characteristics\nNasal spray: This formulation exhibits minimal systemic absorption\n\nDistribution:\nThe duration of triamcinolone varies because it depends on the route of administration. IV administration has been shown to have a volume of distribution of 103L. Oral bioavailability was 23%.\n[10]\n\nMetabolism:\nSystemically absorbed triamcinolone is hepatically metabolized via the CYP450 enzyme system; it is a CYP3A4 substrate.\n\nElimination:\nElimination is via both renal and fecal pathways.",
    "administration": "Available Dosage Forms\n\nTriamcinolone administration can be oral (tablets or capsules), topical (spray, lotion, cream, and ointment), oral or intranasal topical (eg, spray), intramuscular, or via intravitreal injection. Triamcinolone should be taken orally with meals to avoid GI discomfort. When given topically, instructions are to apply a thin layer to the affected area and rub gently. When administered as an inhalation solution, the patient must learn the proper administration technique for the correct dose.\n[11]\n\nAvailable Strengths\n\nThe injectable suspension formulation is available in 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg/mL strengths. The topical lotion, cream, and ointment are available in 0.025%, 0.1%, and 0.5% formulations. The topical spray is available at 0.0147%. There is also a 0.1% dental paste formulation. Triamcinolone should be stored in a cool, dry area at room temperature (68 °F to 77 °F or 20 °C to 25 °C).\n\nAdult Dosing\n\nA list of some regimens for conditions organized by dosage form:\n\nSeasonal allergic rhinitis\n\nIn adults and children ages 12 and older: 220 μg daily via intranasal spray (1 to 2 actuator sprays in each nostril; start with 2 sprays. Do not exceed 2 sprays in each nostril per day.) Discontinue in 3 weeks if there is no improvement.\nIn children:\nAges 2 to 5: 110 μg daily via intranasal spray (1 actuation in each nostril); do not exceed 110 μg (1 actuation) daily in children younger than 6. Discontinue in 3 weeks if there is no improvement.\nAges 6 to 11: 110 μg to 220 μg daily via intranasal spray (1 to 2 actuator sprays in each nostril; start with 1 spray - do not exceed 2 sprays in each nostril per day.) Discontinue in 3 weeks if there is no improvement.\n\nAllergic conditions (hay fever/pollen)\n\nFor adults, 40 to 100 mg IM for a single dose is recommended. The lowest effective dose is used for hay fever or pollen asthma.\n\nAcute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis\n\nIn adults, the recommended dose is 160 to 100 mg IM daily for 1 week, then 64 mg every other day for 1 month. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest effective treatment duration and taper the dose to discontinue therapy.\n\nVarious skin conditions\n\nTreatment for atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, dermatitis herpetiformis, psoriasis, eczema, or lichen planus:\n\nTopical cream or ointment:\nFor adults: apply 0.1% triamcinolone paste 2 or 3 times daily to the affected area after meals.\n\nDermatomyositis or symptomatic sarcoidosis\n\nIM:\nFor adults, the dose ranges between 40 and 80 mg IM daily. Start with 60 mg for 1 dose; use the lowest effective dose. The frequency will vary based on the condition and severity.\nThe dose ranges from 0.11 to 1.6 mg/kg/d for children, divided into 3 or 4 doses.\n\nTopical cream or ointment:\nIn adults, apply 0.025% to 0.05% lotion/cream/ointment or 0.1% to 0.5% cream/ointment 2 or 3 times daily to the affected area.\n\nSteroid responsive dermatoses (including atopic and contact dermatitis)\n\nTopical cream or ointment:\nApply a thin film of 0.025% cream or ointment to the affected areas 2 to 4 times daily.\nInjection: Inject intralesionally or sub-lesional up to 0.5 mg/in\n2\nof affected skin.\n\nSymptomatic relief of rheumatoid arthritis, gouty arthritis, osteoarthritis\n\nIM:\nFor adults, the dose ranges between 40 and 80 mg IM; repeat every 4 weeks.\nFor children, the dose is 40 mg IM; repeat every 4 weeks.\n\nIntra-articular injection and tendon sheaths (including gout)\n\nLarge joints: inject 5 to 15 mg intraarticular once; may need up to 40 mg.\nSmall joints: inject 2.5 to 5 mg intraarticular once; may require up to 10 mg.\nTendon sheaths: inject 2.5 to 10 mg along the sheath 1 time.\n\nSpecial Patient Population\n\nHepatic impairment:\nDosing for hepatic impairment is undefined.\n\nRenal impairment:\nRenal dose adjustments, including for patients on dialysis, are undefined. Caution is advised.\n\nPregnant considerations:\nClinicians must weigh the risks and benefits, especially in the first trimester or with long-term use. Conflicting human data shows a risk of orofacial cleft, possible low birth weight, and premature birth based on limited data from other corticosteroids.\n\nBreastfeeding considerations:\nNo human data is available. However, the risk of infant harm is not expected based on limited data from other similar drugs and triamcinolone's properties. However, there is a potential risk of suppressed infant growth and reduced endogenous steroid production. Based on data from high-dose steroid injections, there is a potential risk of reduced milk production.\n\nPediatric patients:\nSee pediatric dosing above.\n\nOlder patients:\nTo date, no studies have demonstrated specific problems affecting older patients that would limit the use of triamcinolone injection in this patient population. However, older patients are more sensitive to triamcinolone's effects than younger adults, especially osteoporosis. A higher incidence of skin atrophy is noted with glucocorticoid use in older patients.",
    "adverse_effects": "Common adverse effects associated with the initial use of topical triamcinolone involve itchiness, burning, irritation, or skin drying.\n[12]\nThese symptoms resolve on their own within a few days of use. Other adverse effects may include headaches, dizziness, edema of the ankles or feet, or changes in urination or vision.\n\nChronic use of glucocorticoids such as triamcinolone may cause Cushing syndrome or Cushingoid appearance. Other effects include hypertension, weight gain, acne, striae, thinning of the dermal skin layer, osteoporosis, hyperglycemia, amenorrhea, immunosuppression, and steroid psychosis (eg, depression or mania).\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\nOther adverse effects include those associated with all corticosteroids, including emotional lability, weight gain, sodium retention, hypokalemia, acne, and increased intraocular pressure. Long-term use can result in oral candidiasis (thrush), osteoporosis, and muscle weakness. Adverse effects from intraarticular use include post-injection flare and joint swelling.\n\nPatients with congestive heart failure or severe hypertension may experience a higher incidence of edema and weight gain when taking systemically administered triamcinolone. Glucocorticoid drugs must be slowly tapered off with chronic use to prevent the occurrence of adrenal insufficiency (high risk if the drug is abruptly discontinued, especially in very ill patients).\n\nDrug-Drug Interactions\n\nContraindicated drugs include several vaccines, including adenovirus BCG live intravesical, live cholera vaccine, live dengue vaccine, live nasal influenza vaccine, live MMR, live rotavirus vaccine, live smallpox vaccine, live typhoid vaccine, live varicella vaccine, and live yellow fever vaccine. Desmopressin and mifepristone are also contraindicated for concurrent use. Other drugs (eg, thiazide and loop diuretics) can have additive effects resulting in hypokalemia.",
    "monitoring": "Patients taking triamcinolone should undergo monitoring to relieve symptoms and any adverse effects. Monitoring parameters include body weight, blood pressure, electrolytes, 2-hour postprandial glucose, chest radiograph with extended therapy duration, and bone mineral density with prolonged use or in patients older than 65.\n[19]\n[20]\nIt is essential to monitor the cardiac function in patients with a medical history of congestive heart failure or arrhythmias.",
    "toxicity": "Glucocorticoids such as triamcinolone can cause variable neuropsychiatric symptoms to develop. Examples of these symptoms include mania, depression, delirium, and psychosis.\n[21]\nThese symptoms and other cognitive issues resulting from taking triamcinolone can be reversible after discontinuing the medication. An increased risk of suicide in patients on chronic glucocorticoid therapy has been recorded, so triamcinolone use warrants caution.\n\nCardiovascular effects can also be seen in patients using triamcinolone. Premature atherosclerosis, hypertension, fluid retention, and arrhythmias can occur in these patients, especially when prescribing a higher drug dosage. Many of these cardiovascular issues are likely to disappear upon discontinuation of triamcinolone."
