For the treatment of acute gout flares, the adjusted dosage recommended is 1.2 mg for one dose. Administration should not be repeated for at least three days. For the prophylaxis of gout flares, the adjusted dosage should be 0.3 mg twice a day (or 0.6 mg once a day) if the original regimen was 0.6 mg twice a day, and 0.3 mg once a day if the original regimen was 0.6 once a day. For the treatment of familial Mediterranean fever, the maximum dosage of colchicine is 1.2 mg/day (may be given as 0.6 mg twice a day) when used in the presence of moderate CYP450 3A4 inhibitors. Other significant inhibitors of CYP450 3A4 include amiodarone, dronedarone, imatinib, posaconazole, and quinupristin-dalfopristin, although the extent to which they may interact with colchicine is unknown.
