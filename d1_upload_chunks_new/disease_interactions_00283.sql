Eighth cranial nerve damage may manifest as vestibular and/or auditory toxicities, including dizziness, nystagmus, vertigo, ataxia, tinnitus, and varying degrees of hearing impairment.  Nephrotoxicity is usually evidenced by tubular necrosis; increases in BUN, nonprotein nitrogen, and serum creatinine concentration; decreases in urine specific gravity and creatinine clearance; proteinuria; and cells or casts in the urine.  Rarely, renal electrolyte wasting may occur, resulting in hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypokalemia that may be associated with paresthesia, tetany, confusion, and positive Chvostek and Trousseau signs.  Although aminoglycoside- induced nephrotoxicity is generally reversible following discontinuation of the drug, death from uremia has occurred rarely.

Patients treated with diet plus a fixed dosage of either tolbutamide (a sulfonylurea) or phenformin (a biguanide) for 5 to 8 years had a cardiovascular mortality rate approximately 2.5 times that of patients treated with diet alone, resulting in discontinuation of both these treatments in the study.
