    "indications": "Hydrofluoric acid was discovered in 1771 by Swedish pharmaceutical chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele when he was investigating the mineral called fluorite (Calcium fluoride).  Hydrogen fluoride (HF) has several synonyms: Hydrofluoric acid, Fluoric acid, Hydrofluoride, Fluorine monohydride, Fluorane.  Hydrofluoric (HF) acid is an extremely powerful inorganic acid and a vigorous dehydrating agent that is used in many industrial branches including production of aluminum, stainless steel and hydrofluorocarbons, glass etching, stevedoring and transportation industries, inorganic and organic chemical manufacturing, mineral processing, petroleum oil refineries, fire extinguishers manufacturing, steel mills, cleaning HVAC systems, and as the precursor to all fluorine compands in the pharmaceutical industry.\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\nConsumer products containing hydrofluoric acid include rust removers, detergents, marble, brick and stone cleaning, toilet bowl clearners, insecticides, automobile wheel cleaners and air conditioner cleaners.\n[4]\n[5]\n\nHydrofluoric acid is comprised of a diatomic compound of hydrogen and fluoride atoms as a gas, while in the liquid state it has strong hydrogen bonds between the chains forming a polymeric compound.\n[6]\nAnhydrous hydrofluoric acid and hydrofluoric acid in aqueous solutions range in appearance from colorless to slightly tinted based upon the concentration and impurities.  It has a boiling point of 20 degrees celcius (68 degrees fahrenheit) at 760 mmHg, vapour density greater than air and readily dissolves in water that when diluted (exothermal reaction) is visibly indistinguishable from water.  Hydrofluoric acid has a disagreeable, pungent odor at concentrations of 0.04 ppm which is way below the OSHA PEL (Permissible Exposure Limit) of 3 ppm and is extremely corrosive and has the ability to dissovle a number of materials especially oxides.\n[4]\n\nThe Major source of production of hydrofluoric acid is by treating fluorite with concentrated sulfuric acid at temperatues of 265 degrees fahrenheit to produce hydrofluic acid and calcium sulfate.  Alternate production is a by-product in the production of phosphoric acid from the mineral apatite.  Hydrofluoric acid is also produced by the release from industrial and welding processes and environmental activities such as volcanoes.  HF production exceeds one million tons world wide by a number of manufactors and is transported and stored under high pressure as a highly concentrated liquid.\n[7]\nIn the United States of America, the Department of Transportation Hazard Label and National Fire Protection Assocation (NFPA) 704 lists the health value of 4 (can be lethal), flammability value of 0 (will not burn under typical fire conditions), instability value of 2 (readily undergoes violent chamical changes at elevated temperatures and pressures) and special value of W with line through (reacts violently or exposevely with water).  Domestic concentrations of hydrofluoric acid is typically around 0.5% with industrial concentrations approaching 100%.\n\nPrimary health consequences including dermal burns, eye injury, acute respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms and cardiac abnormalities can occur from direct skin / eye contact, ingestion of solutions or inhalation of fumes and vapors with unintentional and intentional exposures.   Unintentional exposure of hydrofluoric acid in and out of the workplace include inappropriate operations, mechanical failure of equipment, explosions of containers and tanks containing HF, during traffic incidents with leakage of HF, inadequate protective equipment and children accidentally exposed through ingestion of domestic cleaners.\n[4]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\nIntentional cases of ingestion, with suicidal and homicidal intent, of hydrofluoric acid have been documented.\n[4]\n[11]\n\nHydrofluoric acid is highly toxic and damaging to humans due to the “double danger” properties of the corrisive nature of the hydrogen ions and toxic effect due to the ability of fluoride ions to penetrate into deep tissue causing liquefactive necrosis and release of cellular products.  Hydrofluoric acid burns present with a unique concern for systemic fluoride toxicity including cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal and neuromuscular symptoms, electrolyte imbalance and enzyme inhibition which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and death.\n[12]\nChronic symptoms may occur or persist for months after HF ingestion or respiratory exposure.\n[3]\n[9]",
    "mechanism": "Hydrofluoric acid exposure requires immediate specific and specialized medical treatment to prevent penetration of the hydrofluoric acid into the deep tissues, decrease the dissemination of the fluoride ions through the bloodstream and subsequently reduce the toxic effects on organs or minimize the progression of damage to organ systems.\n[4]\nHydrofluoric acid is technically classified as a weak acid compared to other hydrogen halide acids, but the fluoride ion can be quickly absorbed through the skin causing potential life-threatening burns and cardiac arrhythmias.  With the dilute solutions, there will have delayed injury because ions will penetrate through the skin before dissociating and causing complications.  A dermal injury is reported as the most common observed injury with burns to the fingers being one of the most concerning injuries for workers.\n[13]",
    "monitoring": "Electrolyte imbalance is one of the hallmark concerns for systemic poisoning from hydrofluoric acid exposure through all routes of entry.  Immediate electrolyte assessment at minimum includes calcium, potassium, and magnesium levels to ascertain hypocalcemia, hypomagnesia and hyperkalemia.  Even though the concern is with systemic poisoning, patients with simple exposures can develop hypocalcemia, hypomagnesia, and hyperkalemia.\n\nCardiac monitoring and electrocardiography (EKG / ECG) are important to assess for clinically significant electrolyte imbalance to include QT prolongation from hypocalcemia (Figure 1), peaked T waves/arrhythmias from hyperkalemia, and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (specifically Torsades de Pointes) from hypomagnesia.\n\nChest x-rays should be performed on all patients with respiratory exposure to evaluate for pulmonary edema or pneumonitis.  Inclusion of EtCO2 monitoring can be considered for individuals with inhalation type exposures.  Urinalysis with evaluation for hematuria and proteinuria will indicate renal dysfunction, insufficiency and renal cortical necrosis.",
    "administration": "Primary concern with the high corrosiveness and toxicity of hydrofluoric acid should be through the prevention of exposure.   All individuals that use HF should be aware of the toxic properties of the agent which include information and procedures for safe handling of the acid, appropirate means of transporting and storage, management of waste containing HF, gross and fine decontaminiation procedures and medical treatment for exposure and intoxication.   Hydrofluoric acid should be exclusively used in industrial settings and laboratories that are appropriately equipped to handle the chemical, have appropriate exposure control plans in place which includes having appropriate treatment modalities on site to initiate therapy prior to transport of the exposed individual to the hospital.  Likewise, household and cleaning agents should be stored out of the reach of children.\n\nPersonal and general protectice equipment and measures should be implemented and adhered to at all times with equipment including:\n\nPerosnal protective equipment\nLaboratory coat\nLong pants\nAcid resistant apron\nClosed-toed shoes\nFull-face shiled in conjunction with tightly sealed goggles\nRubber gloves made from nitrile, butyl or neoprene\nRespiratory filter device\nGeneral protective equipment\nHandled inside of a fume hood\nVentilation / exhaust system\nSign \"Danger, Hydrofluoric Acid Used in this Area\"\nEasy access to a good supply of running water\nSafety shower and eyewash\nStandard Operating Procedure (SOP) document\nHFA Containers\nPolyethylene or Teflon\nClearly labelled\nSecurely supported and not likely to tip over\nTightly cosed and kept in a safe place\nAway from heat and direct sunlight\nFirst aid kit / medication\n2.5% calcium gluconate gel\n1% calcium gluconate eyewash solution of 0.13% benzalkonium choloride (Zephiran Chloride)\n\nInitial treatment for HF acid includes quick assessment, removal of contaminated clothing, as well as jewellery that could trap HF, should be immediately removed and double-bagged to prevent secondary exposure.  Decontamination with copious amounts of water, saline or solution of soap and water along with neutralization using calcium gluconate, benzalkonium chloride polyethelene glycol, magnesium oxide or Hexafluorine.\n[4]\nAssessment and management life-threating conditions such as airway compromise or cardiac arrythmias.\n\nThe decontaminzation and neutralzing process for hydrofluoric acid exposure is primarily through the mechanical rinsing and diluting effect of water, as a hypotonic solution.  Likewise it has no active ability to bind or chelate any chemical substance with the concerning hydrofluoric acid exposure and thefore neutralizing agents with their mechanism of actions can help reduce the necrosis from the fluoride ion.  Calcium gluconate is the primary neutralizing agent and is capable of chelating the free fluoride ions, forming insoluble salts.  Calcium gluconate should be applied multiple times to mitigate the damage from the fluoride ions.\n[4]\n\nHexafluorine solution developed by PREVOR laboratories was designed for active washing of hydrofluoric acid splashes.   The solution has a triple effect in that it has the same rinsing and diluting properties as water, can neutralize the hydrogen ions and chelate the fluoride ions thus reducing the corrosive and cytotoxic effects of hydrofluoric acid.  Though in an experimental study by Hulten et al, there was little difference in reducing the electrolyte disturbances caused from dermal exposure of hydrofluoric acid when compared to water rinsing.\n[4]\n[18]\n\nTreatment modalities\n\nDermal exposure (initially or at the hospital)\nMost commonly used decontaminating procedure is rinsing with cold or warm running water or saline for at least 30 minutes.  Decontamination procedures using a soft brush, moving in a downward motion (from head to toe) with household dish soaps (Dawn, Palmolive) and water, with a pH value of at least 8 and should not exceed a pH value of 10.5, will help neutralize hydrofluoric acid with a low pH.   Rinsing should be thoroughly performed until the contaminant is removed.\nPrimary neutralizing process for HF with with use of calcium gluconate soaking, intravenous calcium gluconate (10%), and topical use of calcium gluconate gel (2.5%).\nWhen used as a gel, 2.5 % calcium gluconate should be applied and rubbed into the affected area for 15 - 30 minutes and should be reapplied every 10 - 15 minutes.  The Calcium gluconate gel will turn white as the calcium binds to the fluoride ions creating Calcium fluoride (CaF).  If used as a definitive treatment, 2.5% calcium gluconate should be applied 4 to 6 times daily, for 3 to 4 days.\n[4]\nAfter 30 minutes, reassess the patient, and if pain persists, subcutaneous infiltration of calcium gluconate is recommended at a dose of 0.5 mL of a 5% solution per square centimeter of surface burn extending 0.5 cm beyond the margin of involved tissue.\n[19]\nWith the concern for compartment syndrom, injections into the hand should be limited to 0.5 ml per phalanx with repeat injections as needed.\n[20]\nAdditional topical therapy includes iced solution of benzalkonium chloride (Zephiran Chloride) concentration of (0.13%).  Side effects of use include stinging pain or allergic reaction (urticaria, pruritus, dyspnea, chest tightness, swelling of the face, lips or tongue) or Hexafluorine solution.\n[12]\n[13]\n[21]\n[22]\n\nEye exposure\nHF may penetrate to internal structures.\nInitial treatment for eye exposure includes irrigation with large amount of gently flowing cool plain water or sterile 0.9 % saline solution for 15-30 minutes. A topical ophthalmic anesthetic solution can be used to help mitigate the irritation from the hydrofluoric acid and water irrigation.\nIntermittent irrigation using a sterile 1% calcium gluconate solution via a Morgan lens for 20 minutes.\nOther treatment modalities include irrigation with Hexafluorine.\n[7]\n\nInhalation exposure\nIn high concentrations may cause glossitis (obstruction of the airway) and acute pulmonary edema.\nManagement would include artificial respiration for the patient with severe exposure. Individuals who are breathing require 100 % oxygen with a 2.5% to 3% calcium gluconate nebulized solution.\nNoninvasive positive pressure ventilation may be necessary for individuals who develop pulmonary edem.\nTreatment of severe cases includes endotracheal intubation for airway protection and a surgical airway if necessary.\n\nBurns with concentrated HF are usually very serious, with the potential for significant complications due to fluoride toxicity.  Concentrated HF liquid or vapor may cause severe burns, metabolic imbalances, pulmonary edema, and life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Even moderate exposures to concentrated HF may rapidly progress to fatality if left untreated. Burns larger than 25 square inches (160 square cm) may result in serious systemic toxicity. Relief of pain is the only indication of the effectiveness of treatment. Therefore, the use of any analgesic agents is not advisable.\n[12]\n[13]\n[21]\n\nA person who has HF burns greater than four square inches should be admitted immediately to an intensive care unit and carefully monitored for 24 to 48 hours. Anyone who has been exposed to gaseous HF and experiences respiratory irritation also should be admitted to and monitored in an intensive care unit. Blood sampling should be taken to monitor fluoride, potassium, and calcium levels. In some cases, hemodialysis is necessary for fluoride removal and correction of hyperkalemia and recurrent hypocalcemia."
