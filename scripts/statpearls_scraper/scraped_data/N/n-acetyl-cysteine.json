    "indications": "Chloroform (CHCl\n3\n) is a colorless liquid and a volatile organic compound that has historically been widely used as an anesthetic. This substance is now primarily used in laboratory settings and in the manufacturing of various industrial products.\n[1][2]\nDue to its toxicity and associated health risks, chloroform is considered a hazardous substance, and it falls under strict regulatory oversight by governmental agencies to safeguard its proper handling and disposal.\n[3]\n\nAlthough chloroform toxicity is infrequent, it can occur through accidental inhalation of its vapors during occupational exposures and, less commonly, through ingestion or intentional inhalation in suicide attempts.\n[4][5]\nNumerous case reports have indicated a potential correlation between both acute and chronic chloroform exposure and heightened risks of liver and kidney diseases, along with other health complications.\n[3]",
    "mechanism": "Chloroform is a colorless, sweet-smelling, nonflammable liquid with low water solubility. This compound was initially synthesized in the 1830s and has historically been used for various purposes, including anesthesia and water purification.\n[6][7]\nChloroform was used as a general anesthetic in the late 1800s until its associated complications, resulting in fatalities, prompted its replacement by nitric oxide. Chloroform was also used to disinfect drinking water until 1979 when the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) commenced regulating disinfection byproducts in drinking water.\n[3]\nThis raised concerns, particularly as rat studies had previously linked exposure to chloroform and other disinfection byproducts in drinking water with heightened cancer risk and other health issues. While some countries still use chloroform for water disinfection, this practice is not universal.\n[1]\nRecent research indicates a limited association with human cancers attributed to decreased chloroform usage in water purification processes.\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n\nCurrently, chloroform finds limited application in industrial manufacturing and scientific investigation. Chloroform is used as a solvent in the industry for the production of pharmaceuticals, automobiles, plastics, and other chemicals such as cleaners and refrigerants.\n[1][5]\nMoreover, chloroform is utilized in scientific research, particularly in chemistry, where it functions as a solvent and reagent in various reactions.\n[5]\nDue to its toxicity and potential health hazards, the use of chloroform is strictly regulated.\n[9][1]\nAs a result, chloroform toxicity remains relatively uncommon in modern times, predominantly arising from unintentional inhalation during occupational exposures. Nonetheless, documented instances of chloroform-related toxicity include cases of suicide, homicide, and other criminal activities involving its ingestion or inhalation.\n[4][5][10]",
    "monitoring": "Initial chemistry findings may reveal no abnormalities in acute chloroform toxicity. Evidence of harm typically becomes apparent only between 12 and 48 hours after exposure to chloroform, with abnormal laboratory levels continuing to escalate over the subsequent days. LFTs may indicate elevated levels of aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and glutamate dehydrogenase. Additionally, increasing levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine may suggest acute kidney injury. Coagulation abnormalities may occur due to acute liver failure.\n[19]\n[16]\nElevations in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels may also be observed. Furthermore, an abdominal x-ray may detect a radiopaque material, indicating the ingestion of a halogenated hydrocarbon, such as chloroform.\n[7]\n\nElevations in liver enzymes are notably higher compared to those observed in acute exposures in cases of chronic toxicity. Elevations in ammonia and LDH levels, as well as coagulation profiles, are also observable. Testing for hepatitis and rheumatological panels can aid in ruling out hepatitis as an underlying condition. Ultrasound examinations conducted in cases of chronic toxicity may reveal hepatomegaly, fatty liver, and signs of hepatitis.\n[16]",
    "administration": "The initial assessment requires a comprehensive evaluation of the airway, breathing, and circulation, complemented by continuous cardiac monitoring and pulse oximetry. Intubation may be considered based on the patient's cognitive state and oxygen needs. Following intubation, activated charcoal and sorbitol should be administered via a nasogastric tube.\n[17]\n[6]\nIncorporating\nN\n-acetylcysteine can be beneficial to restore glutathione levels and mitigate the circulation of free radicals.\n[18]\n[13]\nIn contrast, routine gastric lavage is not advised.\n[2]\n[17]\n[2]\n\nThe management of hypotension involves the administration of intravenous fluids and vasopressors.\n[5]\nConsultation with nephrology specialists is recommended to assess the need for urine alkalization.\n[9]\nThe rationale behind urine alkalization in chloroform toxicity is grounded in the compound's nature as a weak acid. By increasing the alkalinity of urine, the elimination of chloroform is enhanced. Moreover, the alkalization of urine facilitates the transformation of acidic chloroform into a less toxic, alkaline form.\n[19]\nPatients with renal failure and metabolic acidosis should undergo dialysis to address their condition effectively.\n[5]\nPatients should be admitted for close monitoring in an intensive care unit setting. In cases involving voluntary ingestion or inhalation, referral to psychiatry is recommended once the patient has been medically stabilized and cleared for discharge.\n\nIn cases of chronic toxicity, a pragmatic approach involving hydration and conservative care is advised.\n[6]\nSeeking additional consultation with gastroenterology experts can help assess elevated liver enzyme levels. In addition, timely removal of the patient from chloroform exposure is essential for an effective management strategy.",
    "adverse_effects": "Potential complications that may develop in patients with chloroform toxicity include:\n\nAcute liver failure\nAcute renal failure\nDisseminated intravascular coagulation\nRespiratory failure\nCardiac arrhythmia"
