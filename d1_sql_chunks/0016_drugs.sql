Esomeprazole has been shown to inhibit acid secretion to a similar extent as [DB00338], without any significant differences between the two compounds _in vitro_. 

Esomeprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of esomeprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, esomeprazole''s duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]

PPIs such as esomeprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]

By inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver, statins lower abnormal cholesterol and lipid levels, and ultimately reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid. This conversion is a critical metabolic reaction involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport, including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL).

Also known as the marketed product Strattera, atomoxetine is used with other treatment modalities (psychological, educational, cognitive behaviour therapy, etc) to improve developmentally inappropriate symptoms associated with ADHD including distractibility, short attention span, hyperactivity, emotional lability, and impulsivity. Although the underlying pathophysiology that causes ADHD remains unclear, evidence suggests that dysregulation in noradrenergic and dopaminergic pathways plays a critical role in suboptimal executive functioning within prefrontal regions of the brain, which are involved in attention and memory.[A178090] Atomoxetine has been shown to specifically increase NA and DA within the prefrontal cortex, but not in the nucleus accumbens (NA) or striatum.[A18262] This is beneficial in the treatment of ADHD as DA activation in the subcortical NA and striatum is associated with many stimulant-associated side effects and an increase in abuse potential, which is a limiting factor associated with the use of stimulant medications such as [DB00422], [DB01576], and [DB01255].[A18262] Use of non-stimulant medications such as atomoxetine is therefore thought to offer a clinical advantage over the use of traditional medications for the management of ADHD. More recently, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies in rhesus monkeys have shown that atomoxetine also binds to the serotonin transporter (SERT),[A178111] and blocks the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor,[A18263] indicating a role for the glutamatergic system in the pathophysiology of ADHD. 

Long-acting formulations of psychostimulants (such as [DB00422], [DB01576], and [DB01255]) are typically considered the most effective and first-line treatment for ADHD in adults and children as recommended by CADDRA (Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance).[L6037] However, these stimulant medications are limited by dose-related side effects and concerns of abuse. Many contain a blackbox warning stating that CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate-containing products and amphetamines, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. In particular, increased dopamine in key areas caused by these stimulant medications is associated with their reinforcing and addictive properties, and even amplifies the potency and reinforcing effects of other drugs of abuse such as amphetamines, making ADHD sufferers more susceptible to their addictive effects.[A177556] Concerns about abuse potential have spurred research into medications with fewer effects on DA and the use of non-stimulant ADHD medications including atomoxetine, [DB00745] and [DB01018]. The non-stimulant norepinephrine/dopamine reuptake inhibitor [DB01156] (commonly used for the treatment of depression and for smoking cessation) has also been shown to be effective in the treatment of ADHD.[A178099]','["N06BA09"]','[]'),(14605,'Everson massage spray 100 ml','ايفرزون مساج سبراي 100 مل','95','','Massage spray','Camphor oil+eucalyptus oil+di ethanol anime salselate+pepperment oil+canolaoil+menthol+panthenol+glycerin+ve+vb5','Doctors pharma','Spray','بخاخ','100 ml','1','','','','',846,'2022-09-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(14606,'Aaa','ششش','240','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',679,'2022-09-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(14607,'Attivo hair oil serum 120 ml','اتيفو زيت شعر 120 مل','80','','Hair care','','El-helou perfumes & cosmetics > safety pharma','Hair oil','زيت شعر','120 ml','1','سيروم الشعر للتحكم في التجعد وتحسين لمعان الشعر.و تقوية كل خصلة شعر','','','',934,'2022-07-18',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(14608,'Attivo shampoo 250 ml','اتيفو شامبو 250 مل','195','125','Hair care','','El-helou perfumes & cosmetics > safety pharma','Amp','أمبول','250 ml','1','شامبو للشعر -- نظافة الشعر -- الحفاظ علي حيوية ولمعان الشعر','anti-dandruff','','',1278,'2025-08-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(14609,'Attivo whitening cream 50 gm','اتيفو كريم للتفتيح 50 جم','150','130','Whitening topical','','El-helou perfumes & cosmetics > safety pharma','Cream','كريم','50 gm','1','كريم تفتيح للجلد -- كريم لتركيب الجلد -- علاج اثار حروق الشمس','whitening cream','','',2466,'2025-08-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(14610,'Attractive hair cream 50 gm','اتراكتيف كريم شعر 50 جم','45','','Hair care','','Egyptian company for cosmetics','Cream','كريم','50 gm','1','','','','',628,'2022-08-05',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(14611,'Aubagio 14 mg 28 tab','اوباجيو 14مجم 28 قرص','16,000','','Immunosuppressants','Teriflunomide','Sanofi winthrop > sanofi','Tab','أقراص','14 mg','4','','indications: multiple sclerosis: treatment of patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. this once-daily medication can reduce relapse rate. teriflunomide can cause liver damage (hepatotoxicity) hair loss and other side effects. it is harmful to','','',2742,'2022-07-05',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Teriflunomide is the active metabolite of leflunomide, and it acts as an immunomodulatory agent by inhibiting pyrimidine synthesis.

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as sofosbuvir. As a prodrug nucleotide analog, Sofosbuvir is metabolized into its active form as the antiviral agent 2''-deoxy-2''-α-fluoro-β-C-methyluridine-5''-triphosphate (also known as GS-461203), which acts as a defective substrate for NS5B (non-structural protein 5B) [synthesis]. NS5B, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is essential for the transcription of Hepatitis C viral RNA and for its high replicative rate and genetic diversity [A19594]. Sofosbuvir and other direct acting antivirals are therefore very potent options for the treatment of Hepatitis C, as they exhibit a high barrier to the development of resistance [A19593]. This is an important advantage relative to HCV drugs that target other viral enzymes such as the protease, for which rapid development of resistance has proven to be an important cause of therapeutic failure.  

In a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend Sofosbuvir as first line therapy in combination with other antivirals for all six genotypes of Hepatitis C [L852]. Depending on the genotype, sofosbuvir is often used in combination with other antivirals such as [DB09027], [DB11613], [DB09102], [DB06290], [DB11574], [DB11575], [DB00811], [DB00008], or [DB00022] with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626]. Treatment with direct acting antivirals such as sofosbuvir is associated with very minimal side effects, with the most common being headache and fatigue [FDA Label]. Lack of significant side effects and short duration of therapy is a considerable advantage over older interferon- and ribavirin-based regimens, which were limited by infusion site reactions, reduced blood count, and neuropsychiatric effects [A19635]. 

Since 2014, sofosbuvir has been available as a fixed dose combination product with [DB09027] (tradename Harvoni) used for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C. Approved in October 2014 by the FDA, Harvoni is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1, 4, 5, and 6 with or without [DB00811] depending on the level of liver damage or cirrhosis [FDA Label].  When combined together, ledipasvir and sofosbuvir as the combination product Harvoni has been shown to achieve a SVR between 93 and 99% after 12 weeks of treatment [A7535]. Its use has also proven successful in the treatment of HCV in patients co-infected with HIV [A19627].

Sofosbuvir is also available as a fixed dose combination product with [DB11613] as the commercially available product Epclusa. First approved in June 2016, Epclusa is the first combination HCV product indicated for the treatment of all genotypes of Hepatitis C with or without cirrhosis. Epclusa is also currently the most potent HCV antiviral medication on the market with a sustained virologic response (SVR) after 12 weeks of therapy of 93-99% depending on genotype and level of cirrhosis [L852]. Both Canadian and American guidelines list Epclusa as a first line recommendation for all genotypes of HCV [L852, A19626].

Notably, sofosbuvir has come under intense scrutiny since its release to market in 2013. With the price per pill set at $1000, a 12-week treatment can cost upwards of $84,000 per patient [A19636].','["J05AP08", "J05AP51", "J05AP55", "J05AP56"]','[]'),(14621,'Aaa','ششش','22','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',743,'2023-04-18',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(14622,'Augmacillin 457mg/5ml susp. 60 ml','اوجماسيللين 457مجم/5 مل معلق 60 مل','48','32.5','Penicillins.penicillin with b-lactamase inhibitor','Amoxicillin+clavulanic acid','Mepaco','Susp','معلق','457mg','1','','amoxicillin is an analog of ampicillin derived from the basic penicillin nucleus 6-aminopenicillanic acid clavulanic acid is produced by the fermentation of streptomyces clavuligerus. it is a beta-lactam structurally related to the penicillins and possess','6223002210428','',1052,'2024-05-06',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(14624,'Augmentin 1.2g vial for i.v. inj./inf.','اوجمنتين 1.2 جم 1فيال','36','','Penicillins.penicillin with b-lactamase inhibitor.antibiotic','Amoxicillin+clavulanic acid','Mup > glaxo smithkline','Inj','حقن','','1','مضاد حيوي','amoxicillin is an analog of ampicillin derived from the basic penicillin nucleus 6-aminopenicillanic acid clavulanic acid is produced by the fermentation of streptomyces clavuligerus. it is a beta-lactam structurally related to the penicillins and possess','6221045009139','',2493,'2022-12-03',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL);

Furthermore, in 2009 the US FDA approved milnacipran for the additional indication of treating fibromyalgia [F3925], although other regional regulatory authorities like the EMA, among others, have not yet approved the agent for such treatment, citing lack of robust evidence of efficacy, insufficient demonstration of maintenance of effect, and other concerns [F3928, F3934]. Nevertheless, milnacipran demonstrates a somewhat unique characteristic among SNRIs to elicit a relatively balanced reuptake inhibition of both serotonin and noradrenaline, with a somewhat increased preference for noradrenaline reuptake inhibition - which is potentially a point of interest given the plausible proposal that noradrenaline plays an important role in the mitigation of pain signals in the descending inhibitory pain pathways in the brain and spinal cord [A175759, A175843, A175846].

Moreover, recent research has shown that the levorotatory enantiomer of milnacipran, levomilnacipran, may have the capacity to inhibit the activity of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1), which has investigationally been associated with β-amyloid plaque formation - making the agent a possible course of treatment for Alzheimer''s disease [A175957].','["N06AX17"]','[]'),(14738,'elay spray 70 ml','ايلاي سبراي 70 مل','100','80','Moisturizing','sea water - panthenol - hyalorunic','optimasa','spray','بخاخ','70 ml','1','','','','',2439,'2025-12-24',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(14739,'Averopreg 100mg/5ml syrup 60 ml','افيروبريج 100 مجم / 5 مل شراب 60 مل','56','','Anti-epileptic.gaba analogs','Pregabalin','Averroes pharma-egypt','Syrup','شراب','100mg','1','','about pregabalin a gaba agonist anticonvulsant. mechanism of action of pregabalin pregabalin is a gaba neurotransmitter analog. it produces its action by modulating calcium channels and also reduces the release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate norep','','',780,'2022-07-29',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Pregabalin is structurally similar to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) - an inhibitory neurotransmitter.[A173995] It may be used to manage neuropathic pain, postherpetic neuralgia, and fibromyalgia among other conditions.[A187190] Although as per the FDA Label the mechanism of action has not been definitively defined, there is evidence that pregabalin exerts its effects by binding to the α2δ subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels.[A187190][L7066] Pregabalin is marketed by Pfizer under the trade name Lyrica and Lyrica Cr (extended release).[L1006][L7066] It may have dependence liability if misused but the risk appears to be highest in patients with current or past substance use disorders.[A31161]','["N03AX16"]','[]'),(14740,'Mannitol 20% (mottahedoon) i.v. inf. 500 ml (rubber cap)','مانيتول 20% المتحدون محلول وريدي 500 مل بغطاء مطاطي','58','32','Osmotic diuretic','Mannitol','Al mottahedoon pharma','Cap','كبسولة','20%','1','','','','',769,'2024-09-30',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that is metabolically inert in humans and occurs naturally, as a sugar or sugar alcohol, in fruits and vegetables.

It is primarily used for the treatment of respiratory, enteric and genitourinary infections and may be used instead of other macrolides for some sexually transmitted and enteric infections. It is structurally related to erythromycin [A174169].

Azithromycin [9-deoxo-9a-aza-9a-methyl-9a-homoerythromycin] is a part of the _azalide_ subclass of macrolides, and contains a 15-membered ring, with a methyl-substituted nitrogen instead of a carbonyl group at the 9a position on the aglycone ring, which allows for the prevention of its metabolism. This differentiates azithromycin from other types of macrolides [A174175].

In March 2020, a small study was funded by the French government to investigate the treatment of COVID-19 with a combination of azithromycin and the anti-malaria drug [hydroxychloroquine].

More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Rosuvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [simvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] This is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than [atorvastatin]''s effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial[A181427] concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.

Rosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]','["C10BX10", "C10BX05", "C10BX07", "C10AA07", "A10BH52", "G01AE10", "C10BX13", "C10BX09", "C10BA09", "C10BX16", "C10BX17", "C10BX14", "C10BA06"]','[]'),(15053,'Bemofil 500 i.u.vial (n/a)','بيموفيل 500 وحدة فيال','750','','Blood-coagulation factor','Blood-coagulation factor ix','Finnish red cross blood transfusion service > amc','Vial','فيال','','1','','when blood vessels are cut or damaged the loss of blood from the system must be stopped before shock and possible death occur. this is accomplished by solidification of the blood a process called coagulation or clotting. a blood clot consists of a plug of','','',677,'2022-08-02',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'B02BD04',NULL),(15054,'Ben jex vag.douche 200 ml','بن جكس غسول مهبلي 200 مل','16','','Vaginal wash','','Hi-care > revano pharm','Unknown','غير محدد','200 ml','1','غسول مهبلي','','','',1806,'2022-05-13',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(15055,'Ben ten topical lotion 60 ml','بين تن لوشن موضعي 60 مل','30','','Diaper rash','Zinc oxide+wheat germ oil+liquid paraffin+olive oil+panthenol+calendula+chamomile+aloe vera','Egyptian company for cosmetics > infinity pharm','Lotion','لوشن','60 ml','1','يستخدم في حالات التسلخات الناتجة من الحفاضات الاطفال -- يساعد علي ترطيب الجلد -- تقليل الاحمرار والحكة -- تقليل الالتهابات','effective unique formula which targets the scratch step that trigger eczema. has potent effect for treating eczema diaper rash and intetrigo. reduces skin inflammation pain and redness. sooths & moistures the skin and improves skin conditions. improves sk','','',1438,'2022-04-09',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(15056,'Aaa','ششش','9','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',795,'2022-09-04',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(15057,'Aaa','ششش','8','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',788,'2022-09-04',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL);

The first known inhibitor of SGLTs, phlorizin, was isolated from the bark of apple trees in 1835 and researched extensively into the 20th century, but was ultimately deemed inappropriate for clinical use given its lack of specificity and significant gastrointestinal side effects.[A203501] Attempts at overcoming these limitations first saw the development of O-glucoside analogs of phlorizin (e.g. [remogliflozin etabonate]), but these molecules proved relatively pharmacokinetically unstable. The development of C-glucoside phlorizin analogs remedied the issues observed in the previous generation, and led to the FDA approval of [canagliflozin] in 2013 and both [dapagliflozin] and empagliflozin in 2014.[A203501] As the most recently approved of the "flozin" drugs, empagliflozin carries the highest selectivity for SGLT2 over SGLT1 (approximately 2700-fold). Empagliflozin was further approved by the EMA in March 2022 and Health Canada in April 2022, making it the first and only approved treatment in Europe and Canada for adults with symptomatic chronic heart failure regardless of ejection fraction.[L40783,L13916]','["A10BD19", "A10BD20", "A10BK03", "A10BD27"]','[]'),(15127,'Aaa','ششش','16','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',798,'2022-08-16',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(15129,'Pentamero 120ml syrup','بنتاميرو شراب 120 مل','45','','Support respiratory system health','Ivy leaf extract','Tesla','Syrup','شراب','120ml','1','مكمل غذائى لدعم صحة الجهاز التنفسى','','','',849,'2022-09-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(15130,'Betallerge 0.25/2 mg 30 tabs.','بيتاليرج 0.25/2مجم 30 قرص','42','27.5','Antihistamine.antiallergy.combined with glucocorticoid steroid','Betamethasone+dexchlorpheniramine maleate','Penta pharma-egypt','Tab','أقراص','2 mg','1','مضاد للحساسية -- مضاد للالتهابات','indications / uses betamethasone/dexchlorphenamine maleate tablet and syrup are recommended in the treatment of difficult cases of respiratory dermatologic and ocular allergies as well as ocular inflammatory disorders where adjunctive systemic corticoster','6224007738108','',9317,'2024-09-12',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(15131,'Aaa','ششش','12','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',709,'2022-08-31',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(15132,'Osaya vitamin c & zinc 20eff.tablets','اوسايا فيتامين سي مع الزنك 20 قرص فوار','145','','Multivitamin','Vitamin c + zinc','Osaya pharma','Tablet','أقراص','','1','','','','',708,'2022-09-04',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(15133,'Betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% oint. 20 gm','بيتاميثازون ديبروبيونات 0.05% مرهم 20جم','12','6','Glucocorticoid','Betamethasone','Amriya','Oint','مرهم','0.05%','1','','about betamethasone potent glucocorticoid anti-inflammatory immunosuppressent. mechanism of action of betamethasone the drug exerts it`s pharmacological action by penetrating and binding to cytoplasmic receptor protein and causes a structural change in st','6221075080016','',880,'2023-09-20',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Betamethasone is a long-acting corticosteroid with immunosuppressive and antiinflammatory properties.[A192444] It can be used topically to manage inflammatory skin conditions such as eczema, and parenterally to manage several disease states including autoimmune disorders.[A192444] Betamethasone has potent glucocorticoid activity and negligible mineralocorticoid activity.[A192444]','["R01AD06", "D07BC01", "S01BA06", "S01BB04", "S01CB04", "H02AB01", "C05AA05", "S03CA06", "D07XC01", "D07AC01", "A07EA04", "S02BA07", "R03BA04", "S03BA03", "S01CA05", "D07CC01"]','[]'),(15134,'Biocefixim 100mg/5ml pd. for oral susp. 60 ml','بيوسفكسيم 100مجم/5مل معلق 60 مل','64','44.5','Antibiotic.cephalosporin.third-generation','Cefixime','Badr pharma','Susp','معلق','100mg','1','','','','',717,'2024-07-15',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Cefixime, an antibiotic, is a third-generation cephalosporin like ceftriaxone and cefotaxime.

Aaron B. Lerner of Yale University is credited for naming the hormone and for defining its chemical structure in 1958.  In mammals, melatonin is produced by the pineal gland. The pineal gland is small endocrine gland, about the size of a rice grain and shaped like a pine cone (hence the name), that is located in the center of the brain (rostro-dorsal to the superior colliculus) but outside the blood-brain barrier. The secretion of melatonin increases in darkness and decreases during exposure to light, thereby regulating the circadian rhythms of several biological functions, including the sleep-wake cycle. In particular, melatonin regulates the sleep-wake cycle by chemically causing drowsiness and lowering the body temperature.  Melatonin is also implicated in the regulation of mood, learning and memory, immune activity, dreaming, fertility and reproduction. Melatonin is also an effective antioxidant.  Most of the actions of melatonin are mediated through the binding and activation of melatonin receptors. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may have lower than normal levels of melatonin. A 2008 study found that unaffected parents of individuals with ASD also have lower melatonin levels, and that the deficits were associated with low activity of the ASMT gene, which encodes the last enzyme of melatonin synthesis. Reduced melatonin production has also been proposed as a likely factor in the significantly higher cancer rates in night workers.','["N05CH01"]','[]'),(15147,'Betathalmic 0.5% eye drops 10 ml','بيتاثالميك 0.5% نقط للعين 10 مل','51','39','Antihypertensive.beta blocker.selective b1','Betaxolol','Sigma tec > cardinal pharmaceutical','Drops','نقط','0.5%','1','','about betaxolol cardioselective beta 1-adrenergic blocker anti glaucoma antihypertensive. mechanism of action of betaxolol betaxolol is a selective beta 1 (? 1) blocker. it inhibits the beta receptors present in the eye such as in the ciliary body epithel','6223005930019','',2116,'2025-01-29',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'A cardioselective beta-1-adrenergic antagonist with no partial agonist activity.','["S01ED02", "C07AB05", "S01ED52"]','[]'),(15148,'Betathalmic 0.5% eye drops 5 ml','بيتاثالميك 0.5% قطرة 5 مل','24','12.5','Antihypertensive.beta blocker.selective b1','Betaxolol','Sigma tec > cardinal pharmaceutical','Drops','نقط','0.5%','1','','about betaxolol cardioselective beta 1-adrenergic blocker anti glaucoma antihypertensive. mechanism of action of betaxolol betaxolol is a selective beta 1 (? 1) blocker. it inhibits the beta receptors present in the eye such as in the ciliary body epithel','','',808,'2025-01-29',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'A cardioselective beta-1-adrenergic antagonist with no partial agonist activity.','["S01ED02", "C07AB05", "S01ED52"]','[]');

Sir James Black, a Scottish pharmacologist, pioneered the use of beta-blockers for the management of angina pectoris in 1958 for which he received the Nobel Prize.[A178429] Beta-blockers quickly became popular in clinical use and where subsequently investigated for use in myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, and hypertension during the 1960s. Later they continued to be investigated for use in heart failure throughout the 1970-1980s. Atenolol itself was developed early on in this history by Alvogen Malta under the trade name Tenormin and received FDA approval in September, 1981.[label]

Despite being one of the most widely prescribed beta blockers, evidence suggests atenolol may not significantly reduce mortality, and only modestly reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with hypertension.[A235850,A235855] A Cochrane review of patients being treated for primary hypertension shows that atenolol shows a risk ratio of 0.88 for cardiovascular disease risk and a risk ratio of 0.99 for mortality.[A235850,A235855] Similar results have been found in other meta-analyses.[A235860,A235865] A meta-analysis of over 145,000 patients showed the risk of stroke in patients taking atenolol may depend on the age of the patient.[A235865] The use of atenolol may need to be based on more patient factors than hypertension alone.[A235850,A235855,A235860,A235865]','["C07CB53", "C07AB03", "C07FB03", "C07DB01", "C07BB03", "C07CB03"]','[]'),(15165,'Betmiga 25 mg 30 prolonged r. tablets','بيتميجا 25مجم 30 قرص ممتد المفعول','450','','Overactive bladder','Mirabegron','Astellas pharma > multipharma','Tablet','أقراص','25 mg','3','','','','',3494,'2022-06-14',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Mirabegron is a sympathomimetic beta-3 adrenergic receptor agonist used to relax the smooth muscle of the bladder in the treatment of urinary frequency and incontinence.

More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Rosuvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [simvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] This is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than [atorvastatin]''s effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial[A181427] concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.

Rosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]','["C10BX10", "C10BX05", "C10BX07", "C10AA07", "A10BH52", "G01AE10", "C10BX13", "C10BX09", "C10BA09", "C10BX16", "C10BX17", "C10BX14", "C10BA06"]','[]'),(15266,'Aaa','ششش','15','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',736,'2022-10-18',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(15267,'Biodx 10 billion 8 sachets','بيودكس 10 بيليون 8 اكياس','40','','Antidiarrhoeal','Probiotic+prebiotic+zinc','Healthy tech pharma > nutr-med pharma','Sachet','أكياس','','1','مضاد للاسهال','lactobacillus rhamnosus gg & bifidobacterium lactis oligsaccharides zinc indications : diarrheal infections git immunity ibs dose: 1-2 sachets','','',1423,'2022-07-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(15268,'Biofaximin 200 mg 30 f.c. tab.','بيوفاكسيمين 200مجم 10 اقراص','125','','Travelers diarrhea','Rifaximin','Biopharm egypt','Tab','أقراص','200 mg','1','يستخدم لعلاج الاسهال الناتج من سفر الشخص لبلد أخرى.','indication for the treatment of patients (?12 years of age) with travelers diarrhea caused by noninvasive strains of escherichia coli. rifaximin is also designated an orphan drug by the food and drug administration for the adjunctive treatment of hepatic','','',1671,'2022-05-13',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Rifaximin is a semisynthetic, rifamycin-based non-systemic antibiotic, meaning that the drug will not pass the gastrointestinal wall into the circulation as is common for other types of orally administered antibiotics.
