    "indications": "Thiamine was the first vitamin identified (vitamin B1) many years ago. It functions as a catalyst in the generation of energy through decarboxylation of branched-chain amino acids and alpha-ketoacids and acts as a coenzyme for transketolase reactions in the form of thiamine pyrophosphate. Thiamine also plays an unidentified role in propagating nerve impulses and taking part in myelin sheath maintenance.\n[1]\n\nThis water-soluble vitamin is present in meat, beef, pork, legumes, whole grains, and nuts; however, milled rice and grains have small amounts of thiamine as the processing involved in creating these food products removes thiamine. Additionally, certain food products such as tea, coffee, raw fish, and shellfish contain thiaminases - enzymes that destroy thiamine.\n\nThiamine deficiency can affect the cardiovascular, nervous, and immune systems, as commonly seen in wet beriberi, dry beriberi, or Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Worldwide it is most widely reported in populations where polished rice and milled cereals are the primary food source and in patients with chronic alcohol use disorder. Dry beriberi presents as symmetrical peripheral neuropathy, while wet beriberi presents with high-output heart failure. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS) can manifest with CNS symptoms such as gait changes, altered mental status, and ocular abnormalities.\n[2]",
    "mechanism": "Deficiency of thiamine can be related to\n[3]\n:\n\nPoor intake\n\nDiets primarily high in polished rice/processed grains\nChronic alcoholism\nParenteral nutrition without adequate thiamine supplementation\nGastric bypass surgery\n\nPoor absorption\n\nMalnutrition\nGastric bypass surgery\nMalabsorption syndrome\n\nIncreased loss\n\nDiarrhea\nHyperemesis gravidarum\nDiuretic use\nRenal replacement therapy\n\nIncreased thiamine utilization\n\nPregnancy\nLactation\nHyperthyroidism\nRefeeding syndrome\n\nDrugs that can lead to thiamine deficiency\n\nDiuretics",
    "monitoring": "Detection of thiamine deficiency relies on relevant history and physical exam findings and follow-up with laboratory testing for confirmation.\n[6]\nLaboratory Studies\n\nFunctional enzymatic assay of transketolase activity - transketolase activity is measured before and after the addition of thiamine pyrophosphate; greater than 25% stimulation response is abnormal.\nMeasurement of thiamine or the phosphorylated esters of thiamine in serum or blood using high-performance liquid chromatography\nUrine studies exist but are not a reliable test for the evaluation of total body thiamine.\nMetabolic acidosis can occur with thiamine deficiency due to the accumulation of lactate.\n\nConsider other diagnostic studies based on presentation and comorbid conditions (transthoracic echo or TSH measurements in new heart failure, for example).\n\nRadiographic Studies\n\nMR: most common abnormalities seen with WE are symmetric changes in the thalamus, mamillary bodies, periaqueductal area, and tectal plate.\n[7]",
    "administration": "Treatment of Acute Thiamine D\neficiency with Cardiovascular or Neurologic Signs/Symptoms\n[4]\n\n200mg intravenous (IV) or orally (PO) thiamine three times daily until symptoms resolve or improvement plateaus, at which time the patient should transition to 10 mg/day oral thiamine until expected recovery is complete.\n\nAnother option in acute crisis is 50mg administered intramuscularly for 2-4 days, followed by oral maintenance therapy\n\nTreatment of Thiamine Deficiency with S\nuspected WKS\n[8]\n\n500mg IV thiamine infused over 30mins three times on days 1 and 2 of therapy\n250mg thiamine IV or intramuscularly on days 3 through 5 of therapy\n\n**Always give thiamine during the re-feeding period in a patient with alcoholism to prevent acute thiamine deficiency with lactic acidosis.**\n\nSymptoms consistent with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome may persist for several months or may be permanent.\n\nOther symptoms of thiamine deficiency such as anorexia and irritability are expected to improve gradually.",
    "adverse_effects": "There are no known toxicities associated with thiamine repletion. Some reports of anaphylaxis and bronchospasm with high-dose intravenous thiamine exist."
