In addition, symptomatic hypotension can occur in susceptible individuals, which may compromise renal and myocardial perfusion.  In patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF), treatment with AR antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and, rarely, renal failure, myocardial ischemia, and death.  Therapy with AR antagonists should be initiated cautiously in patients with severe CHF, especially when accompanied by volume and/or sodium depletion.  In patients who experience a decline in renal function, discontinuation of AR antagonist therapy is usually not required provided there is symptomatic improvement of the heart failure and renal deterioration is well-tolerated.  Transient hypotension is also not a contraindication to further treatment with AR antagonists, since therapy can usually be reinstated without difficulty after blood pressure stabilizes.', '2', 'Weber MA, Byyny RL, Pratt JH, Faison EP, Snavely DB, Goldberg AI, Nelson EB "Blood pressure effects of the angiotensin II receptor blocker, losartan."

In addition, symptomatic and sometimes excessive hypotension can occur in susceptible individuals, particularly during the initiation of treatment, which may compromise renal and myocardial perfusion.  In patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF), treatment with ACE inhibitors may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and, rarely, renal failure, myocardial ischemia and death.  Therapy with ACE inhibitors should be initiated under very close medical supervision in patients with severe CHF, especially when accompanied by volume and/or sodium depletion.  Patients should be monitored closely for several hours after an initial dose until blood pressure has stabilized, and followed closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dosage of ACE inhibitor or diuretic is increased.  If feasible, the risk of severe hypotension may be minimized by reducing or temporarily withholding the dosing of diuretics and/or liberalizing dietary sodium intake for 2 to 3 days prior to starting ACE inhibitor therapy.  In patients who experience a worsening of renal function, discontinuation of ACE inhibitor therapy is usually not required provided there is symptomatic improvement of the heart failure and renal deterioration is well-tolerated.  Transient hypotension is also not a contraindication to further treatment with ACE inhibitors.

In addition, symptomatic and sometimes excessive hypotension can occur in susceptible individuals, particularly during the initiation of treatment, which may compromise renal and myocardial perfusion.  In patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF), treatment with ACE inhibitors may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and, rarely, renal failure, myocardial ischemia and death.  Therapy with ACE inhibitors should be initiated under very close medical supervision in patients with severe CHF, especially when accompanied by volume and/or sodium depletion.  Patients should be monitored closely for several hours after an initial dose until blood pressure has stabilized, and followed closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dosage of ACE inhibitor or diuretic is increased.  If feasible, the risk of severe hypotension may be minimized by reducing or temporarily withholding the dosing of diuretics and/or liberalizing dietary sodium intake for 2 to 3 days prior to starting ACE inhibitor therapy.  In patients who experience a worsening of renal function, discontinuation of ACE inhibitor therapy is usually not required provided there is symptomatic improvement of the heart failure and renal deterioration is well-tolerated.

In addition, symptomatic and sometimes excessive hypotension can occur in susceptible individuals, particularly during the initiation of treatment, which may compromise renal and myocardial perfusion.  In patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF), treatment with ACE inhibitors may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and, rarely, renal failure, myocardial ischemia and death.  Therapy with ACE inhibitors should be initiated under very close medical supervision in patients with severe CHF, especially when accompanied by volume and/or sodium depletion.  Patients should be monitored closely for several hours after an initial dose until blood pressure has stabilized, and followed closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dosage of ACE inhibitor or diuretic is increased.  If feasible, the risk of severe hypotension may be minimized by reducing or temporarily withholding the dosing of diuretics and/or liberalizing dietary sodium intake for 2 to 3 days prior to starting ACE inhibitor therapy.  In patients who experience a worsening of renal function, discontinuation of ACE inhibitor therapy is usually not required provided there is symptomatic improvement of the heart failure and renal deterioration is well-tolerated.  Transient hypotension is also not a contraindication to further treatment with ACE inhibitors.

In addition, symptomatic and sometimes excessive hypotension can occur in susceptible individuals, particularly during the initiation of treatment, which may compromise renal and myocardial perfusion.  In patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF), treatment with ACE inhibitors may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and, rarely, renal failure, myocardial ischemia and death.  Therapy with ACE inhibitors should be initiated under very close medical supervision in patients with severe CHF, especially when accompanied by volume and/or sodium depletion.  Patients should be monitored closely for several hours after an initial dose until blood pressure has stabilized, and followed closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dosage of ACE inhibitor or diuretic is increased.  If feasible, the risk of severe hypotension may be minimized by reducing or temporarily withholding the dosing of diuretics and/or liberalizing dietary sodium intake for 2 to 3 days prior to starting ACE inhibitor therapy.  In patients who experience a worsening of renal function, discontinuation of ACE inhibitor therapy is usually not required provided there is symptomatic improvement of the heart failure and renal deterioration is well-tolerated.  Transient hypotension is also not a contraindication to further treatment with ACE inhibitors.

In addition, symptomatic and sometimes excessive hypotension can occur in susceptible individuals, particularly during the initiation of treatment, which may compromise renal and myocardial perfusion.  In patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF), treatment with ACE inhibitors may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and, rarely, renal failure, myocardial ischemia and death.  Therapy with ACE inhibitors should be initiated under very close medical supervision in patients with severe CHF, especially when accompanied by volume and/or sodium depletion.  Patients should be monitored closely for several hours after an initial dose until blood pressure has stabilized, and followed closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dosage of ACE inhibitor or diuretic is increased.  If feasible, the risk of severe hypotension may be minimized by reducing or temporarily withholding the dosing of diuretics and/or liberalizing dietary sodium intake for 2 to 3 days prior to starting ACE inhibitor therapy.  In patients who experience a worsening of renal function, discontinuation of ACE inhibitor therapy is usually not required provided there is symptomatic improvement of the heart failure and renal deterioration is well-tolerated.  Transient hypotension is also not a contraindication to further treatment with ACE inhibitors.

In addition, symptomatic and sometimes excessive hypotension can occur in susceptible individuals, particularly during the initiation of treatment, which may compromise renal and myocardial perfusion.  In patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF), treatment with ACE inhibitors may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and, rarely, renal failure, myocardial ischemia and death.  Therapy with ACE inhibitors should be initiated under very close medical supervision in patients with severe CHF, especially when accompanied by volume and/or sodium depletion.  Patients should be monitored closely for several hours after an initial dose until blood pressure has stabilized, and followed closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dosage of ACE inhibitor or diuretic is increased.  If feasible, the risk of severe hypotension may be minimized by reducing or temporarily withholding the dosing of diuretics and/or liberalizing dietary sodium intake for 2 to 3 days prior to starting ACE inhibitor therapy.  In patients who experience a worsening of renal function, discontinuation of ACE inhibitor therapy is usually not required provided there is symptomatic improvement of the heart failure and renal deterioration is well-tolerated.  Transient hypotension is also not a contraindication to further treatment with ACE inhibitors.  After blood pressure stabilizes, therapy can usually be reinstated with caution, although a lower dosage of the ACE inhibitor and/or dosage reduction or discontinuation of concomitantly administered diuretics may be necessary.', '3', 'Schwartz D, Averbuch M, Pines A, et al.

If concomitant diuretics and/or dietary sodium restriction are employed, reducing or temporarily withholding the dosing of diuretics and/or liberalizing dietary sodium intake for 2 to 3 days in advance can help minimize the risk of severe hypotension in patients who are able to tolerate such adjustments.  ACE inhibitors should also be used cautiously in patients in whom excessive hypotension may have serious consequences, such as patients with coronary or cerebrovascular insufficiency.
