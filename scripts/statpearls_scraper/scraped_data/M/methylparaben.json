    "clinical_significance": "Understanding the impact of environmental toxins on fertility is clinically significant, as it is preventable and, in some instances, modifiable once exposed. Strategies to reduce toxin exposure include avoiding the following:\n\nSmoking and vaping in the home or vehicle\nConsuming raw or undercooked meat, poultry, eggs, and seafood\nConsuming soft cheeses, such as feta, brie, and Roquefort\nConsuming cold lunch meats, such as hot dogs and deli meats\nConsuming fish high in mercury levels, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, tilefish, and albacore tuna\nConsuming unwashed fruits and vegetables\n\nTreatment and Prevention\n\nToxicity can sometimes be treated, particularly in cases of heavy metal exposure. In addition, with cigarette smoking, a return to normal fecundity is noted with smoking cessation, making cessation counseling of utmost importance during an evaluation for infertility.\n[41]\nIn other cases, such as exposure to EDC, prevention is the primary aim.\n\nThe prevention of environmental toxin exposure comes from individual action and community and policy-level change. Reproductive health professionals are especially poised for exposure prevention, as they can identify at-risk patients during preconception counseling, perhaps even preventing prenatal exposure. Clinicians can avoid exposure through appropriate reporting and patient education. If a patient is found to have an exposure-related illness or suspected exposure based on screening, the individual should be referred to occupational medicine programs or an environmental health specialty unit.\n[42]\n\nSeveral regulatory bodies have been involved with regulations on controlling endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Examples include the European Food Safety Authority and the European Chemicals Regulation in the European Union. In the United States, a regulatory program called the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program has helped control the use and exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals. The Canadian Environmental Protection Act and the Japanese environmental regulations are other examples of regulatory and screening investigations.\n[4]\n\nLarge-scale prevention may ultimately involve policy change. Several academic societies, including the American Society of Reproductive Medicine and the Endocrine Society, have called for public policy change to regulate environmental toxin exposure. These statements urge the United States Environmental Protection Agency and other government agencies to analyze substances made available to the public for their effect on human health. Certain measures have already been implemented to reduce specific exposures, including the Food and Drug Administration's ban on certain endocrine-disrupting chemicals, such as diethylstilbestrol. Bisphenol A has also been regulated by banning its use in various early-life products, such as baby bottles and infant formula.\n[43]\n\nPatient education is crucial in minimizing exposure and can be achieved through counseling and distributing educational materials. A specific example includes a research study showing that transitioning a child's food consumption to an organic diet significantly reduced organophosphate pesticide metabolite concentration in the urine.\n[44]\nAnother study found that avoiding sources of bisphenol A, such as canned food, significantly reduced bisphenol A levels in study participants.\n[45]\nBased on these findings, dietary recommendations to reduce environmental toxin exposure include adopting a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, minimizing processed and fast foods, and avoiding products that contain endocrine-disrupting chemicals, such as bisphenol A.\n\nPhthalate use has increased in recent years, as these toxins are extensively used in plastic products and released into the environment. Multiple exposure pathways, such as inhalation and absorption through skin, have been observed. Although the health risks caused by phthalates are not clear, the oxidative stress and inflammation they cause may result in a prolonged time to achieve pregnancy in women. This effect was not associated with women receiving folic acid supplementation, suggesting that folic acid may regulate the infertility associated with phthalate exposure. Similarly, vitamin C may have antagonistic effects on the ovarian damage induced by dibutyl phthalate.\n[46]\n\nTo reduce exposure to environmental toxins, fruits and vegetables should be washed thoroughly to remove pesticide residues. Patients should be recommended to opt for fresh foods over processed or canned items to avoid endocrine-disrupting chemicals from plastic packaging and can linings. Oily fish and fatty meats should be avoided, as these can accumulate pesticides and heavy metals. Individuals are advised to drink from glass or hard plastic bottles rather than soft plastics, as flexible plastics can release endocrine-disrupting chemicals into beverages. Food should be heated in glass or china containers rather than soft plastic, and cling wrap should be avoided to prevent endocrine-disrupting chemicals from leaching into fatty foods. Indoor air quality is improved by opening windows and avoiding air fresheners, strong chemicals, and heavily scented products. Non-toxic, eco-friendly alternatives for gardening and household cleaning should be chosen, and labels on personal care items read, selecting products without parabens and other harmful additives. Finally, patients must be warned about products marketed as bisphenol A-free, as they may contain chemicals similar to BPS."
