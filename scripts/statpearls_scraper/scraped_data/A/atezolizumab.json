    "mechanism": "Many immune and tumor-infiltrating cells express programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), which negatively regulates the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes by binding to the programmed death-1 (PD-1) and B7.1 (CD80) receptors that cause suppression of T-cell migration, proliferation, and secretion of cytotoxic mediators, leading to inhibited tumor cell killing.\n[9]\n\nData from various clinical trials have shown that agents targeting the PD-L1/PD-1 molecular pathway can induce antitumor activity early and across multiple neoplastic conditions. Atezolizumab is a humanized monoclonal anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody that inhibits PD-L1–programmed death 1 (PD-1) PD-L1–B7-1 signaling, preventing tumor-specific cytotoxic T-cell immunity and allowing (or inducing) the normal pathway of tumor cell killing to proceed.\n[10]",
    "administration": "Available Dosage Forms and Strengths\n\nAtezolizumab is available as a 15-mL subcutaneous injection containing 1,875 mg of atezolizumab and 30,000 units of hyaluronidase (TECENTRIQ HYBREZA). Atezolizumab is also available in 2 intravenous, single-dose solutions:\n\nTECENTRIQ 840 mg/14 mL (60 mg/mL)\nTECENTRIQ 1200 mg/20 mL (60 mg/mL)\n\nAdult Dosage\n\nTECENTRIQ HYBREZA (SQ): Remove the vial from the refrigerator and allow the atezolizumab solution to acclimate to room temperature. Discard the vial if the solution is discolored, cloudy, or visible particles are observed. Do not freeze, shake, or dilute at any point in time. The unpunctured vial can be stored at room temperature under ambient lighting for a maximum of 4 hours before preparation for administration. After priming the administration needle, expel excess from the syringe to ensure it contains exactly 15 mL of solution and administer it immediately to avoid needle clogging.\n\nDo not store the prepared syringe attached to a primed subcutaneous administration set.\nThe capped syringe may be stored at room temperature (up to 25 °C in ambient room lighting) for up to 8 hours or in the refrigerator (2 °C to 8 °C) for up to 72 hours, allowing it to acclimate to room temperature before administration.\n\nTECENTRIQ (IV): Injection vials should be diluted with 0.9 % sodium chloride injection. Mix the solution with gentle inversion, and do not shake it. Administer the diluted solution immediately once dispensed. If the diluted infusion solution is not used immediately, store it at room temperature for no more than 6 hours from the dilution, including time for administering the infusion. The dilution can be refrigerated at 2 to 8 °C for no more than 24 hours after being prepared; it should not be frozen. The initial infusion should occur over 60 minutes; if this is well tolerated, subsequent doses can be administered over 30 minutes. Patients should be closely monitored for infusion-related reactions. Severe reactions are indications to temporarily interrupt, slow, or permanently discontinue the infusion.\n\nIV infusion (monotherapy)\n\nFor most indicated cancers, the dose is generally 1200 mg every 3 weeks. For unresectable or metastatic melanoma, the dose is 840 mg every 2 weeks. However, depending on the diagnosis and institution, the dose can vary from this standard regimen. The clinician should always consult the drug package insert and institutional protocols before determining a dosing regimen for any patient. The following dosing recommendations are valid unless disease progression (or recurrence) or unacceptable toxicity is encountered.\n\nMetastatic NSCLC:\n\n840 mg every 2 weeks, or\n1200 mg every 3 weeks, or\n1680 mg every 4 weeks\n\nAdjuvant treatment of NSCLC: Up to 1 year\n\n840 mg every 2 weeks, or\n1200 mg every 3 weeks, or\n1680 mg every 4 weeks\n\nAdults with ASPS:\n\n840 mg every 2 weeks, or\n1200 mg every 3 weeks, or\n1680 mg every 4 weeks\n\nIV infusion (in combination therapy)\n\nNSCLC: Administer atezolizumab before chemotherapy and bevacizumab when given on the same day until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n840 mg every 2 weeks, or\n1200 mg every 3 weeks, or\n1680 mg every 4 weeks\n\nSCLC: Administer atezolizumab before chemotherapy when given on the same day.\n\n840 mg every 2 weeks, or\n1200 mg every 3 weeks, or\n1680 mg every 4 weeks\n\nHCC: Administer atezolizumab before bevacizumab when given on the same day. Bevacizumab is administered at 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks.\n\n840 mg every 2 weeks, or\n1200 mg every 3 weeks, or\n1680 mg every 4 weeks\n\nMelanoma: Administer atezolizumab with cobimetinib 60 mg orally once daily (21 days on and 7 days off) and vemurafenib 720 mg orally twice daily. Before initiating atezolizumab, patients should receive a 28-day treatment cycle of cobimetinib 60 mg orally once daily (21 days on and 7 days off) and vemurafenib 960 mg orally twice daily from Days 1 to 21 and vemurafenib 720 mg orally twice daily from Days 22 to 28.\n\n840 mg every 2 weeks, or\n1200 mg every 3 weeks, or\n1680 mg every 4 weeks\n\nSQ injection\n\nThis is administered subcutaneously in the thigh over approximately 7 minutes every 3 weeks.\n\nNSCLC: Administer as monotherapy for up to 1 year unless there is disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nMetastatic NSCLC: Administer atezolizumab as monotherapy for up to 1 year until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nNSCLC: Administer atezolizumab before chemotherapy and bevacizumab when given on the same day. Treat until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nSCLC: Administer atezolizumab before chemotherapy when given on the same day. Treat until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nHCC: Administer atezolizumab before bevacizumab when given on the same day. Bevacizumab is administered intravenously at 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Treat until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nMelanoma: Before initiating atezolizumab, patients should receive the following 28-day cobimetinib and vemurafenib treatment cycle. Treat until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nDays 1 to 21: cobimetinib 60 mg orally once daily in combination with 960 mg of oral vemurafenib twice daily\nDays 22 to 28: withhold cobimetinib and administer vemurafenib 720 mg orally twice daily\n\nASPS: Administer atezolizumab monotherapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nSpecific Patient Populations\n\nPregnancy considerations:\nBefore starting treatment with atezolizumab, confirm the pregnancy status of women who could become pregnant. Inform these women about the possible risks to a fetus and recommend the use of effective contraception during treatment and for 5 months following the last dose. There is a lack of data regarding its use in pregnancy. However, based on its mechanism of action, it can potentially cause fetal harm. Animal studies show that blocking the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway could enhance the possibility of immune-related rejection of the fetus, leading to fetal death.\n\nBreastfeeding considerations:\nBreastfeeding is not recommended while on therapy with atezolizumab and at least for 5 months after the last dose.\n\nPediatric patients:\nThe dosage for children aged 2 and older with ASPS is 15 mg/kg (maximum 1200 mg) every 3 weeks.",
    "adverse_effects": "As with other approved PD-1/PD-L1-targeted therapies, the administration of atezolizumab can be associated with immune-mediated adverse events (imAEs), which can be severe or fatal and involve any organ system manifesting as described below.\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n\nInfusion-related reactions\n\nAnaphylaxis and hypersensitivity\n\nImmune-mediated colitis\n\nImmune-mediated colitis is characterized by signs and symptoms of diarrhea or increased ostomy output, colitis, or perforation.

    "monitoring": "Patients receiving atezolizumab are at risk of developing immune-mediated adverse reactions anytime during therapy and after treatment discontinuation. Early identification and management of imAEs are crucial for patients undergoing atezolizumab therapy.\n[15]\n\nPatients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of exfoliative dermatological manifestations, autoimmune colitis, endocrinopathies, and immune-mediated neurological and cardiovascular involvement.\nLaboratory tests such as blood glucose level, renal function, liver function, and thyroid function should be performed at baseline before the initiation of treatment and during treatment to evaluate for new-onset diabetes and adverse reactions such as immune-mediated nephritis, immune-mediated hepatitis, and immune-mediated thyroid dysfunction, respectively.\nAtezolizumab must be held for patients experiencing grade 2 immune-mediated adverse reactions and should be permanently discontinued for grade 3 and 4 immune-mediated adverse reactions, unless indicated by the oncology team.",
