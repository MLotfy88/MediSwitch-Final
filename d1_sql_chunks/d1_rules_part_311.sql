Antidepressants including SSRIs and SNRIs can reduce seizure threshold.Coadministration of SSRIs or SNRIs with some anticonvulsants, particularly carbamazepine, eslicarbazepine, oxcarbazepine and valproic acid, may increase the risk of hyponatremia. The risk appears to be dose-related, and elderly patients and patients who are volume depleted (e.g., diuretic use) may be at greater risk.', 'DDInter', 1767317476, 'SSRIs and SNRIs should be avoided in patients with unstable epilepsy, and used cautiously in patients with epilepsy controlled with anticonvulsant medications. Treatment with SSRIs and SNRIs should be discontinued if seizures develop or seizure frequency increases. Patients receiving SSRIs or SNRIs with anticonvulsants, particularly carbamazepine, eslicarbazepine, oxcarbazepine and/or valproic acid, should also have serum sodium levels measured regularly and monitored for development of hyponatremia, particularly when higher dosages of these medications are used. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include nausea, vomiting, headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, malaise, lethargy, muscle weakness or spasms, and unsteadiness. In more severe and/or acute cases, hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death may occur.', 'Antagonism', 'SSRIs and SNRIs should be avoided in patients with unstable epilepsy, and used cautiously in patients with epilepsy controlled with anticonvulsant medications.', NULL, NULL, 'Moderate', 'pharmacodynamic');
