Preferred in-lab testing for those with suspected concomitant respiratory disorder (e.g. COPD), concomitant sleep disorder(e.g. narcolepsy), mild disease, negative or inconclusive home testing\nHome sleep apnea testing: Good for patients with high pretest probability for moderate to severe uncomplicated OSA.",
