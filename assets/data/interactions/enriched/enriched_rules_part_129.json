Patients with sustained transaminase elevations of greater than 5 times the ULN should also have treatment discontinued. Patients with prolonged elevations of serum transaminases should be evaluated for other possible causes. Also consider dosage adjustment or discontinuation of any coadministered medication that is known to affect the liver.",
