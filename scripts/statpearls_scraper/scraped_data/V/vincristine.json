    "indications": "Certain medical conditions and factors may preclude using vincristine treatment in patients. Among these contraindications, a few are mentioned below.\n\nCharcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome:\nThis hereditary disorder affects the peripheral nerves and causes progressive muscle weakness and sensory loss. Vincristine can exacerbate the symptoms of this condition and induce severe neurotoxicity. Hence, vincristine is contraindicated for patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome or a family history of this disorder.\n[21]\n[22]\n[21]\n\nHypersensitivity:\nVincristine can cause hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions) in some patients. The symptoms include skin rash, itching, hives, flushing, fever, chills, dyspnea (difficulty breathing), bronchospasm (narrowing of the airways), anaphylaxis (severe allergic reactions), and angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat). These reactions can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention.\n\nBlack Box Warnings and Precautions\n\nVincristine sulfate injection should be administered to patients by healthcare professionals experienced in its administration. The dosage should be determined based on the patient's actual or ideal BW, whichever is less.\n\nExtravasation:\nThe IV needle or catheter must be in the proper position before infusion or injection of any medication. Incorrect positioning can result in medication leakage into the surrounding tissue during IV administration. Medication leakage can cause significant irritation; therefore, injection or infusion must be promptly discontinued if extravasation occurs.\n\nFor IV use only:\nVincristine is exclusively indicated for IV use, and it can be fatal if administered through any other route. The administration of vincristine via intrathecal routes typically leads to fatal outcomes. Therefore, all syringes containing vincristine must be properly labeled and equipped with the provided auxiliary sticker. The auxiliary label must clearly state: \"For IV use only. Fatal if given by other routes.\"",
    "mechanism": "Vincristine belongs to the vinca alkaloid class of chemotherapy drugs and acts as a microtubule-disrupting agent. Vincristine's mechanism of action primarily centers on its capacity to disrupt microtubule dynamics, particularly during the M and S phases, which is essential for cell division and several cellular processes. Another mechanism of action of vincristine includes interfering with nucleic acid and protein synthesis by blocking glutamic acid utilization.\n[9]\n\nVincristine's mechanism of action is characterized by several critical processes, as mentioned below, that collectively disrupt cancer cell growth and division.\n\nMicrotubule binding:\nVincristine specifically binds to the plus ends of microtubules, dynamic protein polymers composed of tubulin subunits. Microtubules are essential cytoskeleton components and have pivotal roles in cell division, including mitosis and meiosis, intracellular transport, and the maintenance of cellular shape.\n\nInhibition of microtubule polymerization:\nVincristine interferes with microtubule polymerization by binding to tubulin subunits within the microtubule lattice. This binding prevents the addition of new tubulin subunits to the growing microtubule, thereby inhibiting microtubule elongation.\n[10]\n\nDisruption of mitotic spindle formation:\nDuring the mitosis phase of cell division, microtubules form the mitotic spindle, a dynamic structure responsible for segregating chromosomes into daughter cells. Vincristine's interference with microtubule dynamics disrupts the formation and functionality of the mitotic spindle.\n\nCell cycle arrest:\nDue to the disrupted spindle formation caused by vincristine, treated cells cannot progress through the cell cycle. This results in cell cycle arrest at the metaphase stage, where chromosomes fail to align and segregate correctly.\n\nInduction of apoptosis:\nProlonged metaphase arrest triggers a cellular response that ultimately leads to apoptosis or programmed cell death. The inability of the cell to complete mitosis due to microtubule disruption initiates a cascade of events culminating in cell death.\n\nEffect on rapidly dividing cells:\nVincristine's mechanism of action selectively targets rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, as they heavily depend on adequately functioning microtubules during cell division. Normal, non-dividing cells are relatively less affected, contributing to the reduction of certain adverse effects.\n\nPharmacokinetics\n\nA comprehensive understanding of vincristine's pharmacokinetics is essential for optimizing its dosage, administration, and monitoring, thus ensuring the safety and effectiveness of cancer treatment.\n\nAbsorption\n: Vincristine is administered via an IV route and is rapidly and completely absorbed into the systemic circulation. The peak plasma concentration is reached within minutes after injection.\n[11]\n\nDistribution\n: Vincristine has a substantial volume of distribution, ranging from 2.3 to 8 L/kg in adults and 1.5 to 4.9 L/kg in children.\n[12]\nThe drug exhibits high binding affinity to plasma proteins, primarily albumin, and blood cells, especially platelets. Vincristine has limited penetration through the blood-brain barrier and tends to accumulate in the cerebrospinal fluid. The drug is distributed to various tissues and organs, including the liver, kidney, spleen, lung, heart, and muscle.\n[11]\nVincristine exhibits a strong affinity for tubulin, a protein essential for forming microtubules, which are involved in cell division and transport.\n\nMetabolism\n: Vincristine undergoes extensive metabolism in the liver, primarily mediated by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system, notably CYP3A4 and CYP3A5.\n[11]\nThe primary metabolite is 4-O-desacetyl-vincristine, which possesses specific antitumor activity but is notably less potent than the parent drug. Other minor metabolites include\nN\n-deformyl-vincristine,\nN\n-deformyl-4-O-desacetyl-vincristine, and 4-O-desacetyl-\nN\n-deformyl-vincristine. The metabolism of vincristine is influenced by the genetic polymorphisms of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 enzymes, as well as by drug interactions involving inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes.\n[12]\n\nElimination\n: Vincristine is primarily eliminated in the bile and feces as metabolites.\n[13]\nOnly 20% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine, which is a relatively small amount.\n[12]\nThe elimination half-life of vincristine follows a biphasic pattern, with an initial rapid phase lasting approximately 5 minutes and a subsequent slower terminal phase of about 85 minutes in adults and 25 minutes in children.\n[12]\nVincristine exhibits a clearance rate of approximately 146 mL/min, which can vary significantly among individuals and is influenced by factors such as age, body weight (BW), liver function, renal function, and concurrent medication usage. The elimination half-life of vincristine typically ranges from 10 to 155 hours.\n[14]",
    "administration": "Dosage Form\n\nVincristine is available in an IV formulation.\n\nStrength\n\nVincristine is available in a concentration of 1 mg/mL.\n\nAdult Dosage\n\nIn the treatment of acute leukemia, vincristine is administered as per the regimen mentioned below.\n\nInduction phase: 1.4 mg/m\n2\non days 1, 8, 15, and 22.\nConsolidation phase: 1.4 mg/m\n2\non days 1, 8, 15, and 22.\nMaintenance phase: 1.4 mg/m\n2\nevery 3 months for 2.5 years.\n\nVincristine should be administered via IV as a brief 5- to 10-minute infusion. The Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) and the World Health Organization (WHO) strongly recommend vincristine be dispensed in a 25 to 50 ml mini bag. If a mini bag is unavailable, vincristine may be administered as a slow 1-minute IV push. Notably, administration via any other route can lead to fatal consequences. For patients receiving medications intended for CNS administration, it is essential to administer vincristine separately and not simultaneously.\n[15]\n\nAs vincristine is a vesicant, it is imperative to exercise utmost caution to ensure the correct needle or catheter placement both before and during IV infusion to prevent extravasation. In cases of extravasation, it is imperative to promptly halt and disconnect the infusion while leaving the needle or cannula in its current position. To minimize potential complications, the extravasated solution should be gently aspirated without flushing the line. Subsequently, the hyaluronidase antidote should be administered, the needle or cannula removed, and a warm and dry compression applied for 20 minutes, 4 times a day, during the first 2 days following the extravasation. Finally, reevaluation should occur, and the remaining vincristine dose should be administered via IV route through a distinct vein.\n[16]\n[17]\n\nSpecific Patient Populations\n\nHepatic impairment:\nVincristine undergoes substantial metabolism within the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system, primarily mediated by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. This metabolic pathway can be compromised in patients with hepatic dysfunction or those concurrently using potent enzyme inhibitors. Therefore, if the direct bilirubin level exceeds 3 mg/dL, a 50% reduction in the vincristine dose is recommended. Vincristine should be used cautiously and under vigilant monitoring for patients with obstructive jaundice or significant hepatic impairment.\n\nRenal impairment\n: Vincristine is primarily eliminated as metabolites in the bile and feces, with only a minor fraction of the drug being eliminated unchanged in the urine. Therefore, dosage adjustment of vincristine is generally unnecessary in patients with renal impairment. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that vincristine can induce neurotoxicity, which can be exacerbated by renal failure.\n\nPregnancy considerations\n: According to data from nonclinical studies, administering vincristine to pregnant or potentially pregnant women can cause fetal harm. There are reports of fetal death, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, and congenital malformations associated with vincristine exposure during pregnancy. Therefore, females of reproductive potential should use effective contraception methods.\n\nBreastfeeding considerations\n: The excretion of this drug in human milk has not been established based on clinical data.\n\nPediatric patients\n: The vincristine dosage for children is typically calculated based on their body surface area (BSA) or BW, generally within the range of approximately 1.5 to 2 mg/m\n2\n. For pediatric patients with a body weight of 10 kg or less, the initial vincristine dosage should be 0.05 mg/kg, administered once a week. To prevent excessive toxicity, the maximum single dose of vincristine is capped at 2 mg, irrespective of BSA or BW. Pediatric patients are carefully monitored for vincristine-related neurotoxicity, and dosage adjustments may be considered to manage the adverse effects of the drug.\n\nOlder patients\n: The maximum single dose of vincristine for older patients is limited to 2 mg, irrespective of their BSA or BW, to avoid excessive toxicity. In older patients, the most frequently observed adverse effects of vincristine include neurotoxicity, constipation, alopecia, and myelosuppression.",
    "adverse_effects": "Vincristine exhibits various adverse effects that can affect multiple organ systems and vary in severity. Notable organ systems encompassed by vincristine's potential adverse effects include cardiovascular, CNS, dermatological, endocrine and metabolic, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, hepatic, renal, respiratory, neuromuscular, otic, and ophthalmic systems.\n\nSome adverse effects that can occur during vincristine administration, categorized by body system, are outlined below.\n[18]\n\nNeurotoxicity:\nThis is the most prevalent and dose-limiting adverse effect of vincristine, often manifesting as peripheral neuropathy, which can impact sensory, motor, and autonomic nerves.\n[19]\nThe symptoms of this condition include numbness, tingling, pain, weakness, difficulty walking or using the hands, loss of reflexes, constipation, urinary retention, orthostatic hypotension, and impotence. Neurotoxicity can also affect the CNS, causing seizures, confusion, hallucinations, depression, cranial nerve palsies, and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Neurotoxicity typically exhibits reversibility upon discontinuation or dose reduction of vincristine, although in some instances, it may persist for months or even years.\n\nMyelosuppression:\nMyelosuppression refers to the inhibition of bone marrow function, leading to a decreased production of blood cells. Vincristine can cause mild-to-moderate myelosuppression, mainly affecting platelets and white blood cells. The symptoms include bleeding, bruising, infection, fever, and anemia. Although myelosuppression is generally reversible following discontinuation or dose reduction of vincristine, in some cases, it may necessitate supportive measures such as blood transfusions or growth factor administration.\n\nAlopecia:\nAlopecia is characterized by hair loss from the scalp and other body areas. This condition can occur as an adverse effect of vincristine and result in partial or complete hair loss in a majority of patients. Typically, hair regrowth occurs after the discontinuation or completion of vincristine therapy, although it may exhibit a different color or texture.\n\nGastrointestinal toxicity:\nThis condition includes symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, mucositis characterized by inflammation of the mouth and throat, and anorexia characterized by loss of appetite. These effects are usually of mild-to-moderate severity and can often be effectively managed by the use of antidiarrheals, antiemetics, which are medications to prevent nausea and vomiting, analgesics, which are pain relievers, and nutritional support.\n\nOther adverse effects:\nVincristine can also cause other less common or rare adverse effects, such as hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions), extravasation (leakage of the drug into the surrounding tissues), phlebitis (inflammation of the veins), skin rash, photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight), headache, dizziness, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), blurred vision, hypertension (high blood pressure), arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), cardiomyopathy (heart muscle damage), pulmonary edema (fluid accumulation in the lungs),  hepatotoxicity (liver damage), nephrotoxicity (kidney damage), pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), hyperuricemia (high levels of uric acid in the blood), gout (a type of arthritis caused by uric acid crystals in the joints), and secondary malignancies (new cancers caused by chemotherapy).\n\nDrug-Drug Interactions\n\nVincristine can interact with numerous other drugs metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4 or transported by the protein P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Such interactions can either elevate or diminish the blood concentrations of vincristine, thereby influencing its efficacy and toxicity. Some examples of drugs that can interact with vincristine are mentioned below.\n\nCYP3A4 inhibitors:\nThese drugs inhibit the activity of CYP3A4 and reduce the metabolism of vincristine.\n[20]\nThis can lead to elevated plasma concentrations, heightening the risk of neurotoxicity and myelosuppression. Some examples of CYP3A4 inhibitors are ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, fluconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, telithromycin, diltiazem, verapamil, grapefruit juice, and cimetidine. When these drugs are coadministered with vincristine, it may be necessary to reduce the vincristine dose or extend the interval between doses.\n\nCYP3A4 inducers:\nThese drugs enhance the activity of CYP3A4, leading to increased metabolism of vincristine. Consequently, this can result in lower plasma concentrations and decreased vincristine efficacy. Some examples of CYP3A4 inducers are rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, St John's wort, and efavirenz. When coadministered with these drugs, it may be necessary to consider increasing the vincristine dose or shortening the interval between doses.\n\nP-gp inhibitors:\nThese drugs inhibit the function of P-gp and diminish the efflux of vincristine from cells. Consequently, this can lead to higher intracellular concentrations, potentially increasing efficacy and toxicity.\n\nP-gp inducers:\nThese drugs stimulate the expression or function of P-gp, leading to increased efflux of vincristine from cells. This can result in lower intracellular concentrations and decreased efficacy of vincristine.",
    "monitoring": "Patients receiving vincristine should undergo monitoring for several critical aspects, including the infusion site, the patient's neurological functions, and various laboratory values. Regular monitoring of laboratory values is essential, including serum electrolytes, such as serum sodium and serum uric acid, hepatic function assessments, and a complete blood count with a differential. In addition, vigilant monitoring for signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy is crucial.",
    "toxicity": "The administration of vincristine should never be considered an emergency, as several fatal cases have occurred due to the inadvertent administration of vincristine via the incorrect route or at a rapid rate. Therefore, nurses or other healthcare providers responsible for administering vincristine should consistently verify the label for the prescribed dose, duration, and route of administration.\n\nNeurotoxicity:\nThe most prevalent and dose-limiting toxicity associated with vincristine is neurotoxicity, which can impact the peripheral, central, and autonomic nervous systems.\n[22]\nThe signs and symptoms of neurotoxicity include numbness, tingling, pain, weakness, difficulty walking or using the hands, loss of reflexes, constipation, urinary retention, and orthostatic hypotension. Neurotoxicity typically exhibits reversibility upon discontinuation or dose reduction of vincristine, although in some instances, it may persist for months or even years.\n\nManagement of Overdose\n\nIf severe or progressive neurotoxicity ensues, it is advisable to either reduce the dose of vincristine or discontinue its use. Symptomatic treatment may include analgesics (pain relievers), anticonvulsants (seizure medications), antidepressants, laxatives, anticholinergics (drugs that block the action of acetylcholine), and physical therapy. Certain medicines that have the potential to exacerbate neurotoxicity, such as isoniazid, phenytoin, metronidazole, and erythromycin, should either be avoided or used cautiously."
