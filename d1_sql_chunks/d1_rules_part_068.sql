There may be a theoretical risk of increased seizure potential when used with other agents that can lower the seizure threshold such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI antidepressants or anorectics), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, neuroleptic agents, central nervous system stimulants, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, other tricyclic compounds (e.g., cyclobenzaprine, phenothiazines), carbapenems, cholinergic agents, fluoroquinolones, interferons, chloroquine, mefloquine, lindane, and theophylline. Ginkgo products may contain varying amounts of 4''-O-methylpyridoxine (ginkgotoxin), a known neurotoxin found primarily in ginkgo biloba seeds but also detected in lesser amounts in the leaves. In vivo, 4''-O-methylpyridoxine competes with vitamin B6, which causes an indirect inhibition of glutamate decarboxylase and subsequent decrease in the formation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain. There have been published case reports of generalized convulsions and vomiting within several hours after ingestion of large amounts of ginkgo nuts/seeds, including in young children and healthy individuals with no known personal or family history of epilepsy.', NULL, 'Patients should consult a healthcare provider before taking any herbal or alternative medicine.', NULL, 'Patients should consult a healthcare provider before taking any herbal or alternative medicine.
