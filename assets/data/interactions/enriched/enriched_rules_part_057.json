Vandetanib should not be started if baseline QTcF is greater than 450 ms, and treatment should be interrupted if QTcF is greater than 500 ms. Treatment may resume when QTcF returns to less than 450 ms, but at a reduced dosage. In addition, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and/or hypocalcemia must be corrected prior to vandetanib administration. Since diarrhea is a common side effect of vandetanib and may cause electrolyte imbalances, ECG and electrolyte levels should also be monitored more frequently when diarrhea develops. Vandetanib treatment should be stopped in the presence of severe diarrhea. Treatment may resume when diarrhea improves, but at a reduced dosage. Following any dosage reduction, or any interruption of treatment greater than 2 weeks, QT assessment and serum electrolytes should be conducted as described previously.

In patients with a history of hypertensive encephalopathy, more intensive monitoring is warranted due to increased risk for developing encephalopathy with even small increases in BP. If at any point BP is elevated and remains high, promptly seek assistance from practitioners experienced in BP management. Patients experiencing symptoms of a hypertensive crisis (e.g., chest pain, shortness of breath) or hypertensive encephalopathy (e.g., sudden severe headache, visual disturbances, seizures, diminished consciousness or focal neurological deficits) should be immediately referred for emergency care.",

      "effect": "RECOMMENDED: The effectiveness of estrogen-containing oral contraceptives may be impaired by concomitant treatment with antimicrobial agents. Most antimicrobials, with the exception of the rifamycins and possibly griseofulvin, do not induce hepatic enzymes and have not been shown to significantly increase the clearance of oral contraceptive estrogens. Some investigators believe that antimicrobials interfere with the enterohepatic recirculation of estrogens by decreasing bacterial hydrolytic enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract that are responsible for regenerating parent estrogen molecules following first-pass metabolism. It is possible that a small number of women may be more susceptible to contraceptive failure and, consequently, are more sensitive to the effects of antimicrobials on estrogen disposition in vivo, but risk factors or genetic predispositions have yet to be identified.",
      "management_text": "Until further data are available, women using oral contraceptives should be advised of the risk of breakthrough bleeding and unintended pregnancy during concomitant antimicrobial therapy. Alternative or additional methods of birth control should be considered during and for at least one week beyond the last dose of short-term antimicrobial therapy, and for at least the initial weeks of long-term antimicrobial therapy when risk may be the greatest.",

Since sodium nitrite can cause serious hypotension and methemoglobin formation, patients may be at increased risk for complications related to inadequate perfusion and oxygenation.",
      "management_text": "Sodium nitrite should be used with caution in the presence of concomitant antihypertensive agents, diuretics, vasodilators, or PDE5 inhibitors. Hemodynamics should be monitored during and after administration of sodium nitrite, and the infusion rate decreased if significant hypotension occurs. In addition, methemoglobin levels should be monitored and oxygen administered during treatment whenever possible.",

      "effect": "Limited data suggest that patients receiving beta-blockers may have an increased risk of severe hypotensive and/or hypersensitivity reactions to parenteral iodinated contrast media. In addition, allergic/anaphylactoid reactions in these patients may be more difficult to treat.",
      "management_text": "Patients who have received beta-blockers should be closely monitored for adverse reactions to iodinated contrast media. If anaphylaxis occurs, clinicians should be aware that beta-blockers may attenuate the response to epinephrine. Thus, larger doses of epinephrine may be necessary to overcome the bronchospasm, although such large doses can also cause excessive alpha-adrenergic stimulation resulting in hypertension, reflex bradycardia, heart block, and possible potentiation of bronchospasm. Alternative treatments recommended include vigorous supportive care (e.g., fluids) and the use of parenteral beta-agonists for bronchospasm and norepinephrine for hypotension.",

Coadministration with antihypertensives and other hypotensive agents, in particular vasodilators and alpha-blockers, may result in additive effects on blood pressure and orthostasis.",
      "management_text": "Caution and close monitoring for development of hypotension is advised during coadministration of these agents. Avoid alcohol in patients receiving vasodilating antihypertensive drugs. Patients should be advised to avoid rising abruptly from a sitting or recumbent position and to notify their physician if they experience dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope, orthostasis, or tachycardia.",
