The risk is thought to extend to teriflunomide, its principal active metabolite, because recommended dosages of both result in a similar range of plasma concentrations of teriflunomide. Serious infections including sepsis, as well as opportunistic infections like Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis, and aspergillosis have been reported with the use of leflunomide, particularly in patients on concomitant hematotoxic therapy. Agents that may be significantly immuno- or myelosuppressive include antineoplastic agents, radiation, zidovudine, linezolid, some antirheumatic agents, high dosages of corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic agents , and long-term topical or inhaled corticosteroids. Rare cases of pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia have also occurred with leflunomide alone, but were most frequent in the presence of concomitant or recent use of methotrexate or other myelotoxic agents. Due to the prolonged elimination half-life of leflunomide's active metabolite, an interaction may occur even when hematotoxic agents are initiated after the discontinuation of leflunomide.
