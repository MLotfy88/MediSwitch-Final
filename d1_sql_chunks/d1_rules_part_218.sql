The exact mechanism of interaction is unclear. Certain systemic reactions stemming from parenteral iron therapy are thought to be mediated by inflammatory substances such as bradykinin in response to iron-catalyzed generation of toxic free radicals. Since ACE inhibitors decrease the breakdown of kinins, it is conceivable that they may potentiate these reactions. Anaphylactic-type reactions, including fatalities, have followed the parenteral administration of iron dextran. Such reactions occur most often within the first several minutes of administration and are generally characterized by sudden onset of respiratory difficulty and/or cardiovascular collapse. The extent of risk for anaphylactic-type reactions following exposure to any specific iron dextran product is unknown, but may vary among the products due to differences in chemical characteristics.', NULL, 'Patients should be closely monitored during and after parenteral administration of iron dextran, regardless of whether they are being treated with an ACE inhibitor.', NULL, 'Patients should be closely monitored during and after parenteral administration of iron dextran, regardless of whether they are being treated with an ACE inhibitor.

Resuscitation techniques and personnel trained in the detection and treatment of anaphylactic-type reactions should be readily available. Prior to the first therapeutic dose, a test dose corresponding to 25 mg iron should be injected gradually. Although anaphylactic reactions are usually evident within a few minutes, observe patients for at least one hour before administering the remainder of the therapeutic dose. Administration must be stopped immediately if signs of an anaphylactoid reaction are observed. Patients should also be closely monitored during each subsequent administration of iron dextran. Fatal reactions have occurred following the test dose and also in situations where the test dose was tolerated.
