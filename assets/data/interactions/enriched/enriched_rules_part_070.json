Serotonin syndrome is a rare but serious and potentially fatal condition thought to result from hyperstimulation of brainstem 5-HT1A and 2A receptors. Symptoms of the serotonin syndrome may include mental status changes such as irritability, altered consciousness, confusion, hallucinations, and coma; autonomic dysfunction such as tachycardia, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, shivering, blood pressure lability, and mydriasis; neuromuscular abnormalities such as hyperreflexia, myoclonus, tremor, rigidity, and ataxia; and gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Since many serotonergic agents can also cause central nervous system depression, concomitant use with opioids may result in increased sedation and impairment of judgment, thinking, and psychomotor skills.", "source": "DDInter", "management_text": "Caution is advised when opioids are used concomitantly with serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), other antidepressants/psychotropic agents (e.g., amoxapine, buspirone, lithium, maprotiline, mirtazepine, nefazodone, trazodone, vilazodone), 5-HT1 receptor agonists (triptans), 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, cyclobenzaprine, dextromethorphan, 5-hydroxytryptophan, and St. John's wort.

Moderately ill patients may also benefit from the administration of a serotonin antagonist (e.g., cyproheptadine, chlorpromazine).

Patients should be closely monitored for symptoms of the serotonin syndrome during treatment. Particular caution is warranted when initiating or increasing the dosages of these agents. In addition, the potential risk for serotonin syndrome should be considered even when administering serotonergic agents sequentially, as some agents may demonstrate a prolonged elimination half-life. If serotonin syndrome develops or is suspected during the course of therapy, all serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately and supportive care rendered as necessary. Moderately ill patients may also benefit from the administration of a serotonin antagonist (e.g., cyproheptadine, chlorpromazine). Severe cases should be managed under consultation with a toxicologist and may require sedation, neuromuscular paralysis, intubation, and mechanical ventilation in addition to the other measures. Due to the potential for additive effects on the QT interval, ECG monitoring may also be appropriate when 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are used with certain antidepressants or lithium.
