    "clinical_significance": "Progesterone can be useful for the identification of various clinical complications and diagnoses. Often, progesterone is combined with estrogen to be used as a contraceptive and regulate pregnancy timing or induce withdrawal bleeding.\n[8]\n[21]\n[8]\nIt also can be used to treat secondary amenorrhea, anovulation, and endometrial hyperplasia. Dysfunction vaginal bleeding, especially occurring in adolescents or postmenopausal women, can often be treated by progesterone administration.\n[21]\nThese indications are related to the reproductive effects of progesterone; however, progesterone can be used for non-reproductive applications too. For example, clinicians have used it to treat hypertension and COPD. Additionally, there are citations of its use to treat drug dependence also, specifically cocaine and nicotine.\n[2]\n[21]\n\nChronic use of progesterone clinically can cause one or many adverse effects. Some common side effects include\n[21]\n:\n\nAbdominal cramps\nBack pain\nBreast tenderness\nHypotension and dizziness\nHypercoagulant state\nVaginal bleeding"
