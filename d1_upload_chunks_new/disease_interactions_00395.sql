Patients treated with diet plus a fixed dosage of either tolbutamide (a sulfonylurea) or phenformin (a biguanide) for 5 to 8 years had a cardiovascular mortality rate approximately 2.5 times that of patients treated with diet alone, resulting in discontinuation of both these treatments in the study.  Despite controversy regarding interpretation of these results, clinicians and patients should be aware of the potential risk when making treatment decisions for diabetes, particularly in the presence of underlying cardiovascular disease.
