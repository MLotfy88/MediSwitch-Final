(Mauriceau maneuver) - stabilize with other hand/forearm on fetal back and shoulders - avoid excessive angulation or traction of fetal body.\nIf fetal head becomes entrapped, administer\nterbutaline\n(0.25mg SQ\nor\n2.5-10 μg/min IV) to relax uterus\nNitroglycerin\n(50 to 200 mcg IV) is an alternative.",
