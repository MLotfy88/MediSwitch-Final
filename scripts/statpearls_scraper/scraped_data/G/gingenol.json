    "clinical_significance": "As a widely studied biomarker, adiponectin has been shown to play a role in various endocrine and metabolic disorders. Continued research regarding the role it plays as a biomarker has the potential to elucidate further the pathogenesis and treatment of disease. Associations between adiponectin and these various types of dysfunction are listed below.\n\nBody Weight\nStudies demonstrate that obese patients have decreased levels of mRNA and serum levels of adiponectin. Conversely, these levels are increased in extremely lean patients suffering from conditions such as anorexia nervosa. Various cross-sectional studies have established an inverse relationship between adiponectin serum levels and BMI. Notably, an even stronger inverse relationship exists between adiponectin serum levels and fat mass. Weight loss through means such as diet and exercise and bariatric surgery has resulted in increased plasma levels of adiponectin in patients.\n[13]\n\nInsulin Resistance\n\nStudies involving rodent models have demonstrated the role of adiponectin in promoting insulin sensitization. Moreover, numerous positive correlations between insulin resistance and hypoadiponectinemia have been established in humans. Hypoadiponectinemia is a feature in pathologies such as gestational diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and diabetes associated with lipodystrophy. Further, low adiponectin levels have been demonstrated in patients with insulin resistance regardless of obesity.\n\nStrong genetic associations between adiponectin levels and insulin resistance have also been established. For instance, a genetic polymorphism on chromosome 3 resulting in hypoadiponectinemia increases susceptibility to the development of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Adiponectin has become such a powerful clinical biomarker that low levels of it predict the future onset of insulin resistance. This may explain why thiazolidinediones and PPARS-gamma agonists are the most potent insulin sensitizer drugs in our diabetic armamentarium, and adiponectin upregulation potentially mediates this effect. This benefit also extends to patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.\n[13]\n[14]\n\nLipodystrophy\n\nAdiponectin has also been shown to have significant associations with lipodystrophy. This is particularly important as metabolic derangements like insulin resistance, diabetes, and dyslipidemia often accompany lipodystrophy. Congenital and HIV-related lipodystrophies are also associated with low levels of adiponectin. Additionally, patients undergoing treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) have developed lipodystrophies. Studies demonstrate that HAART therapy lowers adiponectin in these patients, which suggests another inverse relationship between lipodystrophy and adiponectin levels.\n[13]\n\nAtherosclerosis\n\nVarious adipokines have been shown to mediate communication between adipose tissues, the heart, and different vasculatures. Moreover, there is an altered release of these adipokines in cardiovascular diseases and atherosclerosis. Adiponectin is a beneficial player in patients with atherosclerosis. For instance, low adiponectin levels predict a higher incidence of adverse cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarctions and atherosclerosis.\n\nSerum adiponectin levels have also been shown to have an inverse relationship with intimal thickness, an important biomarker of atherosclerosis. At the cellular level, adiponectin has also demonstrated a role in slowing the transformation of macrophages to foam cells and consequently stalling progression to atherosclerosis in animal models. However, serum adiponectin does not yet enjoy acceptance as a risk marker for ASCVD prediction or management.\n[13]\n\nMetabolic Syndrome\n\nAdiponectin is shown to play an important role in metabolic syndrome, a pathology characterized by continuous low-grade inflammation. For example, adiponectin levels demonstrate an inverse correlation with adiposity and proinflammatory cytokines in patients suffering from metabolic syndrome. Also, low levels of 'high molecular weight' adiponectin levels are associated with the future development of the metabolic syndrome.\n[9]\n\nThe above associations represent only several examples of the vast pool of pathologies that show links to adiponectin. Other pathologies include diabetic retinopathy and various cancers. Because adiponectin has such strong links to the pathogenesis of inflammatory disease, it could be a valuable biomarker and treatment target.\n\nConsequently, treatments have emerged that increase serum levels of adiponectin. Non-pharmaceutical treatments include sustained physical exercise and caloric restriction. Supplements include curcumin, capsaicin, and gingerol. Long-standing pharmaceutical therapies such as metformin and thiazolidinediones have demonstrated increased secretion of adiponectin and improved outcomes in patients suffering from chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Recombinant adiponectin and adiponectin agonists could be potential treatments for chronic inflammatory diseases.\n[9]"
