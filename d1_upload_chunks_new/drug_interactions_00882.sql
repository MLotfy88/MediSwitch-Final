The mechanism is NNRTI induction of methadone metabolism via CYP450 3A4. In 11 patients on stable methadone maintenance therapy, initiation of antiretroviral therapy containing efavirenz (600 mg once a day) resulted in decreases in mean methadone peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of 48% and 57%, respectively, compared to baseline. Nine patients developed symptoms consistent with methadone withdrawal an average of 8 to 10 days after start of efavirenz, which required a 22% mean increase in methadone dosage. In a similar study using nevirapine (200 mg once daily for 2 weeks followed by 200 mg twice daily), the reduction in mean methadone Cmax and AUC was 36% and 52%, respectively, in 8 patients stabilized on methadone treatment. Withdrawal symptoms occurred in six patients 8 to 10 days after start of nevirapine, and methadone dosage was subsequently increased an average of 16%.

Thus, if NNRTI therapy is discontinued due to adverse events or antiretroviral failure, methadone dosage should be gradually reduced over 2 to 3 weeks to pre-NNRTI levels. For patients treated with efavirenz, clinicians must also bear in mind that neurological adverse effects such as dizziness, headache, insomnia, vivid dreams, nightmares, and agitation may occur in up to 25% of patients shortly (within the first several days) after starting efavirenz.
