    "clinical_significance": "Dietary iron deficiency affects more than 1.6 billion people globally. It is more prevalent in resource-limited areas but still affects approximately 10% of toddlers, young girls, and women of childbearing age in the US and Canada. Iron deficiency progresses through stages, from asymptomatic iron depletion to iron deficiency anemia. Iron toxicity occurs only with excess supplement consumption, including accidental ingestions, and in genetic conditions causing iron overload, such as hemochromatosis. Because the body absorbs less iron when stores are adequate, toxicity is unlikely to occur solely by eating iron-rich foods. See StatPearls companion topics \"\nIron Deficiency Anemia\n,\" \"\nChronic Iron Deficiency\n,\" and \"\nIron Supplementation\n.\""
