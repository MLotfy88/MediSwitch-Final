MAO and COMT are the two major enzymatic pathways involved in the metabolism of catecholamines, thus inhibition of both systems may lead to excessive levels of norepinephrine and serotonin. Symptoms of the serotonin syndrome may include mental status changes such as irritability, altered consciousness, confusion, hallucination, and coma; autonomic dysfunction such as tachycardia, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, shivering, blood pressure lability, and mydriasis; neuromuscular abnormalities such as hyperreflexia, myoclonus, tremor, rigidity, and ataxia; and gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.', 'DDInter', 'In general, COMT inhibitors should not be used concurrently with nonselective MAO inhibitors or other agents that possess MAO inhibiting activity (e.g., furazolidone, linezolid, methylene blue, procarbazine).
