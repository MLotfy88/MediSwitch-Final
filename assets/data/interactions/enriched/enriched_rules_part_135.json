Leucopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and rarely, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, and aplastic anemia have been reported. Dose-related reductions in numbers of circulating total white cells, granulocytes, and lymphocytes may also occur. Treatment with azathioprine alone or in combination with other immunosuppressants, particularly corticosteroids, has been associated with increased susceptibility to infections including severe or atypical infection and reactivation with varicella zoster virus, hepatitis B, cytomegalovirus, and other infectious agents.",
