HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as sofosbuvir. As a prodrug nucleotide analog, Sofosbuvir is metabolized into its active form as the antiviral agent 2''-deoxy-2''-α-fluoro-β-C-methyluridine-5''-triphosphate (also known as GS-461203), which acts as a defective substrate for NS5B (non-structural protein 5B) [synthesis]. NS5B, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is essential for the transcription of Hepatitis C viral RNA and for its high replicative rate and genetic diversity [A19594]. Sofosbuvir and other direct acting antivirals are therefore very potent options for the treatment of Hepatitis C, as they exhibit a high barrier to the development of resistance [A19593]. This is an important advantage relative to HCV drugs that target other viral enzymes such as the protease, for which rapid development of resistance has proven to be an important cause of therapeutic failure.  

In a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend Sofosbuvir as first line therapy in combination with other antivirals for all six genotypes of Hepatitis C [L852]. Depending on the genotype, sofosbuvir is often used in combination with other antivirals such as [DB09027], [DB11613], [DB09102], [DB06290], [DB11574], [DB11575], [DB00811], [DB00008], or [DB00022] with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626]. Treatment with direct acting antivirals such as sofosbuvir is associated with very minimal side effects, with the most common being headache and fatigue [FDA Label]. Lack of significant side effects and short duration of therapy is a considerable advantage over older interferon- and ribavirin-based regimens, which were limited by infusion site reactions, reduced blood count, and neuropsychiatric effects [A19635]. 

Since 2014, sofosbuvir has been available as a fixed dose combination product with [DB09027] (tradename Harvoni) used for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C. Approved in October 2014 by the FDA, Harvoni is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1, 4, 5, and 6 with or without [DB00811] depending on the level of liver damage or cirrhosis [FDA Label].  When combined together, ledipasvir and sofosbuvir as the combination product Harvoni has been shown to achieve a SVR between 93 and 99% after 12 weeks of treatment [A7535]. Its use has also proven successful in the treatment of HCV in patients co-infected with HIV [A19627].

Sofosbuvir is also available as a fixed dose combination product with [DB11613] as the commercially available product Epclusa. First approved in June 2016, Epclusa is the first combination HCV product indicated for the treatment of all genotypes of Hepatitis C with or without cirrhosis. Epclusa is also currently the most potent HCV antiviral medication on the market with a sustained virologic response (SVR) after 12 weeks of therapy of 93-99% depending on genotype and level of cirrhosis [L852]. Both Canadian and American guidelines list Epclusa as a first line recommendation for all genotypes of HCV [L852, A19626].

Notably, sofosbuvir has come under intense scrutiny since its release to market in 2013. With the price per pill set at $1000, a 12-week treatment can cost upwards of $84,000 per patient [A19636].','["J05AP08", "J05AP51", "J05AP55", "J05AP56"]','[]'),(20435,'Heterosofir plus 90/400mg 28 tablets','هيتيروسوفير بلس 90/400مجم 28 قرص','1,100','','Hepatitis c treatment','Ledipasvir+sofosbuvir','Pharmed healthcare','Tablet','أقراص','400mg','1','علاج التهاب الكبد الفيروسي سي','indications and usage: it is a hepatitis c virus (hcv) nucleotide analog ns5b polymerase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c (chc) infection as a component of a combination antiviral treatment regimen. *efficacy has been establish','','',1256,'2022-05-28',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(20436,'Hexa diet 30 sachets','هيكسا دايت 30 كيس','200','','Weight loss','Psyllium husk powder+green tea+green coffee ext.+lemon+chromium picolinate+pineapple flavor','Medcare > hexa pharma','Sachet','أكياس','','1','يعمل على تقليل الوزن وزيادة حرق الدهون','','','',1262,'2022-05-12',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(20437,'Hexa oil topical spray 100 ml','هيكسا اويل سبراي بخاخ موضعي 100 مل','95','69.95','Massage','Peppermint oil+olive oil+clove oil+menthol+camphor+isopropyl alcohol','Egyptian company for cosmetics > pearla pharm co.','Spray','بخاخ','100 ml','1','باسط للعضلات','for rapid relief of painful muscle spasm and sprains','','',2243,'2023-12-23',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(20438,'Hexa-core lotion 120 ml','هيكسا-كور لوشن 120 مل','50','35','Soothing topical','Zinc oxide+panthenol','Hi-care > pharma zone','Lotion','لوشن','120 ml','1','ملطف موضعي للجلد','skin soothing lotion ... used for: diaper rash after sunlight exposure & sunburns','','',1319,'2024-02-17',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(20439,'Hexal vag. douche 200 ml','هيكسال غسول مهبلي 200 مل','95','70','Vaginal wash','','Leader cosmetics > purex health care','Unknown','غير محدد','200 ml','1','','indications ï- bacterial vaginosis. ï- fungal vulvovaginitis. ï- chlamydial infection. mode of action o potent anti fungal & anti bacterial action. o unique buffer system. o anti-inflammatory and demulcent effect. composition chlorhexidine hexamidine thym','6224001085109','',1046,'2024-01-31',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(20440,'Hexaxim i.m. prefilled syringe 0.5 ml','هيكسازيم حقنة مملوءة مسبقا 0.5 مل','1,136','794.5','Vaccine','Diphtheria+tetanus+pertussis+hepatitis b+poliomyelitis+haemophilus influenzae type b','Sanofi pastuer > sanofi','Syringe','حقنة','0.5 ml','1','','hexaxim (dtpa-hepb-ipv-hib) is a vaccine used to protect against infectious diseases. hexaxim helps to protect against diphtheria tetanus pertussis hepatitis b poliomyelitis and serious diseases caused by haemophilus influenzae type b. hexaxim can be give','','',2563,'2025-07-23',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(20441,'Aaa','ششش','120','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','0','','','','',681,'2022-08-14',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(20442,'Hexgabalin 75 mg 30 caps.','هيكسجابالين 75 مجم 30 كبسولة','111','','Anti-epileptic.gaba analogs','Pregabalin','Global napi pharmaceuticals','Cap','كبسولة','75 mg','3','','about pregabalin a gaba agonist anticonvulsant. mechanism of action of pregabalin pregabalin is a gaba neurotransmitter analog. it produces its action by modulating calcium channels and also reduces the release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate norep','6223002145195','',928,'2022-08-14',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Pregabalin is structurally similar to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) -

One of the most common uses for this drug is for a condition called _allergic rhinitis_. The prevalence of allergic rhinitis in the United States is about 15% according to physician diagnoses, and up to 30%, according to self-reported nasal symptoms. Allergic rhinitis is associated with multiple missed or unproductive days at work and school, problems with sleep, and other difficulties with day to day activities for many individuals [A175057]. Furthermore, some antihistamine agents that are used to treat this condition cause undesirable, sedating effects [A175060].

Both the endogenous form of vitamin D (that results from 7-dehydrocholesterol transformation), vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), and the plant-derived form, vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol), are considered the main forms of vitamin d and are found in various types of food for daily intake [L5689]. Structurally, ergocalciferol differs from cholecalciferol in that it possesses a double bond between C22 and C23 and has an additional methyl group at C24 [L5689]. Finally, ergocalciferol is pharmacologically less potent than cholecalciferol, which makes vitamin D3 the preferred agent for medical use [L5689].

Appropriate levels of vitamin D must be upheld in the body in order to maintain calcium and phosphorus levels in a healthy physiologic range to sustain a variety of metabolic functions, transcription regulation, and bone metabolism [A223, L5689, L1782, L5771, F4027, F4042, F4048].

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as sofosbuvir. As a prodrug nucleotide analog, Sofosbuvir is metabolized into its active form as the antiviral agent 2''-deoxy-2''-α-fluoro-β-C-methyluridine-5''-triphosphate (also known as GS-461203), which acts as a defective substrate for NS5B (non-structural protein 5B) [synthesis]. NS5B, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is essential for the transcription of Hepatitis C viral RNA and for its high replicative rate and genetic diversity [A19594]. Sofosbuvir and other direct acting antivirals are therefore very potent options for the treatment of Hepatitis C, as they exhibit a high barrier to the development of resistance [A19593]. This is an important advantage relative to HCV drugs that target other viral enzymes such as the protease, for which rapid development of resistance has proven to be an important cause of therapeutic failure.  

In a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend Sofosbuvir as first line therapy in combination with other antivirals for all six genotypes of Hepatitis C [L852]. Depending on the genotype, sofosbuvir is often used in combination with other antivirals such as [DB09027], [DB11613], [DB09102], [DB06290], [DB11574], [DB11575], [DB00811], [DB00008], or [DB00022] with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626]. Treatment with direct acting antivirals such as sofosbuvir is associated with very minimal side effects, with the most common being headache and fatigue [FDA Label]. Lack of significant side effects and short duration of therapy is a considerable advantage over older interferon- and ribavirin-based regimens, which were limited by infusion site reactions, reduced blood count, and neuropsychiatric effects [A19635]. 

Since 2014, sofosbuvir has been available as a fixed dose combination product with [DB09027] (tradename Harvoni) used for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C. Approved in October 2014 by the FDA, Harvoni is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1, 4, 5, and 6 with or without [DB00811] depending on the level of liver damage or cirrhosis [FDA Label].  When combined together, ledipasvir and sofosbuvir as the combination product Harvoni has been shown to achieve a SVR between 93 and 99% after 12 weeks of treatment [A7535]. Its use has also proven successful in the treatment of HCV in patients co-infected with HIV [A19627].

Sofosbuvir is also available as a fixed dose combination product with [DB11613] as the commercially available product Epclusa. First approved in June 2016, Epclusa is the first combination HCV product indicated for the treatment of all genotypes of Hepatitis C with or without cirrhosis. Epclusa is also currently the most potent HCV antiviral medication on the market with a sustained virologic response (SVR) after 12 weeks of therapy of 93-99% depending on genotype and level of cirrhosis [L852]. Both Canadian and American guidelines list Epclusa as a first line recommendation for all genotypes of HCV [L852, A19626].

Notably, sofosbuvir has come under intense scrutiny since its release to market in 2013. With the price per pill set at $1000, a 12-week treatment can cost upwards of $84,000 per patient [A19636].','["J05AP08", "J05AP51", "J05AP55", "J05AP56"]','[]'),(20539,'Hormo-6 25mg 20 f.c.tab.','هورمو-6 25 مجم 20 قرص','24','','Androgen','Mesterolone','Delta pharma','Tab','أقراص','25mg','2','يحفز نمو الأعضاء الجنسية للذكر','about mesterolone a synthetic orally effective dihydrotestosterone derivative androgen. mechanism of action of mesterolone mesterolone is an orally active synthetic testosterone derivative. testosterone and it`s reduced form; dihydrotestosterone binds wit','','',1926,'2022-05-13',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'G03BB01',NULL),(20540,'Hormston 10 mg 20 tab.','هورمستون 10 مجم 20 قرص','47','','','Dydrogesterone','Cid > chemipharm','Tab','أقراص','10 mg','2','','about dydrogesterone it is in the class of progestogens. mechanism of action of dydrogesterone it is a progestin derivative exerts it`s action through nuclear progesterone receptors situated in female genital tract breast cns and pituitary. when the drug','6222006501204','',1147,'2022-12-05',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'G03DB01',NULL),(20541,'Horny goat weed 1000 mg 90 rapid release caps.

Insulin is prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus to mimic the activity of endogenously produced human insulin, a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism. Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Absorption of glucose into cells allows for its transformation into glycogen or fat for storage. Insulin also inhibits hepatic glucose production, enhances protein synthesis, and inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis among many other functions.

Insulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. As a result, people with T1D rely primarily on exogenous forms of insulin, such as insulin lispro, to lower glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is also used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), another form of diabetes mellitus that is a slowly progressing metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors that promote chronically elevated blood sugar levels. Without treatment or improvement in non-pharmacological measures such as diet and exercise to lower blood glucose, high blood sugar eventually cause cellular resistance to endogenous insulin, and in the long term, damage to pancreatic islet cells. Insulin is typically prescribed later in the course of T2D, after several oral medications such as [DB00331], [DB01120], or [DB01261] have been tried, and when sufficient damage has been caused to pancreatic cells that the body is no longer able to produce insulin on its own. 

Marketed as the brand name product Humalog, insulin lispro begins to exert its effects within 15 minutes of subcutaneous administration, while peak levels occur 30 to 90 minutes after administration. Due to its duration of action of around 5 hours, Humalog is considered "bolus insulin" as it provides high levels of insulin in a short period of time to mimic the release of endogenous insulin from the pancreas after meals. Bolus insulin is often combined with once daily, long-acting "basal insulin" such as [DB01307], [DB09564], or [DB00047] to provide low concentrations of background insulin that can keep blood sugar stable between meals or overnight. Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas'' production of endogenous insulin, with a goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia.

Insulin lispro is produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing a non-pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli and was the first commercially available insulin analog. Formerly called LYSPRO from the chemical nomenclature [LYS(B28), PRO(B29)], insulin lispro differs from human insulin in that the amino acid proline at position B28 is replaced by lysine and the lysine in position B29 is replaced by proline. These biochemical changes result in a reduced tendency for self-association resulting in dissolution to a dimer and then to a monomer that is absorbed more rapidly after subcutaneous injection compared to endogenous human insulin. 

Without an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst. If left untreated, the body starts to break down fat, instead of glucose, for energy which results in a build-up of ketone acids in the blood and a syndrome called ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. In the long term, elevated blood sugar levels increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetic neuropathy.','["A10AC04", "A10AB04", "A10AD04"]','[]');

Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Absorption of glucose into cells allows for its transformation into glycogen or fat for storage. Insulin also inhibits hepatic glucose production, enhances protein synthesis, and inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis among many other functions.

Insulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. As a result, people with T1D rely primarily on exogenous forms of insulin, such as insulin lispro, to lower glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is also used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), another form of diabetes mellitus that is a slowly progressing metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors that promote chronically elevated blood sugar levels. Without treatment or improvement in non-pharmacological measures such as diet and exercise to lower blood glucose, high blood sugar eventually cause cellular resistance to endogenous insulin, and in the long term, damage to pancreatic islet cells. Insulin is typically prescribed later in the course of T2D, after several oral medications such as [DB00331], [DB01120], or [DB01261] have been tried, and when sufficient damage has been caused to pancreatic cells that the body is no longer able to produce insulin on its own. 

Marketed as the brand name product Humalog, insulin lispro begins to exert its effects within 15 minutes of subcutaneous administration, while peak levels occur 30 to 90 minutes after administration. Due to its duration of action of around 5 hours, Humalog is considered "bolus insulin" as it provides high levels of insulin in a short period of time to mimic the release of endogenous insulin from the pancreas after meals. Bolus insulin is often combined with once daily, long-acting "basal insulin" such as [DB01307], [DB09564], or [DB00047] to provide low concentrations of background insulin that can keep blood sugar stable between meals or overnight. Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas'' production of endogenous insulin, with a goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia.

Insulin lispro is produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing a non-pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli and was the first commercially available insulin analog. Formerly called LYSPRO from the chemical nomenclature [LYS(B28), PRO(B29)], insulin lispro differs from human insulin in that the amino acid proline at position B28 is replaced by lysine and the lysine in position B29 is replaced by proline. These biochemical changes result in a reduced tendency for self-association resulting in dissolution to a dimer and then to a monomer that is absorbed more rapidly after subcutaneous injection compared to endogenous human insulin. 

Without an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst. If left untreated, the body starts to break down fat, instead of glucose, for energy which results in a build-up of ketone acids in the blood and a syndrome called ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. In the long term, elevated blood sugar levels increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetic neuropathy.','["A10AC04", "A10AB04", "A10AD04"]','[]'),(20553,'Humalog mix25 100i.u./ml (5 cartridges)','هومالوج ميكس 25/100 وحدة دولية/مل 5 خرطوشات','928','612','Anti-diabetic.insulin analouge','Insulin lispro+insulin lispro protamine','Eli lilly','Unknown','غير محدد','','5','','','','',1597,'2024-11-10',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'V03AB14',NULL),(20555,'Aaa','ششش','687','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',680,'2022-07-15',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(20559,'Human albumin octapharma 20% i.v.infusion (hospitals price)','البيومين بشري اوكتافارما 20% محلول وريدي  مستشفيات','545','','Human albumin','Human albumin','Octapharma > pharma over seas','Unknown','غير محدد','20%','1','','','','',1494,'2022-07-11',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'B05AA01',NULL),(20561,'Aaa','ششش','9','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',580,'2022-08-03',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(20562,'Human insulin mix vacsera-bioton 30/70 100i.u./ml vial','هيومان انسولين ميكس بيوتين 30/70 100وحدة/مل فيال','31','','Anti-diabetic.insulin analouge','Insulin neutral human+insulin isophane protamine human','Vacsera > bioton co. ltd-poland','Vial','فيال','','1','','indication indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults and children with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. mechanism of action the primary activity of insulin is the regulation of glucose metabolism. insulin promo','','',2616,'2022-07-09',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(20563,'Human insulin n vacsera-bioton 100i.u./ml vial','هيومان انسولين بشري ار فاكسيرا 100 وحدة/مل فيال','31','','Anti-diabetic.insulin analouge','Insulin isophane protamine human','Vacsera > bioton co. ltd-poland','Vial','فيال','','1','','about insulin isophane nph pancreatic hormone intermediate-acting insulin analogue antidiabetic agent. mechanism of action of insulin isophane nph it is an intermediate acting antihyperglycaemic drug. insulin acts through binding to a subunit of insulin r','','',1155,'2022-07-16',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(20564,'Human insulin r vacsera-bioton 100i.u./ml vial','هيومان انسولين بشري ار فاكسيرا 100 وحدة/مل فيال','31','','Anti-diabetic.insulin analouge','Insulin neutral human','Vacsera > bioton co. ltd-poland','Vial','فيال','','1','','indication indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults and children with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. mechanism of action the primary activity of insulin is the regulation of glucose metabolism. insulin promo','','',971,'2022-07-15',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'A10AB01',NULL),(20565,'Humira 40mg/0.4ml 2 prefilled syringes','هيوميرا 40مجم/0.4 مل 2 سرنجات معبأة للحقن','14,113','13600','Tnf-inhibitor','Adalimumab','Abbvie ltd. > multipharma','Syringe','حقنة','40mg','2','','','','',3441,'2024-11-05',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Adalimumab is a subcutaneously administered biological disease modifier for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other chronic debilitating diseases mediated by tumor necrosis factor.[A39984,A39999] It was originally launched by Abbvie in the U.S. and approved in 2002 by the FDA.[A39983] This drug is frequently known as _Humira_.

Thiazide-like diuretics such as indapamide are a valuable tool for the treatment of hypertension and continue to grow in popularity, falling behind only ACE inhibitors in terms of prescription frequency.[A204134] When compared to [hydrochlorothiazide] (another commonly prescribed diuretic), indapamide has been shown to be superior at lowering systolic blood pressure, reducing left ventricular mass index, lowering oxidative stress, inhibiting platelet aggregation, and reducing microalbuminuria associated with diabetes.[A204134] Interestingly, unlike thiazide diuretics, several sources suggest that indapamide is not associated with glucose or lipid disturbances.[A204134,A204161]

ARBs selectively bind to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) and prevent the protein angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects, which include vasoconstriction, stimulation and synthesis of aldosterone and ADH, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, among others. Overall, valsartan''s physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium. 

Valsartan also affects the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays an important role in hemostasis and regulation of kidney, vascular, and cardiac functions. Pharmacological blockade of RAAS via  AT1 receptor blockade inhibits negative regulatory feedback within RAAS, which is a contributing factor to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal disease. In particular, heart failure is associated with chronic activation of RAAS, leading to inappropriate fluid retention, vasoconstriction, and ultimately a further decline in left ventricular function. ARBs have been shown to have a protective effect on the heart by improving cardiac function, reducing afterload, increasing cardiac output and preventing ventricular hypertrophy and remodelling.[A174154] 

By comparison, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) class of medications (which includes drugs such as [ramipril], [lisinopril], and [perindopril]) inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II through inhibition of the ACE enzyme. However, this does not prevent the formation of all angiotensin II within the body. The angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs unique in that it blocks all angiotensin II activity, regardless of where or how it was synthesized. 

Valsartan is commonly used for the management of hypertension, heart failure, and Type 2 Diabetes-associated nephropathy, particularly in patients who are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors. ARBs such as valsartan have been shown in a number of large-scale clinical outcomes trials to improve cardiovascular outcomes including reducing risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, the progression of heart failure, and hospitalization.[A174124,A178153,A173869,A185324,A185327,A185333,A185342,A185345] Valsartan also slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy due to its renoprotective effects.[A174157,A174160,A174163] Improvements in chronic kidney disease with valsartan include both clinically and statistically significant decreases in urinary albumin and protein excretion in patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and in nondiabetic patients diagnosed with chronic kidney disease.[A174124,A173869]

Valsartan was initially approved in 1996 in Europe for the treatment of hypertension in adults. Shortly after, in 1997, this drug was approved in the United States.[A174124] Valsartan is generally well-tolerated with a side-effect profile superior to that of other antihypertensive drugs.[A174130,A174133]','["C09DX05", "C10BX10", "C09DA03", "C09CA03", "C09DX02", "C09DX01", "C09DB08", "C09DB01", "C09DX04"]','[]'),(20709,'Idixor 37.5mg 7 tab.','ايديكسور 37.5مجم 7 اقراص','27','','Psychiatric.antidepressants','Venlafaxine','International drug agency (idi) > novell pharma','Tab','أقراص','37.5mg','1','','','6221051810705','',760,'2023-01-13',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Venlafaxine is an antidepressant and a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI).

By inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol within the liver, statins lower abnormal cholesterol and lipid levels and ultimately reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid. This is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Pitavastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] Increasing use of the statin class of drugs is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, [rosuvastatin] is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg [rosuvastatin] per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels.[A181409,A181535,A181538,A1793] Study data has confirmed that pitavastatin''s potency in lowering LDL-C is comparable to that of other statins but also has increased efficacy in increasing HDL-C (also known as "good cholesterol").[A182000,A182003,A182006] Despite these differences in potency, several trials have demonstrated only minimal differences in terms of clinical outcomes between statins.[A181538, A181427]','["C10AA08"]','[]'),(21114,'Jackwell 2 mg 30 f.c. tabs.','جاكويل 2 مجم 30 قرص','78','','Antihyperlipidemic.statins','Pitavastatin','Hochster pharmaceutical industries','Tab','أقراص','2 mg','3','','pitavastatin is used for: lowering high cholesterol and triglycerides in certain patients. it also increases high-density lipoprotein (hdl good) cholesterol levels. it is used along with an appropriate diet. usual adult dose for hyperlipidemia or dyslipid','','',702,'2022-07-15',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Pitavastatin, also known as the brand name product Livalo, is a lipid-lowering drug belonging to the statin class of medications.

Pitavastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] Increasing use of the statin class of drugs is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, [rosuvastatin] is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg [rosuvastatin] per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels.[A181409,A181535,A181538,A1793] Study data has confirmed that pitavastatin''s potency in lowering LDL-C is comparable to that of other statins but also has increased efficacy in increasing HDL-C (also known as "good cholesterol").[A182000,A182003,A182006] Despite these differences in potency, several trials have demonstrated only minimal differences in terms of clinical outcomes between statins.[A181538, A181427]','["C10AA08"]','[]');
