    "clinical_significance": "During preconception counseling, the clinician should perform a risk assessment, which includes reviewing a thorough history of medical, surgical, psychosocial, genetic, nutritional, and behavioral risks (including screening for alcohol and drug use); appropriate risk-reducing interventions should then be advised. Additionally, education on environmental toxins can be provided, appropriate immunizations recommended, and genetic screening offered. The overall goal is preconception wellness and optimal management of chronic health conditions and behavioral issues. Early preconception counseling and intervention have the potential to significantly reduce perinatal morbidity and mortality, which is the fundamental goal of all obstetric care.\n[17]"
