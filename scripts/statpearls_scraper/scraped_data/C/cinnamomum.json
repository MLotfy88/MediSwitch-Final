    "clinical_significance": "Western blotting comprises multiple sequential steps, each contributing to the accuracy of the final outcome. The complexity of this process increases both the time and cost required for reliable results. Compared with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blotting exhibits lower susceptibility to false-positive findings, particularly in the serologic diagnosis of HIV infection.\n[41]\n\nWestern blotting is widely employed for detecting anti-HIV antibodies in human serum and urine samples.\n[42]\nProtein extracts from confirmed HIV-positive individuals are separated by electrophoresis and subsequently transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Specific antibodies are then applied to identify viral proteins on the membrane surface.\n[43]\nWestern blotting is typically performed following an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to confirm serologic results and provides greater analytical sensitivity.\n[44]\nIn modern commercial HIV Western blot kits, viral proteins are preaffixed to the membrane. When patient serum or urine samples are introduced, antibodies bind to these immobilized proteins, and anti-human immunoglobulin antibodies detect the resulting bands alongside quality control markers.\n[45]\n\nWestern blotting is also applied in the diagnostic evaluation of Lyme disease. The method is likewise used to identify both atypical and classical forms of bovine spongiform encephalopathy.\n[46]\n[47]\n\nThe Western blot technique determines the presence, molecular weight, and relative abundance of target proteins within a sample, providing valuable analytical data across numerous fields of research.\n[48]\nThis test is widely employed to study protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions, posttranslational modifications, protein isoforms, antibody specificity, epitope mapping, and subcellular protein localization.\n\nAs an antibody-based analytical method, Western blotting enables high-throughput detection of proteins involved in noninfectious diseases with high reliability. In oncology, aberrant protein isoforms may serve as potential biomarkers of malignancy, while the detection of autoantibodies can indicate autoimmune pathologies.\n[49]\n\nIn molecular biology, proteins are often engineered through cloning techniques to include short amino acid sequences that act as epitope tags, such as the HA-tag derived from hemagglutinin and the Myc-tag containing the c-Myc protein. These tags represent foreign epitopes not naturally expressed in the studied system, facilitating the detection and quantification of the tagged protein amid native proteins.\n[50]\nAntibodies specific to these tags identify both the presence and relative abundance of the engineered protein in Western blot analysis."
