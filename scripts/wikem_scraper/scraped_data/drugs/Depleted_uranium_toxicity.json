    "Background": {
      "text": "Uranium is an alpha-emitting, radioactive heavy metal that occurs naturally in nearly all rocks and soil. Natural uranium is made up of the three naturally occurring isotopes of uranium namely\n234\nU,\n235\nU, and\n238\nU. Naturally occurring uranium deposits are over 99%\n238\nU. You eat, drink, and breather natural uranium on a daily basis.\nHealth hazards of natural uranium have been studied extensively since 1940s. Health impact of Depleted Uranium (DU) has been studied since the early 1970s.\nEnrichment is the industrial process by which natural uranium is separated into enriched uranium which has an increased percentage of\n235\nU and depleted uranium which has a decreased percentage of\n235\nU.\nDU is a byproduct of the enrichment process.\nDU has 40% less radioactivity than natural uranium. It has a specific activity of 0.33 microCi/g.\nDU has the same chemical properties as naturally occurring uranium, it simply has different ratio of isotopes of\n234\nU,\n235\nU, and\n238\nU.\nDU health effects will be the same as for natural uranium because the toxicity is primarily due to the chemical toxicity rather than radiotoxicity.\nUnited States Armed Forces have used depleted uranium in the manufacture of ammunition, armor, and aircraft.\nDU's high density, self-sharpening quality and pyrophoricity make it a good choice for projectile munitions.\nDU's density makes it a good armor choice.\nDU's density also makes it a good choice for counterbalance weights used in aircraft and on helicopter rotors.",
