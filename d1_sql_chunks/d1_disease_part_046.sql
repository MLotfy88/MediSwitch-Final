Monitoring respiratory function during dosage initiation and adjustment is recommended.  Use of atropine along with discontinuation of the cholinesterase inhibitor may be required for serious respiratory distress.  Neostigmine may produce more severe muscarinic side effects than does pyridostigmine and ambenonium.  However, the duration of action is longest for ambenonium and shortest for edrophonium.  Echothiophate iodide ophthalmic may be systemically absorbed and cautious use is recommended in these patients.', '3', 'Wilcock GK, Surmon D, Forsyth D, Morgan R "Cholinergic side-effects of tetrahydroaminoacridine."
