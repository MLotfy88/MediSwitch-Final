Zalcitabine-related peripheral neuropathy is a sensorimotor neuropathy characterized initially by numbness and burning dysesthesia involving the distal extremities. These symptoms may be followed by sharp shooting pains or severe continuous burning pain if the drug is not withdrawn, and progress to severe pain requiring narcotic analgesics. The neuropathy is potentially irreversible.

Otherwise, careful monitoring is recommended for symptoms of neuropathy such as burning, tingling, pain, numbness, or weakness in the extremities, particularly in patients with a low CD4 cell count or diabetes. Since the development of peripheral neuropathy appears to be dose-related, the recommended dosage of zalcitabine should not be exceeded. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue zalcitabine therapy and contact their physician if neuropathy develops. Therapy may be reinstituted following resolution of neuropathy symptoms, but dosage should be reduced to one-half the initially recommended dosage.
