Oseltamivir exerts its antiviral activity by inhibiting the activity of the viral neuraminidase enzyme found on the surface of the virus, which prevents budding from the host cell, viral replication, and infectivity.

The clinical benefit of use of oseltamivir is greatest when administered within 48 hours of the onset of influenza symptoms since effectiveness decreases significantly after that point in time; there is generally no benefit in use beyond 48 hours for healthy, low-risk individuals as influenza is a self-limiting illness.[A180574, L7267, A180580] However, antiviral treatment might be beneficial when initiated after 48 hours for patients with severe, complicated or progressive illness or for hospitalized patients.[A180583] According to the CDC, data from clinical trials and observational studies have demonstrated that early antiviral treatment can shorten the duration of fever and illness symptoms, and may reduce the risk of some complications (including pneumonia and respiratory failure). They recommend the use of oseltamivir in people with a higher risk of developing complications including children younger than 2 years, people over 65 years, people with some chronic conditions or immunosuppression, pregnant women, residents of long term care facilities, and indigenous communities for example.[L7264]

The benefits of oseltamivir use are controversial; a 2014 Cochrane Review of the evidence found that oseltamivir treatment had limited benefit. The authors concluded that oseltamivir use in healthy adults had small, non-specific effects on symptoms (where the time to first alleviation of symptoms was only reduced from 7 to 6.3 days), it had no effect on hospitalizations, and that there was no evidence for any reductions in complications of influenza such as pneumonia.[A179962, A179965, A179968] Due to the risk of adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, psychiatric effects and renal adverse events in adults and vomiting in children, the harms are generally considered to outweigh the small clinical benefit of use of oseltamivir. 

Notably, in 2017, the World Health Organization downgraded oseltamivir from its essential medicines list from a "core" drug to a "complementary" drug, due to limited cost-effectiveness.[A179086] Yearly vaccination with the influenza vaccine is still considered the best preventative measure.','["J05AH02"]','[]'),(18434,'Aaa','ششش','88','67','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',853,'2023-08-19',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(18435,'Epinephrine-memphis 1 mg/ml 5 i.m./s.c. amp.','ابينفرين ممفيس 1مجم /مل 5 امبولات','10','','Alpha and beta adrenergic agonist','Adrenaline','Memphis','Amp','أمبول','1 mg','5','علاج حالات الحساسية المفرطة','about adrenaline alpha and beta adrenergic agonist catecholamine vasoconstrictor. anti asthma inanaphylatic shock. mechanism of action of adrenaline adrenaline is an alpha and beta adrenergic agonist which exerts it`s therapeutic actions through predomina','','',1228,'2023-05-04',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(18436,'Epinephrine-misr 1 mg/ml 100 amp.','ابينفرين - مصر 1مجم/مل 100 امبولة','750','600','Alpha and beta adrenergic agonist','Adrenaline','Misr','Amp','أمبول','1 mg','100','','about adrenaline alpha and beta adrenergic agonist catecholamine vasoconstrictor. anti asthma inanaphylatic shock. mechanism of action of adrenaline adrenaline is an alpha and beta adrenergic agonist which exerts it`s therapeutic actions through predomina','','',1484,'2024-12-24',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(18438,'Epinos fruit 6 eff. salt sachet','ايبينوس فواكه 6 اكياس فوار','4','','Antacid','Citric acid+sodium bicarbonte+tartaric acid','Eipico','Sachet','أكياس','','1','','interactions: antacids concurrent use of antacids with citrates may result in systemic alkalosis. concomitant administration of antacids with sodium citrate and sodium bicarbonate may promote the development of calcium stones in patients with uric acid st','','',1010,'2022-07-12',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(18439,'Epinos pineapple 6 eff. salt 6sachet','ابينوس اناناس 6 اكياس فوار','4','','Antacid','Citric acid+sodium bicarbonte+tartaric acid','Eipico','Sachet','أكياس','','1','','interactions: antacids concurrent use of antacids with citrates may result in systemic alkalosis. concomitant administration of antacids with sodium citrate and sodium bicarbonate may promote the development of calcium stones in patients with uric acid st','','',808,'2022-07-18',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(18440,'Epinos pineapple 60 eff. salt sachet','ابينوس اناناس 60 اكياس فوار','18','','Antacid','Citric acid+sodium bicarbonte+tartaric acid','Eipico','Sachet','أكياس','','1','','interactions: antacids concurrent use of antacids with citrates may result in systemic alkalosis. concomitant administration of antacids with sodium citrate and sodium bicarbonate may promote the development of calcium stones in patients with uric acid st','','',1066,'2022-07-09',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(18442,'Epiphenicol 1% eye oint. 5 gm','ابيفينيكول 1% مرهم للعين 5 جم','7','','Antibiotic','Chloramphenicol','Eipico','Oint','مرهم','1%','1','','description an antibiotic first isolated from cultures of streptomyces venequelae in 1947 but now produced synthetically. it has a relatively simple structure and was the first broad-spectrum antibiotic to be discovered. it acts by interfering with bacter','','',919,'2022-07-30',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'An antibiotic first isolated from cultures of _Streptomyces venequelae_ in 1947 but now produced synthetically.

More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Rosuvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [simvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] This is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than [atorvastatin]''s effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial[A181427] concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.

Rosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]','["C10BX10", "C10BX05", "C10BX07", "C10AA07", "A10BH52", "G01AE10", "C10BX13", "C10BX09", "C10BA09", "C10BX16", "C10BX17", "C10BX14", "C10BA06"]','[]'),(18452,'Epirovastin 20 mg 14 f.c. tab','ابيروفاستين 20مجم 14 قرص','76','28.5','Antihyperlipidemic.statins','Rosuvastatin','Eipico','Tab','أقراص','20 mg','2','دواء خافض لدهون الدم','about rosuvastatin statin hmg-coa reductase inhibitor antilipemic. mechanism of action of rosuvastatin it is a hypolipidaemic statin which competitively inhibits the conversion of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme a (hmg coa) to mevalonate. the drug ex','6221032107664','',3556,'2024-11-13',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Rosuvastatin, also known as the brand name product Crestor, is a lipid-lowering drug that belongs to the statin class of medications, which are used to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and manage elevated lipid levels by inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes.

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as sofosbuvir. As a prodrug nucleotide analog, Sofosbuvir is metabolized into its active form as the antiviral agent 2''-deoxy-2''-α-fluoro-β-C-methyluridine-5''-triphosphate (also known as GS-461203), which acts as a defective substrate for NS5B (non-structural protein 5B) [synthesis]. NS5B, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is essential for the transcription of Hepatitis C viral RNA and for its high replicative rate and genetic diversity [A19594]. Sofosbuvir and other direct acting antivirals are therefore very potent options for the treatment of Hepatitis C, as they exhibit a high barrier to the development of resistance [A19593]. This is an important advantage relative to HCV drugs that target other viral enzymes such as the protease, for which rapid development of resistance has proven to be an important cause of therapeutic failure.  

In a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend Sofosbuvir as first line therapy in combination with other antivirals for all six genotypes of Hepatitis C [L852]. Depending on the genotype, sofosbuvir is often used in combination with other antivirals such as [DB09027], [DB11613], [DB09102], [DB06290], [DB11574], [DB11575], [DB00811], [DB00008], or [DB00022] with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626]. Treatment with direct acting antivirals such as sofosbuvir is associated with very minimal side effects, with the most common being headache and fatigue [FDA Label]. Lack of significant side effects and short duration of therapy is a considerable advantage over older interferon- and ribavirin-based regimens, which were limited by infusion site reactions, reduced blood count, and neuropsychiatric effects [A19635]. 

Since 2014, sofosbuvir has been available as a fixed dose combination product with [DB09027] (tradename Harvoni) used for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C. Approved in October 2014 by the FDA, Harvoni is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1, 4, 5, and 6 with or without [DB00811] depending on the level of liver damage or cirrhosis [FDA Label].  When combined together, ledipasvir and sofosbuvir as the combination product Harvoni has been shown to achieve a SVR between 93 and 99% after 12 weeks of treatment [A7535]. Its use has also proven successful in the treatment of HCV in patients co-infected with HIV [A19627].

Sofosbuvir is also available as a fixed dose combination product with [DB11613] as the commercially available product Epclusa. First approved in June 2016, Epclusa is the first combination HCV product indicated for the treatment of all genotypes of Hepatitis C with or without cirrhosis. Epclusa is also currently the most potent HCV antiviral medication on the market with a sustained virologic response (SVR) after 12 weeks of therapy of 93-99% depending on genotype and level of cirrhosis [L852]. Both Canadian and American guidelines list Epclusa as a first line recommendation for all genotypes of HCV [L852, A19626].

Notably, sofosbuvir has come under intense scrutiny since its release to market in 2013. With the price per pill set at $1000, a 12-week treatment can cost upwards of $84,000 per patient [A19636].','["J05AP08", "J05AP51", "J05AP55", "J05AP56"]','[]'),(18463,'Aaa','ششش','10','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',762,'2022-05-26',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(18464,'Epistigmin 2.5mg/ml vial','ابيستجمين 2.5مجم/مل فيال','42','18','Para-sympathomimetic','Neostigmine','Eipico','Vial','فيال','2.5mg','1','علاج الوهن العضلي','','6221032316615','',1076,'2024-11-27',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'A cholinesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of myasthenia gravis and to reverse the effects of muscle relaxants such as gallamine and tubocurarine.

It is primarily used for the treatment of respiratory, enteric and genitourinary infections and may be used instead of other macrolides for some sexually transmitted and enteric infections. It is structurally related to erythromycin [A174169].

Azithromycin [9-deoxo-9a-aza-9a-methyl-9a-homoerythromycin] is a part of the _azalide_ subclass of macrolides, and contains a 15-membered ring, with a methyl-substituted nitrogen instead of a carbonyl group at the 9a position on the aglycone ring, which allows for the prevention of its metabolism. This differentiates azithromycin from other types of macrolides [A174175].

In March 2020, a small study was funded by the French government to investigate the treatment of COVID-19 with a combination of azithromycin and the anti-malaria drug [hydroxychloroquine].

Finally, ergocalciferol is pharmacologically less potent than cholecalciferol, which makes vitamin D3 the preferred agent for medical use [L5689].

Appropriate levels of vitamin D must be upheld in the body in order to maintain calcium and phosphorus levels in a healthy physiologic range to sustain a variety of metabolic functions, transcription regulation, and bone metabolism [A223, L5689, L1782, L5771, F4027, F4042, F4048].

Olmesartan also affects the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays an important role in hemostasis and regulation of kidney, vascular, and cardiac functions. Pharmacological blockade of RAAS via  AT1 receptor blockade inhibits negative regulatory feedback within RAAS, which is a contributing factor to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal disease. In particular, heart failure is associated with chronic activation of RAAS, leading to inappropriate fluid retention, vasoconstriction, and ultimately a further decline in left ventricular function.

The result of doing so allows cGMP present in both the penis and pulmonary vasculature to elicit smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation that subsequently facilitates relief in pulmonary arterial hypertension and the increased flow of blood into the spongy erectile tissue of the penis that consequently allows it to grow in size and become erect and rigid [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

Interestingly enough, it is precisely via this mechanism why sildenafil was at first researched as a potential treatment for angina - or chest pain associated with inadequate blood flow to the heart - before being serendipitously indicated for treating erectile dysfunction in the late 1980s [A175732]. Nevertheless, it is because of this mechanism that sildenafil is also indicated for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension but is also additionally notorious for interacting with various anti-anginal or anti-hypertensive agents to develop potentially rapid, excessive, and/or fatal hypotensive crises [A175579, A175582, A175654].

Regardless, sildenafil, among a variety of other similar or related PDE5 inhibitors, has become a common and effective treatment for erectile dysfunction and since its formal approval for medical use in the public in 1998 [A175732], continues to see millions of prescriptions written for it internationally. Although the medication has historically been most popularly recognized as Pfizer''s brand name Viagra, sildenafil is currently available generically and even as a non-prescription over the counter medication in some countries [L5656].','["G01AE10", "G04BE03"]','[]'),(18514,'Erecanova 10 mg 4 disinteg. tabs','اريكانوفا 10مجم 4 اقراص سريعة الذوبان','40','31','Tonic for men','Vardenafil','Atco pharma > atm pharmaceutical industries','Tab','أقراص','10 mg','1','مقوي للرجال','','6223002977345','',21793,'2023-10-06',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Vardenafil (Levitra) is an oral therapy for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. It is a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). Penile erection is a hemodynamic process initiated by the relaxation of smooth muscle in the corpus cavernosum and its associated arterioles. During sexual stimulation, nitric oxide is released from nerve endings and endothelial cells in the corpus cavernosum. Nitric oxide activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase resulting in increased synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the smooth muscle cells of the corpus cavernosum. The cGMP in turn triggers smooth muscle relaxation, allowing increased blood flow into the penis, resulting in erection. The tissue concentration of cGMP is regulated by both the rates of synthesis and degradation via phosphodiesterases (PDEs). The most abundant PDE in the human corpus cavernosum is the cGMPspecific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5); therefore, the inhibition of PDE5 enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP.','["G04BE09"]','[]'),(18515,'Erectalis 20 mg 4 f.c. tab','اريكتاليس 20مجم 4 قرص','148','100','Tonic for men','Tadalafil','Penta pharma-egypt','Tab','أقراص','20 mg','4','مقوي للرجال','','6224007738191','',2569,'2025-06-03',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Tadalafil is a selective phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor that is used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and benign prostatic hypertrophy.[L39100, L39105] It was first approved in 2003 by the FDA for use in ED and later in 2009 for PAH.

Exerting an antitumor action, apalutamide blocking the effect of androgens that promote tumor growth. It targets the AR ligand-binding domain and prevents AR nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and transcription of AR gene targets in prostate tumors [A31846]. In mice bearing human CRPC xenograft models, apalutamide treatment produced tumor regressions in a dose-dependent manner that was more effective than that of [DB01128] or [DB08899]. Unlike bicalutamide, apalutamide antagonized AR-mediated signaling in AR overexpressing human CRPC cell lines [A31846].

Androgen-deprivation therapy, or hormone therapy, can be used as part of maintenance therapy for patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer. Although most patients achieve therapeutic responses at the initial hormone therapy, many patients progress to non-metastatic castration-resistant (resistance to hormone therapy) prostate cancer which is the second-most common cause of cancer-related deaths in American males [A31852]. Castration-resistant prostate cancer is often incurable, which poses significant clinical challenges for patients. Approximately 10 to 20 % of prostate cancer cases are castration-resistant, and up to 16% of these patients show no evidence of cancer metastasis at the time of castration-resistant diagnosis [L1295]. Higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and shorter PSA doubling time (PSA DT) are associated with a higher risk for metastases and death [A31846]. In a phase-2 multicenter open-label study, 89% of patients with non-metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer had ≥50% PSA decline at week 12 of apalutamide treatment [A31846]. In a randomized trial, the median metastasis-free survival for patients taking apalutamide was 40.5 months compared to 16.2 months for patients taking a placebo [L1295]. Apalutamide displayed good tolerability and safety profile in clinical studies.

Esomeprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells.

More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Rosuvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [simvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] This is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than [atorvastatin]''s effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial[A181427] concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.

Rosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]','["C10BX10", "C10BX05", "C10BX07", "C10AA07", "A10BH52", "G01AE10", "C10BX13", "C10BX09", "C10BA09", "C10BX16", "C10BX17", "C10BX14", "C10BA06"]','[]'),(18583,'Estero-map 20mg 30 f.c. tab','استيرو-ماب 20مجم 30 قرص','141','105','Antihyperlipidemic.statins','Rosuvastatin','Multi-apex','Tab','أقراص','20mg','3','','','6223003207823','',1140,'2024-09-02',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Rosuvastatin, also known as the brand name product Crestor, is a lipid-lowering drug that belongs to the statin class of medications, which are used to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and manage elevated lipid levels by inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver.

Rosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]','["C10BX10", "C10BX05", "C10BX07", "C10AA07", "A10BH52", "G01AE10", "C10BX13", "C10BX09", "C10BA09", "C10BX16", "C10BX17", "C10BX14", "C10BA06"]','[]'),(18584,'Estikana 10mg 28 f.c.tab.','استيكانا 10مجم 28 قرص','132','60','Psychiatric.antidepressants','Escitalopram','Hochster pharmaceutical industries','Tab','أقراص','10mg','2','مضاد للاكتئاب','','','',939,'2024-10-28',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Escitalopram is a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) and the S-enantiomer of racemic [citalopram].[A185420] It is used to restore serotonergic function in the treatment of depression and anxiety.[L8513,L8516,L8522] Escitalopram is approximately 150 times more potent than citalopram’s R-enantiomer and is responsible for the vast majority of citalopram’s clinical activity, with some evidence suggesting that the R-enantiomer of racemic citalopram actively dampens the activity of escitalopram rather than existing simply as an inactive enantiomer.[A39738,A185819] Amongst SSRIs, escitalopram exerts the highest degree of selectivity for the serotonin transporter (SERT) relative to other off-targets which may explain its lower rates of adverse effects as compared to other agents in this class.[A185726] Escitalopram also differentiates itself from other SSRIs via allosteric action on its target - this may be the mechanism responsible for its observed superior efficacy and faster onset compared to other SSRIs.[A185825,A185726,A185822]','["N06AB10"]','[]'),(18585,'Estikana 10 mg 14 f.c. tab','استيكانا 10مجم 14 قرص','48','34','Psychiatric.antidepressants','Escitalopram','Hochster pharmaceutical industries','Tab','أقراص','10 mg','1','مضاد للاكتئاب والامراض النفسية','','6221000000539','',5478,'2024-11-11',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Escitalopram is a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) and the S-enantiomer of racemic [citalopram].[A185420] It is used to restore serotonergic function in the treatment of depression and anxiety.[L8513,L8516,L8522] Escitalopram is approximately 150 times more potent than citalopram’s R-enantiomer and is responsible for the vast majority of citalopram’s clinical activity, with some evidence suggesting that the R-enantiomer of racemic citalopram actively dampens the activity of escitalopram rather than existing simply as an inactive enantiomer.[A39738,A185819] Amongst SSRIs, escitalopram exerts the highest degree of selectivity for the serotonin transporter (SERT) relative to other off-targets which may explain its lower rates of adverse effects as compared to other agents in this class.[A185726] Escitalopram also differentiates itself from other SSRIs via allosteric action on its target - this may be the mechanism responsible for its observed superior efficacy and faster onset compared to other SSRIs.[A185825,A185726,A185822]','["N06AB10"]','[]'),(18586,'Estohalt 10 mg 14 caps.','استوهالت 10 مجم 14 كبسولة','17','','Peptic ulcer.proton pump inhibitor','Omeprazole','Amriya','Cap','كبسولة','10 mg','1','','about omeprazole proton pump inhibitor substituted benzimidazole anti-secretory antiulcer. mechanism of action of omeprazole omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor and it is a prodrug. after administration it diffuses in to the parietal cell of the stomach','6221075021521','',831,'2022-07-29',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Originally approved by the FDA in 1989, omeprazole is a _proton-pump inhibitor_, used to treat gastric acid-related disorders.

This higher proportion of T3 in desiccated thyroid products can lead to supraphysiologic levels of T3 which may put patients at risk of thyrotoxicosis if thyroid extract therapy is not adjusted according to the serum TSH.[A35722, F4636]','["H03AA01"]','[]'),(18660,'Aaa','ششش','23','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','0','','','','',800,'2022-10-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(18661,'Euvax-b 20mcg/ml i.m (0.5ml) vial','ايفاكس-بي 20 ميكروجرام/مل (0.5مل) فيال','8','','Vaccine','Vaccine hepatitis b','Lg life science ltd -korea > egycopharm','Vial','فيال','20mcg','1','','','','',918,'2022-07-22',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(18662,'Euvax-b 20mcg/ml i.m (10ml) vial','ايفاكس-بي 20 ميكروجرام/مل (10مل) فيال','74','','Vaccine','Vaccine hepatitis b','Lg life science ltd -korea > egycopharm','Vial','فيال','20mcg','1','','','','',856,'2022-07-13',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(18663,'Euvax-b 20mcg/ml i.m (1ml) vial','ايفاكس-بي 20 ميكروجرام/مل (1مل) فيال','15','','Vaccine','Vaccine hepatitis b','Lg life science ltd -korea > egycopharm','Vial','فيال','20mcg','1','','','','',842,'2022-07-18',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(18664,'Euvax-b 20mcg/ml i.m (5ml) vial','ايفاكس-بي 20 ميكروجرام/مل (5مل) فيال','37','','Vaccine','Vaccine hepatitis b','Lg life science ltd -korea > egycopharm','Vial','فيال','20mcg','1','','','','',890,'2022-07-13',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(18666,'Aaa','ششش','10','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',712,'2022-12-05',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(18667,'Aaa','ششش','36','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','0','','','','',681,'2022-10-16',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(18668,'Evastine 10mg 20 f.c.tab.','ايفاستين 10مجم 20 قرص','54','36','Antihistamine.antiallergy','Ebastine','Marcyrl co.','Tab','أقراص','10mg','2','','about ebastine second generation long-acting and selective h1 antagonist non-sedative antihistamine. mechanism of action of ebastine drug and its active metabolite is selective peripheral histamine h1 receptor antagonist. thus it prevents the attachment o','6223003570248','',5283,'2024-07-30',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'R06AX22',NULL),(18669,'Aaa','ششش','14','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','0','','','','',673,'2023-01-05',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(18670,'Evening primrose oil 1000 mg 120 softgels (illegal import)','زيت زهرة الربيع المسائية 1000 مجم 120 كبسولة','0','','Evening primrose oil','Evening primrose oil+cis-linoleic acid(la)+gamma-linolenic acid(gla)','Puritans pride','Gel','جل','1000 mg','1','','for centuries epo has been used to provide nutritional support for women with premenstrual syndrome (pms); it may also play a role in promoting smooth healthy-looking skin.** these easy-to-swallow softgels are a natural source of gla (gamma linolenic acid','','',1171,'2022-07-13',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(18671,'Evening primrose oil 500 mg 100 softgels (illegal import)','زيت زهرة الربيع المسائية 500 مجم 100 كبسولة','0','','Evening primrose oil','Evening primrose oil+cis-linoleic acid(la)+gamma-linolenic acid(gla)','Puritans pride','Gel','جل','500 mg','1','','for centuries epo has been used to provide nutritional support for women with premenstrual syndrome (pms); it may also play a role in promoting smooth healthy-looking skin. these easy-to-swallow softgels are a natural source of gla (gamma linolenic acid).','','',956,'2022-08-03',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(18672,'Evirinse vag.douche 250 ml','افرينز دش مهبلي 250 مل','37','','Vaginal wash','Alum+chamomile extract+thymol+menthol+calendula extract+rosemary extract+vitamin c','Macro group pharmaceuticals','Unknown','غير محدد','250 ml','1','','*external wash for intimate female care with bio active vitamin system *helps in restoring healthy vaginal moisturization & natural physiological vaginal ph *contains natural antimicrobial cooling refreshing & soothing ingredients use: 1-2 provided measur','6224000437619','',687,'2022-12-05',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(18673,'Aaa','ششش','95','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','2','','','','',583,'2022-07-30',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(18674,'E-viton 100 mg 20 caps.','اي-فيتون 100مجم 20 كبسولة','3','','Vitamin e','Vitamin e','Kahira','Cap','كبسولة','100 mg','2','','mechanism of action of vitamin e vitamin e acts as an antioxidant and protecting unsaturated lipids in the cell membrane coenzyme q vitamin a vitamin c etc. from free radical oxidation damage and generation of toxic peroxidation products. it also decrease','6221068101070','',1254,'2022-12-05',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'In 1922, vitamin E was demonstrated to be an essential nutrient[A32448].

The result of doing so allows cGMP present in both the penis and pulmonary vasculature to elicit smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation that subsequently facilitates relief in pulmonary arterial hypertension and the increased flow of blood into the spongy erectile tissue of the penis that consequently allows it to grow in size and become erect and rigid [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

Interestingly enough, it is precisely via this mechanism why sildenafil was at first researched as a potential treatment for angina - or chest pain associated with inadequate blood flow to the heart - before being serendipitously indicated for treating erectile dysfunction in the late 1980s [A175732]. Nevertheless, it is because of this mechanism that sildenafil is also indicated for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension but is also additionally notorious for interacting with various anti-anginal or anti-hypertensive agents to develop potentially rapid, excessive, and/or fatal hypotensive crises [A175579, A175582, A175654].

Regardless, sildenafil, among a variety of other similar or related PDE5 inhibitors, has become a common and effective treatment for erectile dysfunction and since its formal approval for medical use in the public in 1998 [A175732], continues to see millions of prescriptions written for it internationally. Although the medication has historically been most popularly recognized as Pfizer''s brand name Viagra, sildenafil is currently available generically and even as a non-prescription over the counter medication in some countries [L5656].','["G01AE10", "G04BE03"]','[]'),(18760,'Ezetimibe 10 mg 10 tab','ازيتيميب 10مجم 10 اقراص','21','14.4','Hypolipidemic agent','Ezetimibe','Borg','Tab','أقراص','10 mg','1','لتقليل الدهون والكوليسترول بالدم','','6223002570652','',2242,'2025-11-03',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Ezetimibe is a lipid-lowering compound that inhibits intestinal cholesterol and phytosterol absorption.

It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infections along with other antibiotics including [DB01060], [DB01211], and [DB00916], for example.[A177271, F4498] Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [DB00338], [DB00213], [DB00448], [DB05351], and [DB01129]. Esomeprazole is the s-isomer of [DB00338], which is a racemate of the S- and R-enantiomer. Esomeprazole has been shown to inhibit acid secretion to a similar extent as [DB00338], without any significant differences between the two compounds _in vitro_. 

Esomeprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of esomeprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, esomeprazole''s duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]

PPIs such as esomeprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as esomeprazole has been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients such as iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]

Rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as esomeprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion.[A177574] Esomeprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing to prevent this rebound effect.','["A02BD06", "A02BC05", "M01AE52"]','[]'),(18764,'Ezypent gel 30 gm','ايزيبنت جل 30 جم','40','','Delay action','Vitamin','Hi-care > pure pharmaceuticals','Pen','قلم','30 gm','1','للتأخير للرجال','the use of ezypent delay gel is perhaps one of the easiest and fastest solutions for men who deal with premature ejaculation. ï¿½ make sure your penis is clean before applying the gel. ï¿½ do not use the product if you have any cut or bruise on your penis','','',1863,'2022-09-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'A11D',NULL),(18766,'Fabb hair oil 60 ml','فاب زيت شعر 60 مل','12','','Hair care','','Cosmopack for cosmetics > digma pharma','Hair oil','زيت شعر','60 ml','1','','','','',964,'2022-07-15',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(18768,'Vonalei vaginal atrophy cream 30 gm','فونالي اتروفي كريم مهبلي 30 جم','600','220','Vaginal care','Lactic acid+hyaluronic acid+aloe vera','Al andalous pharmaceutical services','Cream','كريم','30 gm','1','','','','',1165,'2025-12-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL);

By inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver, statins lower abnormal cholesterol and lipid levels, and ultimately reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid. This conversion is a critical metabolic reaction involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport, including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing statins is considered standard practice for patients following any cardiovascular event, and for people who are at moderate to high risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The evidence supporting statin use, coupled with minimal side effects and long term benefits, has resulted in wide use of this medication in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Atorvastatin and other statins including [lovastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [simvastatin] are considered first-line treatment options for dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] The increasing use of this class of drugs is largely attributed to the rise in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (such as heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke) in many countries.[A181084] An elevated cholesterol level (elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in particular) is a significant risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Several landmark studies demonstrate that the use of statins is associated with both a reduction in LDL levels and CVD risk.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins were shown to reduce the incidences of all-cause mortality, including fatal and non-fatal CVD, as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Some evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within five years) statin use leads to a 20%-22% relative reduction in the number of major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

Atorvastatin was first synthesized in 1985 by Dr. Bruce Roth and approved by the FDA in 1996.[T568] It is a pentasubstituted pyrrole [A177415] formed by two contrasting moieties with an achiral heterocyclic core unit and a 3,5-dihydroxypentanoyl side chain identical to its parent compound.[T571] Unlike other members of the statin group, atorvastatin is an active compound and therefore does not require activation.[A177436]','["C10BA05", "C10BX11", "C10BX12", "C10BX18", "C10AA05", "C10BX15", "C10BX03", "C10BX08", "C10BX06"]','[]');

histamine H1 antagonist proven effective in the treatment of various allergic symptoms, such as sneezing, coughing, nasal congestion, hives, and other symptoms [A175051], [A175054]. 

One of the most common uses for this drug is for a condition called _allergic rhinitis_. The prevalence of allergic rhinitis in the United States is about 15% according to physician diagnoses, and up to 30%, according to self-reported nasal symptoms.

It works in a similar fashion as [dutasteride], which is another 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, by exerting antiandrogenic effects. Finasteride is an orally active drug that was first approved by the FDA in 1992 for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia to improve symptoms and reduce the risk for acute urinary retention or the need for surgical procedures.[L6244,L10565] In 1998, it was approved by the FDA to treat male pattern hair loss.[L6244] Finasteride is commonly marketed under the brand names Propecia and Proscar to be used aloneo or in combination with [doxazosin], an alpha-blocker.

Both benign prostatic hyperplasia and androgenic alopecia are androgen-dependent disorders that are characterized by _in situ_ high levels of DHT.[A178159] In the treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia, alpha-blockers such as [tamsulosin] and [terazosin] are also used. Compared to alpha-blockers that focus on providing the rapid relief of symptoms, 5α-reductase inhibitors aim to target the underlying disease by blocking the effects of the primary androgen involved in benign prostate hyperplasia and androgenic alopecia, thus reducing the risk for secondary complications while providing symptom control.[A2132]','["D11AX10", "G04CA51", "G04CB01"]','[]'),(19041,'Fine derm 0.25% rectal cream 30 gm','فاين ديرم 0.25% كريم شرجي 30 جرام','80','65','Haemorrhoids','Glyceryl trinitrate+clove oil+panthenol+grape seed oil+chamomile ext.+wheat germ oil+dimethicon','Healthy group for cosmetics > aim pharmaceuticals','Cream','كريم','0.25%','1','كرم شرجى مضاد للالتهابات ومسكن للالام يستخدم فى حالة البواسير','for haemorrhoids','','',3176,'2024-12-19',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(19042,'Fine derm 0.25% rectal cream 50 gm','فاين ديرم 0.25% كريم 50 جم','95','79.75','Haemorrhoids','Glyceryl trinitrate+clove oil+panthenol+grape seed oil+chamomile ext.+wheat germ oil+dimethicon','Healthy group for cosmetics > aim pharmaceuticals','Cream','كريم','0.25%','1','','for haemorrhoids','','',3471,'2024-12-19',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(19043,'Fine trust cream 50 gm','فاين تراست كريم 50 جم','12','','Soothing topical','','Debeiky > trust pharma','Cream','كريم','50 gm','1','','soothing cream','','',742,'2022-07-18',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(19044,'Finepanthenol 5% cream 20 gm','فاين بانثينول 5% كريم 20 جرام','5','','Moisturizing topicals','Dexapanthenol','Memphis','Cream','كريم','5%','1','','dexapanthenol-containing creams have been widely used for treatment of lesions (superficial wounds) of the skin and mucous membranes. dexapanthenol is converted in tissues to pantothenic acid a component of coenzyme a. coenzyme a catalyses early steps in','6221050130088','',1080,'2022-12-05',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(19045,'Fini-pure topical cream 50 gm','فيني-بيور كريم موضعي','38','','Diaper rash cream','Zinc oxide+dimethicone+chamomile+jojoba oil+avocado oil+olive oil+honey','Italian cosmetics company > npa','Cream','كريم','50 gm','1','كريم مرطب لمنطقة الحفاض -- الحماية من التسلخات -- ترطيب الجلد و حمايته','diaper rash treatment','','',1945,'2022-04-09',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(19047,'Finitrue topical gel 80 gm','فينيترو جل موضعي 80 جم','89','56','Massage gel','Mentol oil+camphor oil+clove oil+equalyptus oil+vitamin e','Italian cosmetics company > npa','Gel','جل','80 gm','1','جل مساج للجسم -- علاج الشد العضلي -- استرخاء العضلات -- تقليل الالام العضلات والمفاصل','','','',1492,'2025-11-12',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(19049,'Aaa','ششش','11','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',771,'2022-07-27',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(19050,'Despruderm 0.05% topical lotion 60 ml','ديسبروديرم لوشن 60 مل','66','46','Glucocorticoid','Desonide','Egpi > glenmark pharmaceuticals','Lotion','لوشن','0.05%','1','','','','',810,'2025-11-03',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'None','[]','[]'),(19051,'Finshape 120mg 30 caps.','فينشيب 120مجم 30 كبسولة','240','216','Weight loss','Orlistat','Mash premiere','Cap','كبسولة','120mg','3','','about orlistat anti-obese drug. saturated derivative of lipstatin. mechanism of action of orlistat its primary function is preventing the absorption of fats from the human diet thereby reducing caloric intake.orlistat works by inhibiting gastric and pancr','6222001402209','',1836,'2025-12-12',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'The global prevalence of obesity is increasing rapidly.
