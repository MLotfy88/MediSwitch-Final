Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Rosuvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [simvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] This is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than [atorvastatin]''s effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial[A181427] concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.

Rosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]', '["C10BX10", "C10BX05", "C10BX07", "C10AA07", "A10BH52", "G01AE10", "C10BX13", "C10BX09", "C10BA09", "C10BX16", "C10BX17", "C10BX14", "C10BA06"]', '[]');

It works in a similar fashion as [dutasteride], which is another 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, by exerting antiandrogenic effects. Finasteride is an orally active drug that was first approved by the FDA in 1992 for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia to improve symptoms and reduce the risk for acute urinary retention or the need for surgical procedures.[L6244,L10565] In 1998, it was approved by the FDA to treat male pattern hair loss.[L6244] Finasteride is commonly marketed under the brand names Propecia and Proscar to be used aloneo or in combination with [doxazosin], an alpha-blocker.

Both benign prostatic hyperplasia and androgenic alopecia are androgen-dependent disorders that are characterized by _in situ_ high levels of DHT.[A178159] In the treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia, alpha-blockers such as [tamsulosin] and [terazosin] are also used. Compared to alpha-blockers that focus on providing the rapid relief of symptoms, 5α-reductase inhibitors aim to target the underlying disease by blocking the effects of the primary androgen involved in benign prostate hyperplasia and androgenic alopecia, thus reducing the risk for secondary complications while providing symptom control.[A2132]', '["D11AX10", "G04CA51", "G04CB01"]', '[]');
