After symptoms resolve, the infusion may be resumed at the same or lower dose as clinically appropriate. If pulse oximetry reveals hypoxia, immediately stop the infusion and do not resume infusion following resolution of the hypoxia. Patients should be cautioned against driving, operating machinery, or engaging in potentially hazardous activities requiring mental alertness and motor coordination until sedative effects of brexanolone and other concomitant medications have dissipated.",
