It is used to provide local anesthesia by nerve blockade at various sites in the body [F4349, L5930, L5948]. It does so by stabilizing the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action [F4349, L5930, L5948]. In particular, the lidocaine agent acts on sodium ion channels located on the internal surface of nerve cell membranes [F4349, L5930, L5948]. At these channels, neutral uncharged lidocaine molecules diffuse through neural sheaths into the axoplasm where they are subsequently ionized by joining with hydrogen ions [F4349, L5930, L5948]. The resultant lidocaine cations are then capable of reversibly binding the sodium channels from the inside, keeping them locked in an open state that prevents nerve depolarization [F4349, L5930, L5948]. As a result, with sufficient blockage, the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron will ultimately not depolarize and will thus fail to transmit an action potential [F4349, L5930, L5948]. This facilitates an anesthetic effect by not merely preventing pain signals from propagating to the brain but by aborting their generation in the first place [F4349, L5930, L5948].



In addition to blocking conduction in nerve axons in the peripheral nervous system, lidocaine has important effects on the central nervous system and cardiovascular system [F4349, L5930, L5948]. After absorption, lidocaine may cause stimulation of the CNS followed by depression and in the cardiovascular system, it acts primarily on the myocardium where it may produce decreases in electrical excitability, conduction rate, and force of contraction [F4349, L5930, L5948].', 'Excessive blood levels of lidocaine can cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure [F4349, L5930]. With central neural blockade these changes may be attributable to the block of autonomic fibers, a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system, and/or the beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating action of epinephrine when present [F4349, L5930]. The net effect is normally a modest hypotension when the recommended dosages are not exceeded [F4349, L5930].



In particular, such cardiac effects are likely associated with the principal effect that lidocaine elicits when it binds and blocks sodium channels, inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of electrical action potential impulses necessary to facilitate muscle contraction [F4349, L5930, L5948]. Subsequently, in cardiac myocytes, lidocaine can potentially block or otherwise slow the rise of cardiac action potentials and their associated cardiac myocyte contractions, resulting in possible effects like hypotension, bradycardia, myocardial depression, cardiac arrhythmias, and perhaps cardiac arrest or circulatory collapse [F4349, L5930, L5948].



Moreover, lidocaine possesses a dissociation constant (pKa) of 7.7 and is considered a weak base [L5948]. As a result, about 25% of lidocaine molecules will be un-ionized and available at the physiological pH of 7.4 to translocate inside nerve cells, which means lidocaine elicits an onset of action more rapidly than other local anesthetics that have higher pKa values [L5948]. This rapid onset of action is demonstrated in about one minute following intravenous injection and fifteen minutes following intramuscular injection [L5930]. The administered lidocaine subsequently spreads rapidly through the surrounding tissues and the anesthetic effect lasts approximately ten to twenty minutes when given intravenously and about sixty to ninety minutes after intramuscular injection [L5930].



Nevertheless, it appears that the efficacy of lidocaine may be minimized in the presence of inflammation [L5948]. This effect could be due to acidosis decreasing the amount of un-ionized lidocaine molecules, a more rapid reduction in lidocaine concentration as a result of increased blood flow, or potentially also because of increased production of inflammatory mediators like peroxynitrite that elicit direct actions on sodium channels [L5948].', 'DrugBank');

Signaling through the histamine H1 receptor is thought to primarily promote the activation of inflammatory reactions, such as allergy, asthma, and autoimmune diseases.[A179731] H1 receptor signaling activates the intracellular transcription factors, such as IP3, PLC, PKC, DAG, and intracellular calcium ions, which all work to activate further downstream cascades. Activated downstream cascades lead to the production of cytokines, the release of mast cell inflammatory mediators, synthesis of prostacyclins, activation of platelet factor, as well as the synthesis of nitric oxide, arachidonic acid, and thromboxane, which all contribute to inflammatory reactions.[A179731] 



Olopatadine is an anti-allergic molecule that works via several mechanisms. As a mast cell stabilizer, it stabilizes rodent basophils and human conjunctival mast cells and inhibits the immunologically-stimulated release of histamine.[A179704] Olopatadine acts as an antagonist at the histamine H1 receptors with high selectivity, which is explained by a unique receptor binding pocket that consists of the aspartate residue in the third transmembrane helix and other sites in the H1 receptor.[A1170] Upon binding, olopatadine blocks the H1 receptor signaling pathway, inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators, such as tryptase, prostaglandin D2, TNF-alpha, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines.[L6790] It also decreases chemotaxis and inhibits eosinophil activation.[L6781] _In vitro_, olopatadine was shown to inhibit epithelial cell intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), which promotes the recruitment of migrating pro-inflammatory mediators.[A179704]', 'Inflammatory reactions in response to various stimuli are mediated by endogenous mediators and other pro-inflammatory factors.

These folic acid congeners are transported across cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis where they are needed to maintain normal erythropoiesis, synthesize purine and thymidylate nucleic acids, interconvert amino acids, methylate tRNA, and generate and use formate. Using vitamin B12 as a cofactor, folic acid can normalize high homocysteine levels by remethylation of homocysteine to methionine via methionine synthetase.', 'Folic acid is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin found in foods such as liver, kidney, yeast, and leafy, green vegetables. Also known as folate or Vitamin B9, folic acid is an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in DNA and RNA synthesis. More specifically, folic acid is required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. Folic acid is the precursor of tetrahydrofolic acid, which is involved as a cofactor for transformylation reactions in the biosynthesis of purines and thymidylates of nucleic acids. Impairment of thymidylate synthesis in patients with folic acid deficiency is thought to account for the defective deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis that leads to megaloblast formation and megaloblastic and macrocytic anemias. Folic acid is particularly important during phases of rapid cell division, such as infancy, pregnancy, and erythropoiesis, and plays a protective factor in the development of cancer. As humans are unable to synthesize folic acid endogenously, diet and supplementation is necessary to prevent deficiencies. In order to function properly within the body, folic acid must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted by anti-metabolite therapies such as [DB00563] as they function as DHFR inhibitors to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, and therefore prevent the formation of DHF and THF.

PPIs such as esomeprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health.

', '**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].



Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].



In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].



There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].



Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].



The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. 



In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].



In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].



The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].', 'Zinc is involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of human proteins may bind zinc, in addition to hundreds of proteins that transport and traffic zinc. It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is an essential element for a proper sense of taste and smell and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations [L2211].



Studies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions [L2095]:



**Colds:** Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently [L2095].



**Wound healing:** Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements [L2095]. 



**Diahrrea**: Oral zinc supplements can reduce the symptoms of diarrhea in children with low levels of zinc, especially in cases of malnutrition [L2095].

A complex of tacrolimus-FKBP-12, calcium, calmodulin, and calcineurin is then formed and the phosphatase activity of calcineurin is inhibited. This prevents the dephosphorylation and translocation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NF-AT), a nuclear component thought to initiate gene transcription for the formation of lymphokines. Tacrolimus also inhibits the transcription for genes which encode IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, GM-CSF, and TNF-, all of which are involved in the early stages of T-cell activation.

Doxycycline ultimately impedes the elongation phase of protein synthesis and halts the production of essential proteins for bacterial survival and functioning.[A251725, A251730]



Doxycycline mediates anti-inflammatory actions by preventing calcium-dependent microtubular assembly and lymphocytic proliferation, thereby inhibiting leukocyte movement during inflammation.[A251730] It also inhibits nitric oxide synthase, which is an enzyme that produces nitric oxide, an inflammatory signaling molecule.[A251730]', 'Doxycycline and other tetracyclines are mainly bacteriostatic and are thought to exert antimicrobial effects by the inhibition of protein synthesis. They suppress the growth of bacteria or keep them in the stationary phase of growth.[A174025] Tetracyclines have antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms.[L42870] Cross-resistance of these microorganisms to tetracyclines is a common occurrence.[L42870] 



As it is a highly lipophilic drug, doxycycline crosses multiple membranes of target molecules.[A251730] Doxycycline shows favorable intra-cellular penetration, with bacteriostatic activity against a wide range of bacteria.[A174028] Doxycycline also exhibits antiparasitic properties [A372, A373, A174025] and anti-inflammatory actions.[A174031, A251730] Its anti-inflammatory effects were investigated in various inflammatory skin conditions, such as bullous dermatoses [A251730] and rosacea.[A174031, A251730]', 'DrugBank');

It is often used in combination with [misoprostol] as a gastro-protective agent in patients with high risk of developing NSAID-induced ulcers.', 'Diclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 and -2, the enzymes responsible for production of prostaglandin (PG) G<sub>2</sub> which is the precursor to other PGs.[label,T116] These molecules have broad activity in pain and inflammation and the inhibition of their production is the common mechanism linking each effect of diclofenac.



PGE<sub>2</sub> is the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.[A179023] It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.[T116,A179023] PGE<sub>2</sub> activates the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled EP<sub>1</sub> receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE<sub>2</sub> also activates the EP<sub>4</sub> receptor, coupled to G<sub>s</sub>, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE<sub>2</sub> act via EP<sub>3</sub> to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP<sub>2</sub> to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI<sub>2</sub> is known to play a role via its G<sub>s</sub>-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.



PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP<sub>2</sub> receptors.[T116,A179044] Similarly to β adrenergic receptors these are G<sub>s</sub>-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE<sub>2</sub> also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.[T116] PGD<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP<sub>1</sub> receptor.[A179044] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.



PGE<sub>2</sub> can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory G<sub>q</sub> EP<sub>3</sub> receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.[T116] This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever. NSAIDs prevent the generation of PGE<sub>2</sub> thereby reducing the activity of these neurons.

As with all antibiotics, tobramycin use should be limited to cases where bacterial infections are known or strongly suspected to be caused by sensitive organisms, and the possible emergence of resistance should be monitored closely.[L32739,L32744,L32749]', 'Tobramycin is a 4,6-disubstituted 2-deoxystreptamine (DOS) ring-containing aminoglycoside antibiotic with activity against various Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria.[L32739, L32744, L32749] The mechanism of action of tobramycin has not been unambiguously elucidated, and some insights into its mechanism rely on results using similar aminoglycosides. In general, like other aminoglycosides, tobramycin is bactericidal and exhibits both immediate and delayed killing, which are attributed to different mechanisms, as outlined below.[A232294, A232299]



Aminoglycosides are polycationic at physiological pH, such that they readily bind to bacterial membranes ("ionic binding"); this includes binding to lipopolysaccharide and phospholipids within the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and to teichoic acid and phospholipids within the cell membrane of Gram-positive bacteria. This binding displaces divalent cations and increases membrane permeability, which allows aminoglycoside entry.[A232294, A232304, A232309, A232314] Additional aminoglycoside entry ("energy-dependent phase I") into the cytoplasm requires the proton-motive force, allowing access of the aminoglycoside to its primary intracellular target of the bacterial 30S ribosome.[A232294, A232314] Mistranslated proteins produced as a result of aminoglycoside binding to the ribosome (see below) integrate into and disrupt the cell membrane, which allows more of the aminoglycoside into the cell ("energy-dependent phase II").[A232294, A232314, A232319] Hence, tobramycin and other aminoglycosides have both immediate bactericidal effects through membrane disruption and delayed bactericidal effects through impaired protein synthesis; observed experimental data and mathematical modelling support this two-mechanism model.[A232294, A232299]



Inhibition of protein synthesis was the first recognized effect of aminoglycoside antibiotics. Structural and cell biological studies suggest that aminoglycosides bind to the 16S rRNA in helix 44 (h44), near the A site of the 30S ribosomal subunit, altering interactions between h44 and h45. This binding also displaces two important residues, A1492 and A1493, from h44, mimicking normal conformational changes that occur with successful codon-anticodon pairing in the A site.[A232324, A232329] Overall, aminoglycoside binding has several negative effects, including inhibiting translation initiation and elongation and ribosome recycling.[A232294, A232334, A232339] Recent evidence suggests that the latter effect is due to a cryptic second binding site situated in h69 of the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit.[A232329, A232339] Also, by stabilizing a conformation that mimics correct codon-anticodon pairing, aminoglycosides promote error-prone translation;[A232344] mistranslated proteins can incorporate into the cell membrane, inducing the damage discussed above.[A232294, A232319]



Although direct mutation of the 16S rRNA is a rare resistance mechanism, due to the gene being present in numerous copies, posttranscriptional 16S rRNA modification by 16S rRNA methyltransferases (16S-RMTases) at the N7 position of G1405 or the N1 position of A1408 are common resistance mechanisms in aminoglycoside-resistant bacteria.[A232294, A232349] These mutants also further support the proposed mechanism of action of aminoglycosides. Direct modification of the aminoglycoside itself through acetylation, adenylation, and phosphorylation by aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (AMEs) are also commonly encountered resistance mutations.[A232294, A232349] Finally, due to the requirement for active transport of aminoglycosides across bacterial membranes, they are not active against obligately anaerobic bacteria.[A232294]', 'Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic derived from the actinomycete _Streptomyces tenebrarius_.[L32749] It has a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-negative bacteria, including _Enterobacteriaceae_, _Escherichia coli_, _Klebsiella pneumoniae_, _Morganella morganii_, _Moraxella lacunata_, _Proteus_ spp., _Haemophilus_ spp., _Acinetobacter_ spp., _Neisseria_ spp., and, importantly, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_. Aminoglycosides also generally retain activity against the biothreat agents _Yersinia pestis_ and _Francisella tularensis_.

Like other aminoglycosides, tobramycin is taken up and retained by proximal tubule and cochlear cells in the kidney and ear, respectively, and hence carries a risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity.[A232294, L32749] There is also a risk of neuromuscular block, which may be more pronounced in patients with preexisting neuromuscular disorders such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson''s disease.[A232294, L32739, L32749] Aminoglycosides can cross the placenta, resulting in total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in babies born to mothers who were administered an aminoglycoside during pregnancy.[L32739, L32749] Due to the low systemic absorption of inhaled and topical tobramycin formulations, these effects are more pronounced with injected tobramycin than with other formulations.[L32739, L32744, L32749] However, all formulations carry a risk of hypersensitivity reactions, including potentially fatal cutaneous reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.[L32739, L32744, L32749]', 'DrugBank');

The oral troche preparation is indicated for the local treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis [FDA label].  It is also indicated as a prophylactic drug to reduce the incidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis in patients immunocompromised by conditions such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or steroid therapy utilized in the treatment of leukemia, solid tumors, or renal transplantation [FDA label]. Troche preparations are not indicated for the treatment of any systemic mycoses [FDA label].', 'Clotrimazole acts primarily by damaging the permeability barrier in the cell membrane of fungi. Clotrimazole causes inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis, an essential constituent of fungal cell membranes. If ergosterol synthesis is either completely or partially inhibited, the cell is no longer able to construct an intact and functional cell membrane [F3088],[F3100]. Because ergosterol directly promotes the growth of fungal cells in a hormone‐like fashion, rapid onset of the above events leads to dose-dependent inhibition of fungal growth [A174094].



Though decreased ergosterol, due to the inhibition of lanosterol 14-demethylase (also known as _CYP51_) [A174094] is accepted to be primarily responsible for the antimycotic properties of clotrimazole, this drug also shows other pharmacological effects. These include the inhibition of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+‐ATPase,  depletion of intracellular calcium, and blocking of calcium‐dependent potassium channels and voltage‐dependent calcium channels [A174094]. The action of clotrimazole on these targets accounts for other effects of this drug that are separate from its antimycotic activities [A174094].', 'Clotrimazole is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent that inhibits the growth of pathogenic yeasts by changing the permeability of cell membranes. The action of clotrimazole is fungistatic at concentrations of drug up to 20 mcg/mL and may be fungicidal _in vitro_ against Candida albicans and other species of the genus Candida at higher concentrations [FDA label]. Unfortunately, resistance to clotrimazole, which was rare in the past, is now common in various patient populations [A174094]. 



Clotrimazole is generally considered to be a fungistatic, and not a fungicidal drug, although this contrast is not absolute, as clotrimazole shows fungicidal properties at higher concentrations [A174094].

Two of these, methylcobalamin and 5-deoxyadenosyl cobalamin, are primarily used by the body. Methionine synthase needs methylcobalamin as a cofactor. This enzyme is involved in the conversion of the amino acid homocysteine into methionine. Methionine in turn is required for DNA methylation. 5-Deoxyadenosyl cobalamin is a cofactor needed by the enzyme that converts L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. This conversion is an important step in the extraction of energy from proteins and fats. Furthermore, succinyl CoA is necessary for the production of hemoglobin, the substances that carries oxygen in red blood cells.', 'Hydroxocobalamin is a synthetic, injectable form of Vitamin B12. Hydroxocobalamin is actually a precursor of two cofactors or vitamins (Vitamin B12 and Methylcobalamin) which are involved in various biological systems in man. Vitamin B12 is required for the conversion of methylmalonate to succinate. Deficiency of this enzyme could therefore interfere with the production of lipoprotein in myelin sheath tissue and so give rise to neurological lesions. The second cofactor, Methylcobalamin, is necessary for the conversion of homocysteine to methionine which is essential for the metabolism of folic acid. Deficiency of tetrahydrafolate leads to reduced synthesis of thymidylate resulting in reduced synthesis of DNA which is essential for cell maturation. Vitamin B12 is also concerned in the maintenance of sulphydryl groups in reduced form, deficiency leading to decreased amounts of reduced SH content of erythrocytes and liver cells. Overall, vitamin B12 acts as a coenzyme for various metabolic functions, including fat and carbohydrate metabolism and protein synthesis. It is necessary for growth, cell replication, hematopoiesis, and nucleoprotein as well as myelin synthesis. This is largely due to its effects on metabolism of methionine folic acid, and malonic acid.', 'DrugBank');

Under EMA approval, such fish oil pharmaceuticals comprised of virtually the same fish and fish oil derived omega-3-fatty acids EPA and DHA are indicated specifically for (a) adjuvant treatment in secondary prevention after myocardial infarction, in addition to other standard therapy (ie. statins, antiplatelet medicinal products, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors), and (b) as a supplement to diet when dietary measures alone are insufficient to produce an adequate response, particularly with type IV hypertriglyceridemia in monotherapy or type IIb/III in combination with statins, when control of triglycerides is insufficient [L2661]. In addition, prescribing information for EMA approved fish oil pharmaceuticals are also indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce very high (>=500 mg/dL) triglyceride levels in adult patients, much like similar FDA approved indications [F37, FDA Label].', 'The specific mechanism of action by which the fish oil EPA and DHA acids are capable of reducing serum triglyceride levels is not yet fully understood [FDA Label, A32933]. Nevertheless, it is proposed that such omega-3-fatty acids may not be the preferred substrates of the enzyme diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase that participates in the generation of triglycerides; that  they might interact with nuclear transcription factors that manage lipogenesis; or that their presence and increase in levels can cause cellular metabolism to subsequently shift toward a decrease in triglyceride synthesis and an increase in fatty acid oxidation [A32933]. Moreover, the EPA and DHA acids are also believed to be able to promote apolipoprotein B degradation in the liver through the stimulation of an autophagic process [A32933]. It may also be possible that these fish oil acids can accelerate the clearance of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles and chylomicron [A32933]. The combination of all these actions results in fewer VLDL particles being assembled and secreted, which is of considerable importance as VLDL particles are the major endogenous source of triglycerides [A32933].



Moreover, new paradigms of how inflammation is contained and dissipated involve various newly discovered chemical mediators, resolvins, and protectins [A32933]. Such agents are believed to be directly involved in blocking neutrophil migration, infiltration, recruitment, as well as blocking T-cell migration and promoting T-cell apoptosis [A32933]. Additionally, such protectins can also reduce tumor necrosis factor and interferon secretion [A32933]. Of particular importance, however, is the fact that protectins and resolvins are exclusively derived from omega-3-fatty acids and that EPA is the substrate of the resolvins family and DHA can be converted to both resolvins and protectins [A32933]. It is believed that these effects of such fish oil acids underlie the actions that fish oil have demonstrated on eliciting stability for vulnerable inflammatory plaques [A32933].



Finally, fish oil acids have demonstrated certain direct electrophysiological effects on the myocardium [A32933]. In animal studies, it was shown that the ventricular fibrillation threshold could be increased in both animals fed or infused with omega-3-fatty acids [A32933]. Further studies subsequently revealed that such fatty acids could reduce both sodium currents and L-type calcium currents on a cellular and ion channel level [A32933]. It is consequently hypothesized that during ischemia, a reduction in the sodium ion current protects hyperexcitable tissue, and a reduction in the calcium ion current could reduce arrhythmogenic depolarizing currents - and that perhaps the use of EPA and DHA fish oil acids could facilitate such activity [A32933]. For the time being, however, omega-3-fatty acids in pharmaceutical supplement form have not been shown to elicit such protection against heart conditions [L2662].', 'In general, the only practical method of obtaining and increasing the levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) fish oil omega-3-fatty acids in the body is to consume them directly from foods and/or dietary supplements [L784]. Having EPA and DHA is important because they facilitate numerous important functions in the human body. As an example, such supplementation of fish oil EPA and DHA demonstrates a legitimate ability to decrease triglyceride levels as their presence in the body can act as poor substrates for the enzymes that are ordinarily responsible for triglyceride synthesis and also inhibit the esterification of other fatty acids, among other mechanisms [FDA Label, L2661].



Moreover, such fish oil acids can become important components of the phospholipids that form the structures of cell membranes [L784]. Specifically, DHA is particularly high in the retina, brain, and sperm [L784]. Additionally, these acids also provide energy for the body and are used to form eicosanoids - signaling molecules that have similar chemical structures to the fish oil fatty acids from which they are derived [L784]. Furthermore, such eicosanoids possess wide-ranging functions in the cardiovascular, pulmonary, immune, and endocrine systems [L784].', 'DrugBank');

Cineol containing preparations of eucalyptus oil may contain up to 80% (or more) 1,8-cineole [A32243] and is one of the most common types of eucalyptus oil formulations used. As an active agent indicated for relieving certain cold symptoms and/or certain muscular sprains and cramps, it is believed that eucalyptus oil may possess some antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities.



Some in vitro studies of human blood monocytes suggest a dose-dependent effect of eucalyptus oil to elicit significant inhibition of multiple cytokines, perhaps in the treatment of airway inflammation [A32244, A32245]. Moreover, other studies in animal models discuss the possibility of eucalyptus oil demonstrating anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects that potentially account for inhibiting the formation of prostaglandins and cytokines by stimulated monocytes in vitro [A32246, A32247].



Furthermore, additional studies have observed eucalyptus oil anti-viral activity against herpes simplex virus (HSV-1, HSV-2) in cell cultures as well as the demonstration of broad antimicrobial activity of eucalyptus medicinal plant extracts against Alicyclobacillus acidoterretris, Bacillus cereus, E. coli, Enterococcus faecalis, MRSA, Propionibacterium acnes, S. aureus, fungus including C. albicans isolates, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and other Gram-positive bacteria. Specific activity against periodontopathic bacteria, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sobrinus has also been observed [A32250, A32251, A32252, A32253, A32254].', 'Lipophilic monoterpene formulations of eucalyptus oil appear to be readily absorbed orally, with a primarily oxidative metabolism that might necessitate induction of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system and subsequent urinary excretion [A32236]. Gastrointestinal absorption of eucalyptus appears to be rapid and may be enhanced by the intake of lipids and milk. 1,8-cineole (which makes up to as much as 90% of most commonly used cineole-based eucalyptus oils) [A32227] has also been found in vitro and in animals to possess cytochrome P450 inducing activity [A32237, A32238, A32239].', 'DrugBank');

Additionally, lactulose is also employed as an adjunct to protein restriction and supportive therapy for the prevention and treatment of portal-systemic encephalopathy (PSE), including both the hepatic pre-coma and coma variations.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] In particular, lactulose solution has been effective at managing PSE resulting from surgical portacaval shunts or from chronic hepatic diseases like cirrhosis.[L6199]



Moreover, there have also been studies demonstrating the capacity for lactulose to minimize the formation of gallstones and even some investigations regarding the experimental use of the agent in developing novel anticancer agents owing to its ability to bind galactin carbohydrates involved in various tumor progressions [L6202].', 'Lactulose is a synthetic disaccharide derivative of lactose that consists of one molecule of galactose and one molecule of fructose.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] Saccharolytic bacteria present in the large intestine subsequently break the substance down into organic acids like lactic acid and small amounts of formic and acetic acids.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] Such resultant volatile fatty acid metabolites, in combination with hydrogen and methane that is also generated consequently enhance intraluminal gas formation, peristaltic gut motility, and elicit an osmotic effect that facilitates an increase in the water content of stool as well as associated stool softening.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] All of these actions ultimately assist in facilitating and increasing the frequency of bowel movements in patients experiencing constipation, although it may take 24 to 48 hours after using the medication for this laxative effect to become evident.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]



At the same time, the formation of such acids via the metabolism of lactulose by colonic bacteria also acidifies the contents of the colon, thereby contributing to the treatment of portal-systemic encephalopathy (PSE).[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] As one of the principal features of PSE involves the accumulation of nitrogenous waste products like ammonia in the systemic circulation, a state in which the colonic contents become more acidic than blood allows ammonia in the circulation to diffuse into the colon.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]. Furthermore, ammonia that diffuses into the acidic colon is ionized to ammonium ions that are incapable of being absorbed back into the blood.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] These effects, combined with the laxative action of lactulose facilitates the excretion of excess ammonia.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] And finally, it is also believed that an acidic colonic environment results in the elimination of urease-producing bacteria that contribute to the formation of ammonia while surviving colonic bacteria use up any trapped ammonia in the colon as a source of nitrogen for protein synthesis.[L6202]', 'Lactulose formulations are most commonly administered via the oral route or the rectal route.[L6202] Consequently, because the substance experiences minimal absorption by the gut it typically remains localized in the gastrointestinal tract environment and ultimately demonstrates almost all of its pharmacologic effects within the gut.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] In particular, as lactulose elicits its laxative effects in enhancing stool amounts and softening stool, such biochemical and physiologic activities can cause increased bowel sounds (borborygmi), a feeling of bloatedness, belching, frequent flatus, and diarrhea.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]   ', 'DrugBank');

This is supported by the finding that co-administration of calcium channel blockers like nicarpidine and nifedipine renders 50% of Schistosoma mansoni resistant to praziquantel.[L50021,A1664]



Increased exposure of antigens on the worm surface was also observed, but little research has been done to elucidate on the mechanism of action.[A1664]', 'In vitro studies on trematodes and cestodes have shown that praziquantel induces a rapid contraction of schistosomas by a specific effect on the permeability of the cell membrane. The drug further causes vacuolization and disintegration of the schistosome tegument. The effect is more marked on adult worms compared to young worms.

Secondary effects are inhibition of glucose uptake, lowering of glycogen levels and stimulation of lactate release. The action of praziquantel is specific to trematodes and cestodes; nematodes (including filariae) are not affected.[L40268]



Praziquantel is active against schistosoma (for example, Schistosoma mekongi, Schistosoma japonicum, Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma hematobium), and infections due to the liver flukes, Clonorchis sinensis/Opisthorchis viverrini. Published in vitro data have shown a potential lack of efficacy of praziquantel against migrating schistosomulae.[L50021]



An interesting quirk of praziquantel is that it is relatively ineffective against juvenile schistosomes.

', '**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].



Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].



In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].



There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].



Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].



The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. 



In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].



In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].



The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].', 'Zinc is involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of human proteins may bind zinc, in addition to hundreds of proteins that transport and traffic zinc. It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is an essential element for a proper sense of taste and smell and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations [L2211].



Studies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions [L2095]:



**Colds:** Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently [L2095].



**Wound healing:** Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements [L2095]. 



**Diahrrea**: Oral zinc supplements can reduce the symptoms of diarrhea in children with low levels of zinc, especially in cases of malnutrition [L2095].

Thrombin is a serine protease that is required to activate fibrinogen to fibrin, which is the loose meshwork that completes the clotting process.

This metabolite is responsible for essentially all of the drug''s activity in-vivo. The mechanism of action of leflunomide has not been fully determined, but appears to primarily involve regulation of autoimmune lymphocytes. It has been suggested that leflunomide exerts its immunomodulating effects by preventing the expansion of activated autoimmune lymphocytes via interferences with cell cycle progression. In-vitro data indicates that leflunomide interferes with cell cycle progression by inhibiting dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (a mitochondrial enzyme involved in de novo pyrimidine ribonucleotide uridine monophosphate (rUMP)synthesis) and has antiproliferative activity. Human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase consists of 2 domains: an α/β-barrel domain containing the active site and an α-helical domain that forms a tunnel leading to the active site. A77 1726 binds to the hydrophobic tunnel at a site near the flavin mononucleotide. Inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase by A77 1726 prevents production of rUMP by the de novo pathway; such inhibition leads to decreased rUMP levels, decreased DNA and RNA synthesis, inhibition of cell proliferation, and G1 cell cycle arrest. It is through this action that leflunomide inhibits autoimmune T-cell proliferation and production of autoantibodies by B cells. Since salvage pathways are expected to sustain cells arrested in the G1 phase, the activity of leflunomide is cytostatic rather than cytotoxic. Other effects that result from reduced rUMP levels include interference with adhesion of activated lymphocytes to the synovial vascular endothelial cells, and increased synthesis of immunosuppressive cytokines such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). Leflunomide is also a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Tyrosine kinases activate signalling pathways leading to DNA repair, apoptosis and cell proliferation. Inhibition of tyrosine kinases can help to treating cancer by preventing repair of tumor cells. ', 'Leflunomide is a pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor indicated in adults for the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is an auto-immune disease characterized by high T-cell activity. T cells have two pathways to synthesize pyrimidines: the salvage pathways and the de novo synthesis. At rest, T lymphocytes meet their metabolic requirements by the salvage pathway. Activated lymphocytes need to expand their pyrimidine pool 7- to 8-fold, while the purine pool is expanded only 2- to 3-fold. To meet the need for more pyrimidines, activated T cells use the de novo pathway for pyrimidine synthesis. Therefore, activated T cells, which are dependent on de novo pyrimidine synthesis, will be more affected by leflunomide''s inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase than other cell types that use the salvage pathway of pyrimidine synthesis.', 'DrugBank');

However, ibuprofen is considered an NSAID and thus it is a non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, which is an enzyme involved in prostaglandin (mediators of pain and fever) and thromboxane (stimulators of blood clotting) synthesis via the arachidonic acid pathway.[L4614]



Ibuprofen is a non-selective COX inhibitor and hence, it inhibits the activity of both COX-1 and COX-2. The inhibition of COX-2 activity decreases the synthesis of prostaglandins involved in mediating inflammation, pain, fever, and swelling while the inhibition of COX-1 is thought to cause some of the side effects of ibuprofen including GI ulceration.[A39195]', 'Ibuprofen has multiple actions in different inflammatory pathways involved in acute and chronic inflammation. The main effects reported in ibuprofen are related to the control of pain, fever and acute inflammation by the inhibition of the synthesis of prostanoids by COX-1 and COX-2. Pain relief is attributed to peripheral affected regions and central nervous system effects in the pain transmission mediated by the dorsal horn and higher spinothalamic tract. Some reports have tried to link the pain regulation with a possible enhancement on the synthesis of endogenous cannabinoids and action on the NMDA receptors. The effect on pain has been shown to be related to the cortically evoked potentials.[A39190]



The antipyretic effect is reported to be linked to the effect on the prostanoid synthesis due to the fact that the prostanoids are the main signaling mediator of pyresis in the hypothalamic-preoptic region.[A39190]



The use of ibuprofen in dental procedures is attributed to the local inhibition of prostanoid production as well as to anti-oedemic activity and an increase of plasma beta-endorphins. Some reports have suggested a rapid local reduction of the expression of COX-2 in dental pulp derived by the administration of ibuprofen.[A39190]



The administration of ibuprofen in patients with rheumatic diseases has shown to control joint symptoms.[A39092] 



Ibuprofen is largely used in OTC products such as an agent for the management of dysmenorrhea which has been proven to reduce the amount of menstrual prostanoids and to produce a reduction in the uterine hypercontractility.[A39181] As well, it has been reported to reduce significantly the fever and the pain caused by migraines.[A39182, A39183] This effect is thought to be related to the effect on platelet activation and thromboxane A2 production which produces local vascular effects in the affected regions. This effect is viable as ibuprofen can enter in the central nervous system.[A39190]



In the investigational uses of ibuprofen, it has been reported to reduce neurodegeneration when given in low doses over a long time.[A39184] On the other hand, its use in Parkinson disease is related to the importance of inflammation and oxidative stress in the pathology of this condition.[A39185] The use of ibuprofen for breast cancer is related to a study that shows a decrease of 50% in the rate of breast cancer.[A39186]', 'DrugBank');

Tramadol is also used off-label in the treatment of premature ejaculation.[A173986]', 'Tramadol is a centrally acting μ-opioid receptor agonist and SNRI (serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake-inhibitor) that is structurally related to [codeine] and [morphine]. Tramadol binds weakly to κ- and δ-opioid receptors and to the μ-opioid receptor with 6000-fold less affinity than morphine.[A182300]



Tramadol exists as a racemic mixture consisting of two pharmacologically active enantiomers that both contribute to its analgesic property through different mechanisms: (+)-tramadol and its primary metabolite (+)-O-desmethyl-tramadol (M1) are agonists of the μ opioid receptor while (+)-tramadol inhibits serotonin reuptake and (-)-tramadol inhibits norepinephrine reuptake. These pathways are complementary and synergistic, improving tramadol''s ability to modulate the perception of and response to pain.[A4269] 



In animal models, M1 is up to 6 times more potent than tramadol in producing analgesia and 200 times more potent in μ-opioid binding.[L9257] 



Tramadol has also been shown to affect a number of pain modulators including alpha2-adrenoreceptors, neurokinin 1 receptors, the voltage-gated sodium channel type II alpha subunit[A183728], transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1 - also known as the capsaicin receptor)[A183734], muscarinic receptors (M1 and M3), N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (also known as the NMDA receptor or glutamate receptor)[A17158], Adenosine A1 receptors[A183761], and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.[A17159] 



In addition to the above neuronal targets, tramadol has a number of effects on inflammatory and immune mediators involved in the pain response. This includes inhibitory effects on cytokines, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), nuclear factor-κB, and glial cells as well as a change in the polarization state of M1 macrophages.[A182300]', 'Tramadol modulates the descending pain pathways within the central nervous system through the binding of parent and M1 metabolite to μ-opioid receptors and the weak inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.[A173983,A173980] 



Apart from analgesia, tramadol may produce a constellation of symptoms (including dizziness, somnolence, nausea, constipation, sweating and pruritus) similar to that of other opioids. 



**Central Nervous System**



In contrast to [morphine], tramadol has not been shown to cause histamine release. At therapeutic doses, tramadol has no effect on heart rate, left-ventricular function or cardiac index. Orthostatic hypotension has been observed.[L9257]



Tramadol produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centres. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem centres to increases in CO2 tension and to electrical stimulation. 



Tramadol depresses the cough reflex by a direct effect on the cough centre in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia.



Tramadol causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but

are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce

similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of

oxycodone overdose.[F4679]



Seizures have been reported in patients receiving tramadol within the recommended dosage range. Spontaneous post-marketing reports indicate that seizure risk is increased with doses of tramadol above the recommended range. Risk of convulsions may also increase in patients with epilepsy, those with a history of seizures

or in patients with a recognized risk for seizure (such as head trauma, metabolic disorders,

alcohol and drug withdrawal, CNS infections), or with concomitant use of other drugs known to reduce the seizure threshold.[F4679]



Tramadol can cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs (e.g., anti-depressants, migraine medications). Treatment with the serotoninergic drug should be discontinued if such events (characterized by clusters of symptoms such as hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs, mental status changes including confusion, irritability, extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma) occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated. Tramadol should not be used in combination with MAO inhibitors or serotonin-precursors (such as L-tryptophan, oxitriptan) and should be used with caution in combination with other serotonergic drugs (triptans, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lithium, St. John’s Wort) due to the risk of serotonin syndrome.[F4679]



**Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle**



Tramadol causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.[F4679]



**Endocrine System**



Opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal or -gonadal axes. Some changes that can be seen include an increase in serum prolactin and decreases in plasma cortisol and testosterone. Clinical signs and symptoms may be manifest from these hormonal changes.[F4679]



Hyponatremia has been reported very rarely with the use of tramadol, usually in patients with predisposing risk factors, such as elderly patients and/or patients using concomitant medications that may cause hyponatremia (e.g., antidepressants, benzodiazepines, diuretics). In some reports, hyponatremia appeared to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) and resolved with discontinuation of tramadol and appropriate treatment (e.g., fluid restriction). During tramadol treatment, monitoring for signs and symptoms of hyponatremia is recommended for patients with predisposing risk factors.[F4679]



**Cardiovascular**



Tramadol administration may result in severe hypotension in patients whose ability to maintain adequate blood pressure is compromised by reduced blood volume, or concurrent administration of drugs such as phenothiazines and other tranquillizers, sedative/hypnotics, tricyclic antidepressants or general anesthetics. These patients should be monitored for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of tramadol.[F4679]



**QTc-Interval Prolongation**



The maximum placebo-adjusted mean change from baseline in the QTcF interval was 5.5 ms in the 400 mg/day treatment arm and 6.5 ms in the 600 mg/day mg treatment arm, both occurring at the 8h time point. Both treatment groups were within the 10 ms threshold for QT prolongation. Post-marketing experience with the use of tramadol containing products included rare reports of QT prolongation reported with an overdose. Particular care should be exercised when administering tramadol to patients who are suspected to be at an increased risk of experiencing torsade de pointes during treatment with a QTc-prolonging drug.[F4679]



**Abuse and Misuse**



Like all opioids, tramadol has the potential for abuse and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Therefore, tramadol should be prescribed and handled with caution.[F4679]



**Dependence/Tolerance**



Physical dependence and tolerance reflect the neuroadaptation of the opioid receptors to chronic exposure to an opioid and are separate and distinct from abuse and addiction. Tolerance, as well as physical dependence, may develop upon repeated administration of opioids, and are not by themselves evidence of an addictive disorder or abuse. Patients on prolonged therapy should be tapered gradually from the drug if it is no longer required for pain control. Withdrawal symptoms may occur following abrupt discontinuation of therapy or upon administration of an opioid antagonist. Some of the symptoms that may be associated with abrupt withdrawal of an opioid analgesic include body aches, diarrhea, gooseflesh, loss of appetite, nausea, nervousness or restlessness, anxiety, runny nose, sneezing, tremors or shivering, stomach cramps, tachycardia, trouble with sleeping, unusual increase in sweating, palpitations, unexplained fever, weakness and yawning.[F4679]', 'DrugBank');

This inhibits the AT1-mediated vasoconstrictive and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II and results in an overall decrease in blood pressure. Candesartan is greater than 10,000 times more selective for AT1 than AT2. Inhibition of aldosterone secretion may increase sodium and water excretion while decreasing potassium excretion.', 'Candesartan cilexetil is an ARB prodrug that is rapidly converted to candesartan, its active metabolite, during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Candesartan confers blood pressure lowering effects by antagonizing the hypertensive effects of angiotensin II via the RAAS. RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. Renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is cleaved by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II increases blood pressure by increasing total peripheral resistance, increasing sodium and water reabsorption in the kidneys via aldosterone secretion, and altering cardiovascular structure. Angiotensin II binds to two receptors: type-1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1) and type-2 angiotensin II receptor (AT2). AT1 is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that mediates the vasoconstrictive and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II. Studies performed in recent years suggest that AT2 antagonizes AT1-mediated effects and directly affects long-term blood pressure control by inducing vasorelaxation and increasing urinary sodium excretion. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are non-peptide competitive inhibitors of AT1. ARBs block the ability of angiotensin II to stimulate pressor and cell proliferative effects. Unlike ACE inhibitors, ARBs do not affect bradykinin-induced vasodilation. The overall effect of ARBs is a decrease in blood pressure.', 'DrugBank');

Lincomycin should be used with caution due to its association with severe cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, and its potential to precipitate _Clostridium difficile_ associated diarrhea (CDAD), which may lead to fatal colitis. Special care should therefore be exercised when used in elderly patients, individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, and those with a history of asthma or significant allergies. Lincomycin for injection may contain benzyl alcohol as a preservative, which has been associated with gasping syndrome in pediatric patients. The serum half-life is extended in patients with hepatic/renal impairment and may require dose adjustments and additional monitoring.

', 'Progesterone binds and activates its nuclear receptor, _PR_, which plays an important part in the signaling of stimuli that maintain the endometrium during its preparation for pregnancy.



Progesterone receptor (PR) is a member of the nuclear/steroid hormone receptor (SHR) family of ligand-dependent transcription factors that is expressed primarily in female reproductive tissue as well as the central nervous system. As a result of its binding its associated steroid hormone, progesterone, the progesterone receptor (PR) modulates the expression of genes that regulate the development, differentiation, and proliferation of target tissues [A175666]. In humans, PR is found to be highly expressed in the stromal (connective tissue) cells during the secretory phase and during pregnancy [A175651]. 



Progesterone may prevent pregnancy by changing the consistency of cervical mucus to be unfavorable for sperm penetration, and by inhibiting follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which normally causes ovulation.  With perfect use, the first-year failure rate for progestin-only oral contraceptives is approximately 0.5%. The typical failure rate, however, is estimated to be approximately 5%, due to late or missed pills [F3904].', 'Progesterone, depending on concentration and dosage form, and timing of exposure may have several pharmacodynamic effects.  These actions, according, to various preparations, are listed below:



General effects



Progesterone is the main hormone of the corpus luteum and the placenta. It acts on the uterus by changing the proliferative phase to the secretory phase of the endometrium (inner mucous lining of the uterus).   This hormone, stimulated by a hormone called _luteinizing hormone_ (LH) is the main hormone during the secretory phase to prepare the corpus luteum and the endometrium for implantation of a fertilized ovum. As the luteal phase concludes, the progesterone hormone sends negative feedback to the anterior pituitary gland in the brain to decrease FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and LH (luteinizing hormone) levels. This prevents ovulation and maturation of oocytes (immature egg cells). The endometrium then prepares for pregnancy by increasing its vascularity (blood vessels) and stimulating mucous secretion. This process occurs by progesterone stimulating the endometrium to decrease endometrial proliferation, leading to a decreased uterine lining thickness, developing more complex uterine glands, collecting energy in the form of glycogen, and providing more uterine blood vessel surface area suitable for supporting a growing embryo. As opposed to cervical mucous changes observed during the proliferative phase and ovulation, progesterone decreases and thickens the cervical mucus, rendering it less elastic. This change occurs because the fertilization time period has passed, and a specific consistency of mucous amenable to sperm entry is no longer required [T490].



**Gelatinized capsules**



Progesterone capsules are an oral dosage form of micronized progesterone which, chemically identical to progesterone of ovarian origin. Progesterone capsules have all the properties of endogenous progesterone with induction of a secretory phase endometrium with gestagenic, antiestrogenic, slightly antiandrogenic and anti-aldosterone effects [F3913]. Progesterone opposes the effects of estrogen on the uterus, and is beneficial in women with unopposed estrogen exposure, which carries an increased risk of malignancy [F3913].





**Vaginal gel and vaginal insert**



 The gel preparation mimics the effects of naturally occurring progesterone. In the presence of adequate levels of estrogen, progesterone converts a proliferative endometrium into secretory endometrium. This means that the endometrium changes from a growing and thickening stage into a subsequent preparation stage for pregnancy, which involves further preparatory changes. Progesterone is necessary for the development of decidual tissue (specialized tissue amenable to supporting a possible pregnancy). Progesterone is required to increase endometrial receptivity for the implantation of a fertilized embryo. Once an embryo is implanted, progesterone helps to maintain the pregnancy [F3898]. 





**Injection (intramuscular)**



 Intramuscularly injected progesterone increases serum progesterone and aids in the prevention of endometrial tissue overgrowth due to unopposed estrogen (which leads to abnormal uterine bleeding and sometimes uterine cancer) [L5638], [F3916]. In the absence or deficiency of progesterone, the endometrium continually proliferates, eventually outgrowing its limited blood supply, shedding incompletely, and leading to abnormal and/or profuse bleeding as well as malignancy [L5638].



**Tablets, contraceptive**



Progesterone-only contraceptive tablets prevent conception by suppressing ovulation in about half of users, causing a thickening of cervical mucus to inhibit sperm movement, lowering the midcycle LH and FSH hormone peaks, slowing the movement of the ovum through the fallopian tubes, and causing secretory changes in the endometrium as described above [F3904].', 'DrugBank');

Esomeprazole is the s-isomer of [DB00338], which is a racemate of the S- and R-enantiomer. Esomeprazole has been shown to inhibit acid secretion to a similar extent as [DB00338], without any significant differences between the two compounds _in vitro_. 



PPIs such as esomeprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]



Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as esomeprazole has been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]', 'DrugBank');

Potassium ions participate in a number of essential physiological processes including the maintenance of intracellular tonicity, the transmission of nerve impulses, the contraction of cardiac, skeletal and smooth muscle, and the maintenance of normal renal function. The intracellular concentration of potassium is approximately 150 to 160 mEq per liter. The normal adult plasma concentration is 3.5 to 5 mEq per liter.

Potassium is a normal dietary constituent and under steady-state conditions the amount of potassium absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract is equal to the amount excreted in the urine. The usual dietary intake of potassium is 50 to 100 mEq per day. Potassium depletion will occur whenever the rate of potassium loss through renal excretion and/or loss from the gastrointestinal tract exceeds the rate of potassium intake. Such depletion usually develops as a consequence of therapy with diuretics, primarily or secondary hyperaldosteronism, diabetic ketoacidosis, or inadequate replacement of potassium in patients on prolonged parenteral nutrition. Depletion can develop rapidly with severe diarrhea, especially if associated with vomiting. Potassium depletion due to these causes is usually accompanied by concomitant loss of chloride and is manifested by hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Potassium depletion may produce weakness, fatigue, disturbances of cardiac rhythm (primarily ectopic beats), prominent U-waves in the electrocardiogram, and, in advanced cases, flaccid paralysis and/or impaired ability to concentrate urine. If potassium depletion associated with metabolic alkalosis cannot be managed by correcting the fundamental cause of the deficiency, e.g., where the patient requires long-term diuretic therapy, supplemental potassium in the form of high potassium food or potassium chloride may be able to restore normal potassium levels. In rare circumstances (e.g., patients with renal tubular acidosis) potassium depletion may be associated with metabolic acidosis and hyperchloremia.

The immunomodulatory actions of lenalidomide can be partly explained by the degradation of IKZF3, since it is a repressor of the interleukin 2 gene (IL2): as lenalidomide decreases the level of IKZF3, the production of IL-2 increases, thereby increasing the proliferation of natural killer (NK), NKT cells, and CD4+ T cells.[A228703] Lenalidomide inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-12, while elevating the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.[A228543] Lenalidomide acts as a T-cell co-stimulatory molecule that promotes CD3 T-cell proliferation and increases the production of IL-2 and IFN-γ in T lymphocytes, which enhances NK cell cytotoxicity and ADCC. It inhibits the expression and function of T-regulatory cells, which are often overabundant in some hematological malignancies.[A228708] 



Lenalidomide directly exerts antitumour effects by inhibiting the proliferation and inducing apoptosis of tumour cells. Lenalidomide triggers the activation of pro-apoptotic caspase-8, enhances tumour cell sensitivity to FAS-induced apoptosis, and downregulates NF-κB, an anti-apoptotic protein.[A228708] Independent of its immunomodulatory effects, lenalidomide mediates anti-angiogenic effects by inhibiting angiogenic growth factors released by tumour cells, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblastic-growth factor (BFGF), and hepatocyte-growth factor. _In vitro_, lenalidomide inhibits cell adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1, LFA-1, β2 and β3 integrins, as well as gap-junction function, thereby preventing metastasis of malignant cells.[A228708] ', 'In hematological malignancies, the immune system is deregulated in the form of altered cytokine networks in the tumour microenvironment, defective T cell regulation of host-tumour immune interactions, and diminished NK cell activity.[A228543] Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent with antineoplastic, antiangiogenic, and anti-inflammatory properties.[A228628] Lenalidomide exerts direct cytotoxicity by increasing apoptosis and inhibiting the proliferation of hematopoietic malignant cells.[A228708] It delays tumour growth in nonclinical hematopoietic tumour models _in vivo_, including multiple myeloma.[L16028] Lenalidomide also works to limit the invasion or metastasis of tumour cells and inhibits angiogenesis.[A228708]



Lenalidomide also mediates indirect antitumour effects via its immunomodulatory actions: it inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are implicated in various hematologic malignancies. Lenalidomide enhances the host immunity by stimulating T cell proliferation and enhancing the activity of natural killer (NK) cells.[A713, A228703, A228708] Lenalidomide is about 100–1000 times more potent in stimulating T cell proliferation than [thalidomide].[A228543] _In vitro_, it enhances antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), which is even more pronounced when used in combination with rituximab.[L16028] Due to its anti-inflammatory properties, lenalidomide has been investigated in the context of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[A229418] ', 'DrugBank');

A deficiency in iron indicates that the body cannot produce enough normal red blood cells.[A32514,L11800] Iron deficiency anemia occurs when body stores of iron decrease to very low levels, and the stored iron is insufficient to support normal red blood cell (RBC) production. Insufficient dietary iron, impaired iron absorption, bleeding, pregnancy, or loss of iron through the urine can lead to iron deficiency.[A32514,L11794]  Symptoms of iron deficiency anemia include fatigue, breathlessness, palpitations, dizziness, and headache.



Taking iron in supplement form, such as ferrous sulfate, allows for more rapid increases in iron levels when dietary supply and stores are not sufficient.[L2175] Iron is transported by the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) across the endolysosomal membrane to enter the macrophage. It can then can be incorporated into ferritin and be stored in the macrophage or carried of the macrophage by ferroportin. This exported iron is  oxidized by the enzyme to ceruloplasmin to Fe3+, followed by sequestration by transferrin for transport in the serum to various sites, including the bone marrow for hemoglobin synthesis or into the liver.[A32524] Iron combines with porphyrin and globin chains to form hemoglobin, which is critical for oxygen delivery from the lungs to other tissues.[L2263]', 'Ferrous sulfate replenishes iron, an essential component in hemoglobin, myoglobin, and various enzymes.

Regarding TNF-alpha, thalidomide seems to block this mediator via a variety of mechanism. Thalidomide can inhibit the expression myeloid differentiating factor 88 (MyD88), an adaptor protein that is involved in the TNF-alpha production signalling pathway, at the protein and RNA level. Additionally, thalidomide prevents the activation of Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF-kB), another upstream effector of the TNF-alpha production pathway. Finally, some evidences suggest that thalidomide can block alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AGP), a known inducer of the NF-kB/MyD88 pathway, thus inhibiting the expression of TNF-alpha [A246195]. The down-regulation of NF-kB and MyD88 can also affect the cross talk between the NF-kB/MyD88 and VEGF pathway, resulting in thalidomide''s anti-angiogenic effect. [A246200]', 'Thalidomide, originally developed as a sedative, is an immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory agent with a spectrum of activity that is not fully characterized. However, thalidomide is believed to exert its effect through inhibiting and modulating the level of various inflammatory mediators, particularly tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) and IL-6. [A714] Additionally, thalidomide is also shown to inhibit basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), suggesting a potential anti-angiogenic application of thalidomide in cancer patients.

Action on the external urinary sphincter is mediated via duloxetine''s CNS effects. Increased serotonin and norepinephrine concentrations in Onuf''s nucleus leads to increased activation of 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, and α<sub>1</sub> adrenergic receptors.[A178663,A178666] 5-HT<sub>2</sub> and α<sub>1</sub> are both G<sub>q</sub> coupled and their activation increases the activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C (IP<sub>3</sub>/PLC) pathway.[T116] This pathway leads to release of intracellular calcium stores, increasing intracellular calcium concentrations, and facilitating neuronal excitability. 5-HT<sub>3</sub> functions as a ligand-gated sodium channel which allows sodium to flow into the neuron when activated. Increased flow of sodium into the neuron contributes to depolarization and activation of voltage gated channels involved in action potential generation. The combined action of these three receptors contributes to increased excitability of the pudendal motor nerve in response to glutamate.



Also related to duloxetine''s action at the spinal cord is its modulation of pain. Increasing the concentration of serotonin and norepinephrine in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord increases descending inhibition of pain through activation of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic, and α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors.[A178705] 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, and α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic mediate neuronal activation as described above. The activated neuron in this case is the GABAergic inhibitory interneuron which synapses onto the nociceptive projection neuron to inhibit the transmission of painful stimuli to the brain. The 5-HT<sub>1</sub> and α<sub>2</sub> receptors are G<sub>i</sub>/G<sub>o</sub> coupled and their activation leads to increased potassium current through inward rectifier channels and decreased adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A signaling which contributes to neuronal inhibition.[A178705,T116] These inhibitory receptors are present on the projection neuron itself as well as the dorsal root ganglion which precedes it and serves to directly suppress the transmission of painful stimuli.



The mechanisms involved in duloxetine''s benefits in depression and anxiety have not been fully elucidated. Dysfunctional serotonin and norepinephrine signaling are thought to be involved and increases in the availability of these neurotransmitters at the synaptic cleft thought to mediate a therapeutic effect.[A178666] It is postulated that the involvement of serotonin and norepinephrine in area responsible for emotional modulation such as the limbic system contributes to the effects in mood disorders specifically but this has yet to be confirmed.



Duloxetine''s hypertensive effect is related to its intended pharmacological effect. Increased availability of norepinephrine leads to activation of adrenergic receptors on the vascular endothelium. Since the action of α<sub>1</sub> receptors predominates, vasoconstriction results as the G<sub>q</sub> coupled receptor mediates calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum to facilitate smooth muscle contraction.[T116]', 'Duloxetine, through increasing serotonin and norepinephrine concentrations in Onuf''s nucleus, enhances glutamatergic activation of the pudendal motor nerve which innervates the external urethral sphinter.[A178663,A178666] This enhanced signaling allows for stronger contraction. Increased contraction of this sphincter increases the pressure needed to produce an incontinence episode in stress urinary incontinence. Duloxetine has been shown to improve Patient Global Impression of Improvement and Incontinence Quality of Life scores.[A178669] It has also been shown to reduce the median incontinence episode frequency at doses of 40 and 80 mg.



Action at the dorsal horn of the spinal cord allows duloxetine to strengthen the the serotonergic and adrenergic pathways involved in descending inhibition of pain.[A178666,A178705] This results in an increased threshold of activation necessary to transmit painful stimuli to the brain and effective relief of pain, particularly in neuropathic pain. Pain relief has been noted in a variety of painful conditions including diabetic peripheral neuropathy, fibromyalgia, and osteoarthritis using a range of pain assessment surveys.[A178711]



While duloxetine has been shown to be effective in both animal models of mood disorders and in clinical trials for the treatment of these disorders in humans, the broad scope of its pharmacodynamic effects on mood regulation in the brain has yet to be explained.[A178714]



Increased blood pressure is a common side effect with duloxetine due to vasoconstriction mediated by the intended increase in norepinephrine signaling.[label,T116]', 'DrugBank');

Candesartan confers blood pressure lowering effects by antagonizing the hypertensive effects of angiotensin II via the RAAS. RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. Renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is cleaved by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II increases blood pressure by increasing total peripheral resistance, increasing sodium and water reabsorption in the kidneys via aldosterone secretion, and altering cardiovascular structure. Angiotensin II binds to two receptors: type-1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1) and type-2 angiotensin II receptor (AT2). AT1 is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that mediates the vasoconstrictive and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II. Studies performed in recent years suggest that AT2 antagonizes AT1-mediated effects and directly affects long-term blood pressure control by inducing vasorelaxation and increasing urinary sodium excretion. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are non-peptide competitive inhibitors of AT1. ARBs block the ability of angiotensin II to stimulate pressor and cell proliferative effects. Unlike ACE inhibitors, ARBs do not affect bradykinin-induced vasodilation. The overall effect of ARBs is a decrease in blood pressure.', 'DrugBank');

', '**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].



Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].



In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].



There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].



Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].



The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. 



In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].



In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway.

The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].', 'Zinc is involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of human proteins may bind zinc, in addition to hundreds of proteins that transport and traffic zinc. It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is an essential element for a proper sense of taste and smell and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations [L2211].



Studies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions [L2095]:



**Colds:** Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently [L2095].



**Wound healing:** Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements [L2095]. 



**Diahrrea**: Oral zinc supplements can reduce the symptoms of diarrhea in children with low levels of zinc, especially in cases of malnutrition [L2095].

Signaling through the histamine H1 receptor is thought to primarily promote the activation of inflammatory reactions, such as allergy, asthma, and autoimmune diseases.[A179731] H1 receptor signaling activates the intracellular transcription factors, such as IP3, PLC, PKC, DAG, and intracellular calcium ions, which all work to activate further downstream cascades. Activated downstream cascades lead to the production of cytokines, the release of mast cell inflammatory mediators, synthesis of prostacyclins, activation of platelet factor, as well as the synthesis of nitric oxide, arachidonic acid, and thromboxane, which all contribute to inflammatory reactions.[A179731] 



Olopatadine is an anti-allergic molecule that works via several mechanisms. As a mast cell stabilizer, it stabilizes rodent basophils and human conjunctival mast cells and inhibits the immunologically-stimulated release of histamine.[A179704] Olopatadine acts as an antagonist at the histamine H1 receptors with high selectivity, which is explained by a unique receptor binding pocket that consists of the aspartate residue in the third transmembrane helix and other sites in the H1 receptor.[A1170] Upon binding, olopatadine blocks the H1 receptor signaling pathway, inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators, such as tryptase, prostaglandin D2, TNF-alpha, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines.[L6790] It also decreases chemotaxis and inhibits eosinophil activation.[L6781] _In vitro_, olopatadine was shown to inhibit epithelial cell intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), which promotes the recruitment of migrating pro-inflammatory mediators.[A179704]', 'Inflammatory reactions in response to various stimuli are mediated by endogenous mediators and other pro-inflammatory factors.

The risk of cardiovascular events in diabetes type 2 is increased due to the damaging effects of diabetes on blood vessels and nerves in the cardiovascular system.

A deficiency in iron indicates that the body cannot produce enough normal red blood cells.[A32514,L11800] Iron deficiency anemia occurs when body stores of iron decrease to very low levels, and the stored iron is insufficient to support normal red blood cell (RBC) production. Insufficient dietary iron, impaired iron absorption, bleeding, pregnancy, or loss of iron through the urine can lead to iron deficiency.[A32514,L11794]  Symptoms of iron deficiency anemia include fatigue, breathlessness, palpitations, dizziness, and headache.



Taking iron in supplement form, such as ferrous sulfate, allows for more rapid increases in iron levels when dietary supply and stores are not sufficient.[L2175] Iron is transported by the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) across the endolysosomal membrane to enter the macrophage. It can then can be incorporated into ferritin and be stored in the macrophage or carried of the macrophage by ferroportin.

The hetero-octomeric complex of the channel is composed of four pore-forming Kir6.2 subunits and four regulatory sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) subunits. Alternative splicing allows the formation of channels composed of varying subunit isoforms expressed at different concentrations in different tissues.[A177730] In pancreatic beta cells, ATP-sensitive potassium channels play a role as essential metabolic sensors and regulators that couple membrane excitability with glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS).[A177727] When there is a decrease in the ATP:ADP ratio, the channels are activated and open, leading to K+ efflux from the cell, membrane hyperpolarization, and suppression of insulin secretion.[A177727] In contrast, increased uptake of glucose into the cell leads to elevated intracellular ATP:ADP ratio, leading to the closure of channels and membrane depolarization. Depolarization leads to activation and opening of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and consequently an influx of calcium ions into the cell.[A177727] Elevated intracellular calcium levels causes the contraction of the filaments of actomyosin responsible for the exocytosis of insulin granules stored in vesicles.[A177715] Glimepiride blocks the ATP-sensitive potassium channel by binding non-specifically to the B sites of both sulfonylurea receptor-1 (SUR1) and sulfonylurea receptor-2A (SUR2A) subunits as well as the A site of SUR1 subunit of the channel to promote insulin secretion from the beta cell.[A177715] ', 'Glimepiride stimulates the secretion of insulin granules from the pancreatic beta cells and improves the sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin to increase peripheral glucose uptake, thus reducing plasma blood glucose levels and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels.

The Health Canada monograph for rosuvastatin further specifies that rosuvastatin is indicated for the reduction of elevated total cholesterol (Total-C), LDL-C, ApoB, the Total-C/HDL-C ratio and triglycerides (TG) and for increasing HDL-C in hyperlipidemic and dyslipidemic conditions when response to diet and exercise alone has been inadequate. It is also indicated for the prevention of major cardiovascular events (including risk of myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and coronary artery revascularization) in adult patients without documented history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events, but with at least two conventional risk factors for cardiovascular disease.[F4652]



Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]', 'Rosuvastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A181421] Rosuvastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which increases hepatic uptake of LDL. Rosuvastatin also inhibits hepatic synthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL).[F4649] The overall effect is a decrease in plasma LDL and VLDL. 



In vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that rosuvastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] This includes improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response.



Statins have also been found to bind allosterically to β2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and in T cell activation.[A181559]



Rosuvastatin exerts an anti-inflammatory effect on rat mesenteric microvascular endothelium by attenuating leukocyte rolling, adherence and transmigration.[A1807] The drug also modulates nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression and reduces ischemic-reperfusion injuries in rat hearts.[A1787] Rosuvastatin increases the bioavailability of nitric oxide[A1807,A1799,A1787] by upregulating NOS[A1791] and by increasing the stability of NOS through post-transcriptional polyadenylation.[A1796] It is unclear as to how rosuvastatin brings about these effects though they may be due to decreased concentrations of mevalonic acid.', 'Rosuvastatin is a synthetic, enantiomerically pure antilipemic agent. It is used to lower total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and trigleride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, rosuvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A181087, A181406]



Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]



**Skeletal Muscle Effects**



Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. These risks can occur at any dose level, but are increased at the highest dose (40 mg). Rosuvastatin should be prescribed with caution in patients with predisposing factors for myopathy (e.g., age ≥ 65 years, inadequately treated hypothyroidism, renal impairment).



The risk of myopathy during treatment with rosuvastatin may be increased with concurrent administration of some other lipid-lowering therapies (such as [fenofibrate] or [niacin]), [gemfibrozil], [cyclosporine], [atazanavir]/[ritonavir], [lopinavir]/ritonavir, or [simeprevir].  Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin, coadministered with [colchicine], and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together.[F4649] 



Real-world data from observational studies has suggested that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]



**Liver Enzyme Abnormalities**



Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. In most cases, the elevations were transient and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. There were two cases of jaundice, for which a relationship to rosuvastatin therapy could not be determined, which resolved after discontinuation of therapy. There were no cases of liver failure or irreversible liver disease in these trials.[F4649]



**Endocrine Effects**



Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin calcium tablets. Based on clinical trial data with rosuvastatin, in some instances these increases may exceed the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.[F4649]



An in vitro study found that [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], and [pitavastatin] exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on human pancreas islet β cells, with reductions in cell viability of 32, 41, 34 and 29%, respectively, versus control]. Moreover, insulin secretion rates were decreased by 34, 30, 27 and 19%, respectively, relative to control.[A182012]



HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and lower cholesterol levels and, as such, might theoretically blunt adrenal or gonadal steroid hormone production. Rosuvastatin demonstrated no effect upon nonstimulated cortisol levels and no effect on thyroid metabolism as assessed by TSH plasma concentration. In rosuvastatin treated patients, there was no impairment of adrenocortical reserve and no reduction in plasma cortisol concentrations. Clinical studies with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have suggested that these agents do not reduce plasma testosterone concentration. The effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on male fertility have not been studied. The effects, if any, on the pituitarygonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown.[F4652]



**Cardiovascular**



Ubiquinone levels were not measured in rosuvastatin clinical trials, however significant decreases in circulating ubiquinone levels in patients treated with other statins have been observed. The clinical significance of a potential long-term statin-induced deficiency of ubiquinone has not been established. It has been reported that a decrease in myocardial ubiquinone levels could lead to impaired cardiac function in patients with borderline congestive heart failure.[F4652]



**Lipoprotein A**



In some patients, the beneficial effect of lowered total cholesterol and LDL-C levels may be partly blunted by a concomitant increase in the Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentrations. Present knowledge suggests the importance of high Lp(a) levels as an emerging risk factor for coronary heart disease. It is thus desirable to maintain and reinforce lifestyle changes in high-risk patients placed on rosuvastatin therapy.[F4652] Further studies have demonstrated statins affect Lp(a) levels differently in patients with dyslipidemia depending on their apo(a) phenotype; statins increase Lp(a) levels exclusively in patients with the low molecular weight apo(a) phenotype.[A181418]', 'DrugBank');

', '**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].



Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].



In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].



There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].



Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].



The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. 



In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].



In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].



The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].', 'Zinc is involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of human proteins may bind zinc, in addition to hundreds of proteins that transport and traffic zinc. It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is an essential element for a proper sense of taste and smell and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations [L2211].



Studies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions [L2095]:



**Colds:** Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently [L2095].



**Wound healing:** Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements [L2095]. 



**Diahrrea**: Oral zinc supplements can reduce the symptoms of diarrhea in children with low levels of zinc, especially in cases of malnutrition [L2095].

Intravenous indometacin is indicated to induce closure of a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants weighing between 500 and 1750 g when after 48 hours usual medical management (e.g., fluid restriction, diuretics, digitalis, respiratory support, etc.) is ineffective.[L10553]', 'Indometacin is a nonspecific and reversible inhibitor of the cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzyme or prostaglandin G/H synthase. There are two identified isoforms of COX: COX-1 is universally present in most body tissues and is involved in the synthesis of the prostaglandins and thromboxane A2, while COX-2 is expressed in response to injury or inflammation.[A177871] Constitutively expressed, the COX-1 enzyme is involved in gastric mucosal protection, platelet, and kidney function by catalyzing the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin (PG) G2 and PGG2 to PGH2.[A177871] COX-2 is constitutively expressed and highly inducible by inflammatory stimuli. It is found in the central nervous system, kidneys, uterus, and other organs. COX-2 also catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to PGG2 and PGG2 to PGH2. In the COX-2-mediated pathway, PGH2 is further converted to PGE2 and PGI2 (also known as prostacyclin). PGE2 is involved in mediating inflammation, pain, and fever. Decreasing levels of PGE2 leads to reduced inflammatory reactions. Indometacin is known to inhibit both isoforms of COX, however, with greater selectivity for COX-1, which accounts for its increased adverse gastric effects relative to other NSAIDs. It binds to the enzyme''s active site and prevents the interaction between the enzyme and its substrate, arachidonic acid. Indometacin, unlike other NSAIDs, also inhibits phospholipase A2, the enzyme responsible for releasing arachidonic acid from phospholipids. The analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects of indomethacin as well as adverse reactions associated with the drug occur as a result of decreased prostaglandin synthesis. Its antipyretic effects may be due to action on the hypothalamus, resulting in increased peripheral blood flow, vasodilation, and subsequent heat dissipation.



The exact mechanism of action of indometacin in inducing closure of a patent ductus arteriosus is not fully understood; however, it is thought to be through inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.[L6778] At birth, the ductus arteriosus is normally closed as the tension of the oxygen increases significantly after birth.[A177880] Patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants is associated with congenital heart malformations where PGE1 mediates an opposite effect to that of oxygen. PGE1 dilates the ductus arteriosus through smooth muscle relaxation and prevents the closure of the ductus arteriosus.[A177880] By inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins, indometacin promotes the closure of ductus arteriosus.[L10553]



Indometacin has been described as possessing anticancer and antiviral properties through activation of protein kinase R (PKR) and downstream phosphorylation of eIF2α, inhibiting protein synthesis.[A234429, A234434]', 'Indometacin is an NSAID with analgesic and antipyretic properties that exerts its pharmacological effects by inhibiting the synthesis of factors involved in pain, fever, and inflammation. Its therapeutic action does not involve pituitary-adrenal stimulation.[L6778] Indometacin primarily works by suppressing inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis by providing relief of pain as well as reducing fever, swelling, and tenderness. This effectiveness has been demonstrated by a reduction in the extent of joint swelling, the average number of joints displaying symptoms of inflammation, and the severity of morning stiffness. Increased mobility was demonstrated by a decrease in total walking time and by improved functional capability seen as an increase in grip strength.[L6778] In clinical trials, indometacin was shown to be effective in relieving the pain, reducing the fever, swelling, redness, and tenderness of acute gouty arthritis. Due to its pharmacological actions, the use of indometacin is associated with the risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, as well as gastrointestinal effects such as bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines.[L6778]



In a study of healthy individuals, acute oral and intravenous indometacin therapy resulted in a transiently diminished basal and CO2 stimulated cerebral blood flow; this effect disappeared in one study after one week of oral treatment.[L6778] The clinical significance of this effect has not been established. Compared to other NSAIDs, it is suggested that indometacin is a more potent vasoconstrictor that is more consistent in decreasing cerebral blood flow and inhibiting CO2 reactivity.[A177871] There have been studies that show indometacin directly inhibiting neuronal activity to some extent in the trigeminocervical complex after either superior salivatory nucleus or dural stimulation.[A177871]', 'DrugBank');

[L39095] Patients may experience ED due to a variety of causes including psychogenic, neurogenic, vasculogenic, iatrogenic, or endocrine. [A242392] These causes result in dysfunction of penile smooth muscle relaxation through either disrupted neuronal signaling or direct influence on smooth muscle cells. During sexual arousal, non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) neurons release nitric oxide (NO). Nitric oxide stimulates guanylate cyclase which converts guanosine triphosphate to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).[A242287, A242377] cGMP activates the cGMP-dependent kinase (PKG) in a signal cascade which activates K+ channels leading to inhibition of Ca2+ channels, inhibits platelet activation, and inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation while inducing apoptosis. This signal cascade is attenuated by PDE5 which breaks the phosphodiester bond of cGMP, converting it to GMP. Inhibition of PDE5 by tadalafil increases signaling via the PKG cascade which supports penile smooth muscle relaxation during sexual arousal by decreasing Ca2+ entry into smooth muscle cells. This smooth muscle relaxation allows blood to fill the corpus cavernosum thereby producing an erection.



In PAH, blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries is raised due to a variety of mechanisms stemming from endothelial dysfunction.[A242377] Decreased production of NO and prostacyclin reduce vasodilatory signaling while overproduction of endothelin-1 and thromboxane increase vasoconstriction. Inflammation, thromboses, and hypoxia later contribute to vascular remodeling which further reduces luminal size. The resultant increase in blood pressure reduces the capacity for gas exchange and increases afterload at the right ventricle, producing symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and dizziness as well as leading to right-sided heart failure. Tadalafil exerts its therapeutic effect in PAH through boosting NO-cGMP signaling to contribute to smooth muscle relaxation as with ED.



Lastly, tadalafil is used to treat BPH.[L39095] BPH produces urinary dysfunction through hyperproliferation of the epithelial and smooth muscle layers of the prostate.[A242382] The increased size of the prostate blocks urine flow through the urethra resulting in higher residual volumes due to incomplete emptying. Tadalafil does not appear to exert its benefit via smooth muscle relaxation of the prostate. It may instead exert its effect through a mix of increased oxygenation and decreased inflammation, which decreases tissue remodeling, and inhibition of cell proliferation through the cGMP cascade.



The decreased affinity for PDE6 compared to other PDE5 inhibitors may explain the decreased incidence of visual side effects as PDE6 is present in the eye and contributes to color vision.[L39100, L39105, A242287]', 'Tadalafil exerts a therapeutic effect in ED by increasing sexual stimulation-dependant smooth muscle relaxation in the penis, allowing the corpus cavernosum to fill with blood to produce an erection.[A242287, A242377] Smooth muscle relaxation in the pulmonary vasculature helps to produce vasodilation in PAH which reduces blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries.[A242377] In BPH, tadalafil may contribute to decreased smooth muscle cell proliferation which may reduce the size of the prostate and relieve the anatomical obstruction which produces urinary symptoms of BPH.[A242382] The decreased affinity of tadalafil for PDE6 compared to other PDE5 inhibitors may explain the reduced incidence of visual side effects.[L39100, L39105, A242287]', 'DrugBank');

The endogenous VDR activator, calcitriol [1,25(OH)2 D3], is a hormone that binds to VDRs that are present in the parathyroid gland, intestine, kidney, and bone to maintain parathyroid function and calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, and to VDRs found in many other tissues, including prostate, endothelium and immune cells. VDR activation is essential for the proper formation and maintenance of normal bone. In the diseased kidney, the activation of vitamin D is diminished, resulting in a rise of PTH, subsequently leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism and disturbances in the calcium and phosphorus homeostasis.1 Decreased levels of 1,25(OH)2 D3 have been observed in early stages of chronic kidney disease. The decreased levels of 1,25(OH)2 D3 and resultant elevated PTH levels, both of which often precede abnormalities in serum calcium and phosphorus, affect bone turnover rate and may result in renal osteodystrophy. An in vitro study indicates that paricalcitol is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A at concentrations up to 50 nM (21 ng/mL).', 'DrugBank');

', '**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].



Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].



In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].



There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].



Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].



The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. 



In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].



In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].



The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].', 'Zinc is involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of human proteins may bind zinc, in addition to hundreds of proteins that transport and traffic zinc. It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is an essential element for a proper sense of taste and smell and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations [L2211].



Studies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions [L2095]:



**Colds:** Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently [L2095].



**Wound healing:** Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements [L2095]. 



**Diahrrea**: Oral zinc supplements can reduce the symptoms of diarrhea in children with low levels of zinc, especially in cases of malnutrition [L2095].

After uptake into malignant cells, gemcitabine is phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase to form gemcitabine monophosphate, which is then converted to the active compounds, gemcitabine diphosphate (dFdCDP) and gemcitabine triphosphate (dFdCTP). These active metabolites are nucleosides that mediate antitumour effects. dFdCTP competes with deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) for incorporation into DNA, thereby competitively inhibiting DNA chain elongation. The non-terminal position of dFdCTP in the DNA chain prevents detection of dFdCTP in the chain and repair by proof-reading 3′5′-exonuclease: this process is referred to as "masked DNA chain termination."

Gemcitabine has self-potentiating pharmacological actions that can increase the probability of successful incorporation of gemcitabine triphosphate into the DNA chain: dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, an enzyme responsible for catalyzing the reactions that generate dCTP for DNA synthesis.

[L39095] Patients may experience ED due to a variety of causes including psychogenic, neurogenic, vasculogenic, iatrogenic, or endocrine. [A242392] These causes result in dysfunction of penile smooth muscle relaxation through either disrupted neuronal signaling or direct influence on smooth muscle cells. During sexual arousal, non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) neurons release nitric oxide (NO). Nitric oxide stimulates guanylate cyclase which converts guanosine triphosphate to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).[A242287, A242377] cGMP activates the cGMP-dependent kinase (PKG) in a signal cascade which activates K+ channels leading to inhibition of Ca2+ channels, inhibits platelet activation, and inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation while inducing apoptosis. This signal cascade is attenuated by PDE5 which breaks the phosphodiester bond of cGMP, converting it to GMP. Inhibition of PDE5 by tadalafil increases signaling via the PKG cascade which supports penile smooth muscle relaxation during sexual arousal by decreasing Ca2+ entry into smooth muscle cells. This smooth muscle relaxation allows blood to fill the corpus cavernosum thereby producing an erection.



In PAH, blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries is raised due to a variety of mechanisms stemming from endothelial dysfunction.[A242377] Decreased production of NO and prostacyclin reduce vasodilatory signaling while overproduction of endothelin-1 and thromboxane increase vasoconstriction. Inflammation, thromboses, and hypoxia later contribute to vascular remodeling which further reduces luminal size. The resultant increase in blood pressure reduces the capacity for gas exchange and increases afterload at the right ventricle, producing symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and dizziness as well as leading to right-sided heart failure. Tadalafil exerts its therapeutic effect in PAH through boosting NO-cGMP signaling to contribute to smooth muscle relaxation as with ED.



Lastly, tadalafil is used to treat BPH.[L39095] BPH produces urinary dysfunction through hyperproliferation of the epithelial and smooth muscle layers of the prostate.[A242382] The increased size of the prostate blocks urine flow through the urethra resulting in higher residual volumes due to incomplete emptying. Tadalafil does not appear to exert its benefit via smooth muscle relaxation of the prostate. It may instead exert its effect through a mix of increased oxygenation and decreased inflammation, which decreases tissue remodeling, and inhibition of cell proliferation through the cGMP cascade.

ARBs selectively bind to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) and prevent the protein angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects. As the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, Angiotensin II causes vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis.[F4709] Overall, olmesartan''s physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium. 



Olmesartan also effects on the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an important role in hemostasis and regulation of kidney, vascular, and cardiac functions. Pharmacological blockade of RAAS via  AT1 receptor blockade inhibits negative regulatory feedback within RAAS, which is a contributing factor to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal disease. In particular, heart failure is associated with chronic activation of RAAS, leading to inappropriate fluid retention, vasoconstriction, and ultimately a further decline in left ventricular function. ARBs have been shown to have a protective effect on the heart by improving cardiac function, reducing afterload, increasing cardiac output and preventing ventricular hypertrophy and remodelling.[A174154] ', 'Overall, olmesartan''s physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium. 





**Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients**



In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, such as volume-and/or salt-depleted patients (e.g., those being treated with high doses of diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may be anticipated after initiation of treatment with olmesartan. Initiate treatment under close medical supervision. If hypotension does occur, place the patient in the supine position and, if necessary, give an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized.[F4709,F4712]



Valvular Stenosis: there is concern on theoretical grounds that patients with aortic stenosis might be at a particular risk of decreased coronary perfusion, because they do not develop as much afterload reduction.[F4712]





**Impaired Renal Function**



As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with olmesartan. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and rarely with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with olmesartan.



In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) have been reported. There has been no long-term use of olmesartan medoxomil in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but similar results may be expected.[F4709,F4712]





**Sprue-like Enteropathy**



Severe, chronic diarrhea with substantial weight loss has been reported in patients taking olmesartan months to years after drug initiation. Intestinal biopsies of patients often demonstrated villous atrophy. If a patient develops these symptoms during treatment with olmesartan, exclude other etiologies. Consider discontinuation of olmesartan medoxomil in cases where no other etiology is identified.[F4709,F4712]





**Electrolyte Imbalances**

It has been hypothesized that obsessive-compulsive disorder, like depression, is also caused by the disregulation of serotonin.[A187165]

Risperidone is additionally indicated in Canada for the short-term symptomatic management of aggression or psychotic symptoms in patients with severe dementia of the Alzheimer type unresponsive to nonpharmacological approaches.[L12906]



Risperidone is also used off-label for a number of conditions including as an adjunct to antidepressants in treatment-resistant depression.[A177226]', 'Though its precise mechanism of action is not fully understood, current focus is on the ability of risperidone to inhibit the D2 dopaminergic receptors and 5-HT2A serotonergic receptors in the brain. Schizophrenia is thought to result from an excess of dopaminergic D2 and serotonergic 5-HT2A activity, resulting in overactivity of central mesolimbic pathways and mesocortical pathways, respectively.[A1115, A1116, A1117]



D2 dopaminergic receptors are transiently inhibited by risperidone, reducing dopaminergic neurotransmission, therefore decreasing positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as delusions and hallucinations.[A251765] Risperidone binds transiently and with loose affinity to the dopaminergic D2 receptor, with an ideal receptor occupancy of 60-70% for optimal effect.[A1119,A31773] Rapid dissociation of risperidone from the D2 receptors contributes to decreased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), which occur with permanent and high occupancy blockade of D2 dopaminergic receptors.[A1118,A1119] Low-affinity binding and rapid dissociation from the D2 receptor distinguish risperidone from the traditional antipsychotic drugs. A higher occupancy rate of D2 receptors is said to increase the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms and is therefore to be avoided.[A1118,A1119,A31771] 

 

Increased serotonergic mesocortical activity in schizophrenia results in negative symptoms, such as depression and decreased motivation. The high-affinity binding of risperidone to 5-HT2A receptors leads to a decrease in serotonergic activity. In addition, 5-HT2A receptor blockade results in decreased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms, likely by increasing dopamine release from the frontal cortex, and not the nigrostriatal tract. Dopamine level is therefore not completely inhibited.[A1117,A1119] Through the above mechanisms, both serotonergic and D2 blockade by risperidone are thought to synergistically work to decrease the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms. 

 

Risperidone has also been said to be an antagonist of alpha-1 (α1), alpha-2 (α2), and histamine (H1) receptors.[A37034] Blockade of these receptors is thought to improve symptoms of schizophrenia, however the exact mechanism of action on these receptors is not fully understood at this time.[L12885]', 'The primary action of risperidone is to decrease dopaminergic and serotonergic pathway activity in the brain, therefore decreasing symptoms of schizophrenia and mood disorders.[A1115,A1116]



Risperidone has a high binding affinity for serotonergic 5-HT2A receptors when compared to dopaminergic D2 receptors in the brain.[A1114,A1115] Risperidone binds to D2 receptors with a lower affinity than first-generation antipsychotic drugs, which bind with very high affinity. A reduction in extrapyramidal symptoms with risperidone, when compared to its predecessors, is likely a result of its moderate affinity for dopaminergic D2 receptors.[A1119,A1117]', 'DrugBank');

Indicated for the long-term treatment of the above conditions.[F3202]', 'Hydrochloric acid (HCl) secretion into the gastric lumen is a process regulated mainly by the H(+)/K(+)-ATPase of the proton pump, expressed in high quantities by the parietal cells of the stomach.[A174295] ATPase is an enzyme on the parietal cell membrane that facilitates hydrogen and potassium exchange through the cell, which normally results in the extrusion of potassium and formation of HCl (gastric acid). 



Proton pump inhibitors such as pantoprazole are substituted _benzimidazole_ derivatives, weak bases, which accumulate in the acidic space of the parietal cell before being converted in the _canaliculi_  (small canal) of the gastric parietal cell, an acidic environment, to active _sulfenamide_ derivatives. This active form then makes disulfide bonds with important cysteines on the gastric acid pump, inhibiting its function.[A174247] Specifically, pantoprazole binds to the _sulfhydryl group_ of H+, K+-ATPase, which is an enzyme implicated in accelerating the final step in the acid secretion pathway. The enzyme is inactivated, inhibiting gastric acid secretion.[A174253] The inhibition of gastric acid secretion is stronger with proton pump inhibitors such as pantoprazole and lasts longer than with the H(2) antagonists.[A174295] ', 'This drug acts to decrease gastric acid secretion, which reduces stomach acidity. Pantoprazole administration leads to long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion.[F3193]



**General Effects**



Pantoprazole has been shown to reduce acid reflux-related symptoms, heal inflammation of the esophagus, and improve patient quality of life more effectively than histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2 blockers). This drug has an excellent safety profile and a low incidence of drug interactions. It can be used safely in various high-risk patient populations, including the elderly and those with renal failure or moderate hepatic dysfunction.[A174226]



Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as pantoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]



PPIs such as pantoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes [A177577, A177580]. 



**A note on laboratory testing abnormalities**



During treatment with antisecretory medicinal products such as pantoprazole, serum gastrin (a peptide hormone that stimulates secretion of gastric acid) increases in response to the decreased acid secretion caused by proton pump inhibition. The increased gastrin level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumors.

This binding results in displacement of divalent cations and increased membrane permeability, allowing for aminoglycoside entry.[A232294, A232304, A232309, A232314]

The second “energy-dependent phase I” of aminoglycoside entry into the cytoplasm relies on the proton-motive force and allows a limited amount of aminoglycoside access to its primary intracellular target - the bacterial 30S ribosome.[A232294, A232314] This ultimately results in the mistranslation of proteins and disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane.[A233320] Finally, in the “energy-dependent phase II” stage, concentration-dependent bacterial killing is observed. Aminoglycoside rapidly accumulates in the cell due to the damaged cytoplasmic membrane, and protein mistranslation and synthesis inhibition is amplified.[A232294, A232314, A232319] The necessity of oxygen-dependent active transport explains why aminoglycosides are ineffective against anaerobic bacteria.[A234130]

Hence, aminoglycosides have both immediate bactericidal effects through membrane disruption and delayed bactericidal effects through impaired protein synthesis; observed experimental data and mathematical modeling support this two-mechanism model.[A232294, A232299]

Inhibition of protein synthesis is a key component of aminoglycoside efficacy. Structural and cell biological studies suggest that aminoglycosides bind to the 16S rRNA in helix 44 (h44), near the A site of the 30S ribosomal subunit, altering interactions between h44 and h45. This binding also displaces two important residues, A1492 and A1493, from h44, mimicking normal conformational changes that occur with successful codon-anticodon pairing in the A site.[A232324, A232329] Overall, aminoglycoside binding has several negative effects including inhibition of translation, initiation, elongation, and ribosome recycling.[A232294, A232334, A232339] Recent evidence suggests that the latter effect is due to a cryptic second binding site situated in h69 of the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit.[A232329, A232339] Also, by stabilizing a conformation that mimics correct codon-anticodon pairing, aminoglycosides promote error-prone translation.[A232344] Mistranslated proteins can incorporate into the cell membrane, inducing the damage discussed above.[A232294, A232319]', NULL, 'DrugBank');

DNA gyrase is an enzyme found only in bacteria that introduces negative supercoils into DNA during replication - this helps to relieve torsional strain caused by the introduction of positive supercoils during replication, and these negative supercoils are essential for chromosome condensation and the promotion of transcription initiation.[A31453] It is comprised of four subunits (two A subunits and two B subunits) of which the A subunits appear to be the target of fluoroquinolone antibiotics.[A190663] Bacterial topoisomerase IV, in addition to contributing to the relaxation of positive supercoils, is essential at the terminal stages of DNA replication and functions to “unlink” newly replicated chromosomes to allow for the completion of cell division.[A31453]

Cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy are associated with the release of serotonin (5-HT) from enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine, presumably initiating a vomiting reflex through stimulation of 5-HT3 receptors located on vagal afferents [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Ondansetron may block the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a central release of serotonin from the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Thus, the antiemetic effect of ondansetron is probably due to the selective antagonism of 5-HT3 receptors on neurons located in either the peripheral or central nervous systems, or both [F3178, F3181, F3184].



Although the mechanisms of action of ondansetron in treating postoperative nausea and vomiting and cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting may share similar pathways, the role of ondansetron in opiate-induced emesis has not yet been formally established [F3181, F3184].', 'Ondansetron is a highly specific and selective serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist, not shown to have activity at other known serotonin receptors and with low affinity for dopamine receptors [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161]. The serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery, and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161]. The temporal relationship between the emetogenic action of emetogenic drugs and the release of serotonin, as well as the efficacy of antiemetic agents, suggest that chemotherapeutic agents release serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine by causing degenerative changes in the GI tract [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161]. The serotonin then stimulates the vagal and splanchnic nerve receptors that project to the medullary vomiting center, as well as the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors in the area postrema, thus initiating the vomiting reflex, causing nausea and vomiting [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161].



Moreover, the effect of ondansetron on the QTc interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo and positive (moxifloxacin) controlled, crossover study in 58 healthy adult men and women [F3181, F3184]. Ondansetron was tested at single doses of 8 mg and 32 mg infused intravenously over 15 minutes [F3181, F3184]. At the highest tested dose of 32 mg, prolongation of the Fridericia-corrected QTc interval (QT/RR0.33=QTcF) was observed from 15 min to 4 h after the start of the 15 min infusion, with a maximum mean (upper limit of 90% CI) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline-correction of 19.6 (21.5) msec at 20 min [F3181, F3184]. At the lower tested dose of 8 mg, QTc prolongation was observed from 15 min to 1 h after the start of the 15-minute infusion, with a maximum mean (upper limit of 90% CI) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline-correction of 5.8 (7.8) msec at 15 min [F3181, F3184]. The magnitude of QTc prolongation with ondansetron is expected to be greater if the infusion rate is faster than 15 minutes [F3181, F3184]. The 32 mg intravenous dose of ondansetron must not be administered [F3181, F3184]. No treatment-related effects on the QRS duration or the PR interval were observed at either the 8 or 32 mg dose [F3181, F3184].



An ECG assessment study has not been performed for orally administered ondansetron [F3181, F3184]. On the basis of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling, an 8 mg oral dose of ondansetron is predicted to cause a mean QTcF increase of 0.7 ms (90% CI -2.1, 3.3) at steady-state, assuming a mean maximal plasma concentration of 24.7 ng/mL (95% CI 21.1, 29.0) [F3181, F3184]. The magnitude of QTc prolongation at the recommended 5 mg/m2 dose in pediatrics has not been studied, but pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling predicts a mean increase of 6.6 ms (90% CI 2.8, 10.7) at maximal plasma concentrations [F3181, F3184]. 



In healthy subjects, single intravenous doses of 0.15 mg/kg of ondansetron had no effect on esophageal motility, gastric motility, lower esophageal sphincter pressure, or small intestinal transit time [F3178]. Multiday administration of ondansetron has been shown to slow colonic transit in healthy subjects [F3178]. Ondansetron has no effect on plasma prolactin concentrations [F3178].', 'DrugBank');

Hydrocarbons are capable of partitioning into the cell and cytoplasmic membrane of microorganisms and disrupt their vital functions, which may result in leakage of ions such as potassium, and the inhibition of respiration [A32439]. Eventually, cell lysis may occur due to weakening of the cell wall, and loss of turgor pressure and subsequent rupture of the cytoplasmic membrane [A32441]. The loss of 260-nm-absorbing material may be indicative of a damaged cytoplasmic membrane and loss of nucleic acids [A32441]. In _E. coli_, perturbed potassium homeostasis, glucose-dependent respiration, cell morphology, and ability to exclude propidium iodide was observed. 



Tea tree oil also mediates its antifungal actions in a similar way, where it alters the permeability of Candida albicans and inhibits its respiration in a dose-dependent manner [A32439]. Plasma and mitochondrial membranes of fungal species are also thought to be negatively affected by inhibition of glucose-induced medium acidification by tea tree oil, which involves inhibition of membrane ATPase responsible for the expulsion of protons [A32439]. Tea tree oil also inhibits the formation of germ tubes, or mycelial conversion, in _C. albicans_, thereby disrupting cell morphogenesis [A32439]. Water-soluble fraction of TTO, terpinen-4-ol, and α-terpineol, can inhibit the lipopolysaccharide-induced production of the inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-10 by human peripheral monocytes by approximately 50% and that of prostaglandin E2 by about 30% after 40 h [A32439].

Animal studies have shown that _ginkgo biloba_ works on several neurotransmitter pathways and brain structures. Flavones were shown to inhibit lipid peroxidation; inhibit the uptake of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine; and inhibit platelet aggregation.[A232404] Terpene lactones may also act as potent antagonists of the platelet-activating factor and may possess anti-ischemic and fibrinolytic effects.[A232379] They were also shown to downregulate adrenal peripheral benzodiazepine receptors and increase adrenocorticotropic hormone levels.[A232404] _Ginkgo biloba_ also reversibly inhibits monoamine oxidase A; and modestly inhibits anticholinesterase activity,[A232379, A232389] leading to enhanced cholinergic transmission in the brain.[A232394] 



Several studies suggest that _ginkgo biloba_ exerts neuroprotective effects by reducing free radical production in the prefrontal cortex, which may explain its improvement on short-term memory. _Ginkgo biloba_ extract acts as a free radical scavenger, protecting neurons from oxidative damage and apoptosis related to aging, cerebral ischemia, and neurodegenerative disorders.[A232379] _Ginkgo biloba_ also inhibits amyloid-β neurotoxicity and protects against hypoxic challenges and increased oxidative stress.[A232389] One study showed that bilobalide, a terpene lactone, delays the onset of hypoxic glycolysis.[A232404] _Ginkgo biloba_ has the potential to regulate metabolism, stabilize the membrane, and promote vasodilation. In the arterial endothelium, EGb stimulated the release of endogenous relaxing factors, such as endothelium-derived relaxing factor and prostacyclin. In the inflammatory environment that causes tissue damage, EGb promoted nitric oxide production, leading to enhanced peripheral and cerebral blood flow.[A232379] ', '_Ginkgo biloba_ is a herbal ingredient with demonstrated antioxidant, vasoactive, antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, antiplatelet, and fibrinolytic properties.[A232389, A232399] _Ginkgo biloba_ has been investigated for use in a variety of medical conditions, but the most extensively studied area is in the context of cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative disorders. _Ginkgo biloba_ was examined as a potential nootropic agent or cognitive enhancer but research findings supporting the therapeutic efficacy of _ginkgo biloba_ extract (EGb) in dementia remain controversial. Some clinical studies of dementia that were up to one year long showed that EGb improves the cognitive performance and social functioning of patients. However, other studies did not support its clinical benefit for patients with cognitive impairment and dementia. Numerous meta-analysis studies showed insufficient evidence of the effectiveness of EGb in reducing both all-cause dementia incidence and Alzheimer''s disease-associated dementia incidence in elderly patients with normal cognition or with mild cognitive impairment. Additionally, there is no up-to-date evidence that demonstrates the benefit of the long-term use of standardized EGb in reducing the risk of progression to Alzheimer''s disease. A 2012 meta-analysis did not support the use of EGb in enhancing cognitive function in healthy adults.[A232379]



In the context of cardiovascular diseases, a limited number of studies showed that EGb improved mortality or neurological recovery in the post-stroke period, reduced cognitive and neurological impairment after acute ischemic stroke, and improved blood flow in the coronary artery in patients with coronary artery disease. However, a systemic review found no statistical or clinically significant benefit of EGb for patients with peripheral arterial disease or hypertension. Overall, there is a lack of strong evidence in the use of EGb for the treatment or prevention of cardiovascular diseases.[A232379]



In a small trial, the use of EGb as an adjunctive treatment with citalopram improved depressive symptoms and cognitive function in patients with depression.[A232379] _Ginkgo biloba_ was also investigated as a potential treatment for antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction.[A2434] Another study showed EGb improving the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia. There is insufficient evidence to prove the effectiveness of EGb in these psychiatric disorders. Limited studies have investigated the role of _ginkgo biloba_ in the treatment of vertigo, tinnitus, vitiligo, macular degeneration, and glaucoma, as well as the prevention of acute mountain sickness. As results are either preliminary or controversial, more quality research is warranted.[A232379]', 'DrugBank');

The classical interpretation of PTX''s broad effects is due to its ability to act, _in vitro_, as a non-specific cyclic-3'',5''-phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor at millimolar concentrations; specifically, it has been proposed that inhibition of PDE type III and IV isozymes leads to elevated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which mediate diverse downstream effects.[A226420, A226425, A226430] This view has been challenged, specifically by observing those plasma concentrations of PTX in routine clinical use are typically only around 1μM, far lower than those used to inhibit PDEs _in vitro_.[A226430] Instead, several studies have suggested that PTX can modulate adenosine receptor function, specifically the Gα-coupled A2A receptor (A2AR). Whether PTX acts directly as an A2AR agonist is unclear, although it can clearly increase the response of A2AR to adenosine.[A16840, A16821, A226350, A226435] A2AR activation activates adenylyl cyclase, which increases intracellular cAMP levels; this observation may explain PTX''s ability to increase intracellular cAMP in a PDE-independent fashion.[A226440]



Elevated cAMP levels have numerous downstream effects. cAMP-mediated activation of protein kinase A (PKA) suppresses nuclear translocation of NF-κB, which suppresses transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and IL-6 as well as TNF-induced molecules such as adhesion molecules (ICAM1 and VCAM1) and the C-reactive protein (CRP).[A226415, A226445, A226450, A226455] PTX has also been shown to prevent the downstream phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK, which are responsible for assembling the NADPH oxidase involved in the neutrophil oxidative burst. This effect is due to a PKA-independent decrease in Akt phosphorylation and a PKA-dependent decrease in phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK.[A226450, A226465, A226470] This transcriptional regulation at least partially explains the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties of PTX.



Also, activated PKA can activate the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which itself blocks SMAD-driven gene transcription, effectively disrupting transforming growth factor (TGF-β1) signalling.[A226440, A226475] This results in lower levels of fibrinogenic molecules such as collagens, fibronectin, connective tissue growth factor, and alpha-smooth muscle actin.[A226440, A226450, A226475, A226460] Hence, disruption of TGF-β1 signalling may explain the anti-fibrotic effects of PTX, including at least some of the decrease in blood viscosity.



The picture is complicated by the observation that PTX metabolites M1, M4, and M5 have been shown to inhibit C5 Des Arg- and formyl-methionylleucylphenylalanine-induced superoxide production in neutrophils and M1 and M5 significantly contribute to PTX''s observed hemorheological effects.[A226415, A226430, A226480] Overall, PTX administration is associated with decreased pro-inflammatory molecules, an increase in anti-inflammatory molecules such as IL-10, and decreased production of fibrinogenic and cellular adhesion molecules.', 'Pentoxifylline, a synthetic dimethylxanthine derivative structurally related to [theophylline] and [caffeine], exhibits hemorheological, anti-oxidative, and anti-inflammatory properties and is traditionally indicated in the treatment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). In PAD patients with concurrent cerebrovascular and coronary artery diseases, pentoxifylline treatment has occasionally been associated with angina, arrhythmia, and hypotension. Concurrent use with [warfarin] should be associated with more frequent monitoring of prothrombin times. Also, patients with risk factors complicated by hemorrhages, such as retinal bleeding, peptic ulceration, and recent surgery, should be monitored periodically for bleeding signs.[L30300]', 'DrugBank');

The retention of phosphate plays a pivotal role in causing secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with osteodystrophy, and soft-tissue calcification. The mechanism by which phosphate retention leads to hyperparathyroidism is not clearly delineated. Therapeutic efforts directed toward the control of hyperphosphatemia include reduction in the dietary intake of phosphate, inhibition of absorption of phosphate in the intestine with phosphate binders, and removal of phosphate from the body by more efficient methods of dialysis. The rate of removal of phosphate by dietary manipulation or by dialysis is insufficient. Dialysis patients absorb 40% to 80% of dietary phosphorus. Therefore, the fraction of dietary phosphate absorbed from the diet needs to be reduced by using phosphate binders in most renal failure patients on maintenance dialysis. Calcium acetate when taken with meals combines with dietary phosphate to form insoluble calcium phosphate which is excreted in the feces. Maintenance of serum phosphorus below 6.0 mg/dl is generally considered as a clinically acceptable outcome of treatment with phosphate binders.

Copper is an essential element in the body and is incorporated into many oxidase enzymes as a cofactor [A19518]. It is also a component of zinc/copper super oxide dismutase, giving it an anti-oxidant role. Copper defiency occurs in Occipital Horn Syndrome and Menke''s disease both of which are associated with impaired development of connective tissue due to the lack of copper to act as a cofactor in protein-lysine-6-oxidase. Menke''s disease is also associated with progressive neurological impairment leading to death in infancy. The precise mechanisms of the effects of copper deficiency are vague due to the wide range of enzymes which use the ion as a cofactor.



Copper appears to reduce the viabilty and motility of spermatozoa [A19526]. This reduces the likelihood of fertilization with a copper IUD, producing copper''s contraceptive effect [A19526].

When formulated as a mouthwash or spray, benzydamine may be used to treat traumatic conditions like pharyngitis following tonsillectomy or the use of a naso-gastric tube, inflammatory conditions like pharyngitis, aphthous ulcers and oral ulceration due to radiation therapy, dentistry operations and procedures, or more general conditions like sore throat, sore tongue, sore gums, mouth ulcers, or discomfort caused by dentures. [L1121] 



When used as a topical cream, benzydamine may be employed to relieve symptoms associated with painful inflammatory conditions of the muscolo-skeletal system including acute inflammatory disorders such as myalgia and bursitis or traumatic conditions like sprains, strains, bruises, sore muscles, stiff joints, or even the after-effects of fractures. [ L1123]', 'Despite being categorized as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), benzydamine demonstrates various mechanisms of action that differ from those of traditional aspirin-like NSAIDs. In particular, benzydamine predominantly acts by inhibiting the synthesis of pro inflammatory cytokines like tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) without largely affecting other pro inflammatory cytokines (ie. such as IL-6 and IL-8) or anti-inflammatory cytokines (ie. like IL-10 or IL-1 receptor antagonist). [A31528, L1120]



Moreover, benzydamine is largely a weak inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis as it has been shown to effectively inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase enzyme activity only at concentrations of 1mM or greater. Considering most contemporary usages of benzydamine are topical applications that are generally not well absorbed through the skin and/or non-specialized mucosae, benzydamine does not often achieve the kind of absorption or blood concentrations necessary to cause any extraneous distant systemic effects or COX inhibition, allowing it to localize its action. [A31528, L1120]



Additionally, it is also hypothesized that benzydamine is capable of inhibiting the oxidative burst of neutrophils and membrane stabilization. These actions are exhibited by the substance’s ability to inhibit the release of granules from neutrophils and to stabilize lysosomes. [A31528, L1120]



Furthermore, benzydamine is capable of a local anaesthetic effect that may be related to its capability for inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators like substance P and calcitonin gene related peptide from sensory nerve endings. Since substance P is capable of causing the release of histamine from mast cells, benzydamine’s prevention of substance P release further contributes to an anti-inflammatory effect. [A31528, L1120]



Benzydamine also demonstrates a non-specific antibacterial activity against various bacterial strains that are resistant to broad-spectrum antibiotics such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline at concentrations of about 3 mmol/L. Combinatorial use of benzydamine and other antibiotics like tetracycline and chloramphenicol are also synergistic against antibiotic resistant strains of *Staphylococcus aureus* and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*. [A31528]', 'Benzydamine is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) designed to elicit local anesthetic and analgesic effects mainly for the mouth and throat. It specifically acts on the local mechanisms of inflammation such as pain, oedema, or granuloma. Typically applied topically, the drug demonstrates anti-inflammatory activity reducing oedema as well as exudate and granuloma formation. Moreover, benzydamine exhibits analgesic properties and local anaesthetic activity if pain is caused by an inflammatory condition. Benzydamine can be absorbed into the oral mucosa and intact skin. Once absorbed in the local area of pain or inflammation, benzydamine binds selectively to local inflamed tissues, usually allowing it to act with few adverse systemic effects. On average a period of 2 to 4 hours is necessary for the substance to reach peak plasma concentration. [L1120]

 

Benzydamine can be synthesized with the reaction of the N-benzyl derivative from methyl anthranilate with nitrous acid to give N-nitoso derivative. This is next reduced by sodium thiosulfate to give transient hydrazine. This hydrazine can then undergo spontaneous internal hydrazide formation. Treating this resultant enolate with 3-chloro-1-dimethylamkino propane ultimately yields benzydamine.', 'DrugBank');

• Pathologic hypersecretory conditions in adults', 'Hydrochloric acid (HCl) secretion into the gastric lumen is a process regulated mainly by the H(+)/K(+)-ATPase of the proton pump [A175180], expressed in high quantities by the parietal cells of the stomach. ATPase is an enzyme on the parietal cell membrane that facilitates hydrogen and potassium exchange through the cell, which normally results in the extrusion of potassium and formation of HCl (gastric acid) [A174295].



Omeprazole is a member of a class of antisecretory compounds, the substituted _benzimidazoles_, that stop gastric acid secretion by selective inhibition of the _H+/K+ ATPase_ enzyme system. Proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole bind covalently to cysteine residues via disulfide bridges on the alpha subunit of the _H+/K+ ATPase_ pump, inhibiting gastric acid secretion for up to 36 hours [A175192].  This antisecretory effect is dose-related and leads to the inhibition of both basal and stimulated acid secretion, regardless of the stimulus [FDA label].  



**Mechanism of H. pylori eradication**



Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is frequently associated with _Helicobacter pylori_ bacterial infection (NSAIDs) [A175195]. The treatment of H. pylori infection may include the addition of omeprazole or other proton pump inhibitors as part of the treatment regimen [FDA label], [A175198]. 

_H. pylori_ replicates most effectively at a neutral pH [A175213]. Acid inhibition in H. pylori eradication therapy, including proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole, raises gastric pH, discouraging the growth of H.pylori [A175198]. It is generally believed that proton pump inhibitors inhibit the _urease_ enzyme, which increases the pathogenesis of H. pylori in gastric-acid related conditions [A175216].   ', '**Effects on gastric acid secretion**



This drug decreases gastric acid secretion [FDA label]. After oral administration, the onset of the antisecretory effect of omeprazole is usually achieved within one hour, with the maximum effect occurring by 2 hours after administration. The inhibitory effect of omeprazole on acid secretion increases with repeated once-daily dosing, reaching a plateau after four days [FDA label].



**Effects on serum gastrin**



In studies of 200 or more patients, serum gastrin levels increased during the first 1-2 weeks of daily administration of therapeutic doses of omeprazole. This occurred in a parallel fashion with the inhibition of acid secretion. No further increase in serum gastrin occurred with continued omeprazole administration. Increased gastrin causes enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and increased serum Chromogranin A (CgA) levels. The increased CgA levels may lead to false positive results in diagnostic studies for neuroendocrine tumors [FDA label].



**Enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell effects**



Human gastric biopsy samples have been obtained from more than 3000 pediatric and adult patients treated with omeprazole in long-term clinical studies. The incidence of enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia in these studies increased with time; however, no case of ECL cell carcinoids, dysplasia, or neoplasia have been identified in these patients. These studies, however, are of insufficient in power and duration to draw conclusions on the possible influence of long-term administration of omeprazole in the development of any premalignant or malignant conditions [FDA label]. 



**Other effects**



Systemic effects of omeprazole in the central nervous system, cardiovascular and respiratory systems have not been found to date. Omeprazole, given in oral doses of 30 or 40 mg for 2-4 weeks, showed no effect on thyroid function, carbohydrate metabolism, or circulating levels of parathyroid hormone, cortisol, estradiol, testosterone, prolactin, cholecystokinin or secretin [FDA label].

This binding results in displacement of divalent cations and increased membrane permeability, allowing for aminoglycoside entry.[A232294, A232304, A232309, A232314]

The second “energy-dependent phase I” of aminoglycoside entry into the cytoplasm relies on the proton-motive force and allows a limited amount of aminoglycoside access to its primary intracellular target - the bacterial 30S ribosome.[A232294, A232314] This ultimately results in the mistranslation of proteins and disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane.[A233320] Finally, in the “energy-dependent phase II” stage, concentration-dependent bacterial killing is observed. Aminoglycoside rapidly accumulates in the cell due to the damaged cytoplasmic membrane, and protein mistranslation and synthesis inhibition is amplified.[A232294, A232314, A232319] The necessity of oxygen-dependent active transport explains why aminoglycosides are ineffective against anaerobic bacteria.[A234130]

Hence, aminoglycosides have both immediate bactericidal effects through membrane disruption and delayed bactericidal effects through impaired protein synthesis; observed experimental data and mathematical modeling support this two-mechanism model.[A232294, A232299]

Inhibition of protein synthesis is a key component of aminoglycoside efficacy. Structural and cell biological studies suggest that aminoglycosides bind to the 16S rRNA in helix 44 (h44), near the A site of the 30S ribosomal subunit, altering interactions between h44 and h45. This binding also displaces two important residues, A1492 and A1493, from h44, mimicking normal conformational changes that occur with successful codon-anticodon pairing in the A site.[A232324, A232329] Overall, aminoglycoside binding has several negative effects including inhibition of translation, initiation, elongation, and ribosome recycling.[A232294, A232334, A232339] Recent evidence suggests that the latter effect is due to a cryptic second binding site situated in h69 of the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit.[A232329, A232339] Also, by stabilizing a conformation that mimics correct codon-anticodon pairing, aminoglycosides promote error-prone translation.[A232344] Mistranslated proteins can incorporate into the cell membrane, inducing the damage discussed above.[A232294, A232319]', NULL, 'DrugBank');

Eventually, cell lysis may occur due to weakening of the cell wall, and loss of turgor pressure and subsequent rupture of the cytoplasmic membrane [A32441]. The loss of 260-nm-absorbing material may be indicative of a damaged cytoplasmic membrane and loss of nucleic acids [A32441].

Tea tree oil also mediates its antifungal actions in a similar way, where it alters the permeability of Candida albicans and inhibits its respiration in a dose-dependent manner [A32439].

The rate of removal of phosphate by dietary manipulation or by dialysis is insufficient. Dialysis patients absorb 40% to 80% of dietary phosphorus. Therefore, the fraction of dietary phosphate absorbed from the diet needs to be reduced by using phosphate binders in most renal failure patients on maintenance dialysis.

[L39095] Patients may experience ED due to a variety of causes including psychogenic, neurogenic, vasculogenic, iatrogenic, or endocrine. [A242392] These causes result in dysfunction of penile smooth muscle relaxation through either disrupted neuronal signaling or direct influence on smooth muscle cells. During sexual arousal, non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) neurons release nitric oxide (NO). Nitric oxide stimulates guanylate cyclase which converts guanosine triphosphate to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).[A242287, A242377] cGMP activates the cGMP-dependent kinase (PKG) in a signal cascade which activates K+ channels leading to inhibition of Ca2+ channels, inhibits platelet activation, and inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation while inducing apoptosis. This signal cascade is attenuated by PDE5 which breaks the phosphodiester bond of cGMP, converting it to GMP. Inhibition of PDE5 by tadalafil increases signaling via the PKG cascade which supports penile smooth muscle relaxation during sexual arousal by decreasing Ca2+ entry into smooth muscle cells. This smooth muscle relaxation allows blood to fill the corpus cavernosum thereby producing an erection.



In PAH, blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries is raised due to a variety of mechanisms stemming from endothelial dysfunction.[A242377] Decreased production of NO and prostacyclin reduce vasodilatory signaling while overproduction of endothelin-1 and thromboxane increase vasoconstriction. Inflammation, thromboses, and hypoxia later contribute to vascular remodeling which further reduces luminal size. The resultant increase in blood pressure reduces the capacity for gas exchange and increases afterload at the right ventricle, producing symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and dizziness as well as leading to right-sided heart failure. Tadalafil exerts its therapeutic effect in PAH through boosting NO-cGMP signaling to contribute to smooth muscle relaxation as with ED.



Lastly, tadalafil is used to treat BPH.[L39095] BPH produces urinary dysfunction through hyperproliferation of the epithelial and smooth muscle layers of the prostate.[A242382] The increased size of the prostate blocks urine flow through the urethra resulting in higher residual volumes due to incomplete emptying. Tadalafil does not appear to exert its benefit via smooth muscle relaxation of the prostate. It may instead exert its effect through a mix of increased oxygenation and decreased inflammation, which decreases tissue remodeling, and inhibition of cell proliferation through the cGMP cascade.



The decreased affinity for PDE6 compared to other PDE5 inhibitors may explain the decreased incidence of visual side effects as PDE6 is present in the eye and contributes to color vision.[L39100, L39105, A242287]', 'Tadalafil exerts a therapeutic effect in ED by increasing sexual stimulation-dependant smooth muscle relaxation in the penis, allowing the corpus cavernosum to fill with blood to produce an erection.[A242287, A242377] Smooth muscle relaxation in the pulmonary vasculature helps to produce vasodilation in PAH which reduces blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries.[A242377] In BPH, tadalafil may contribute to decreased smooth muscle cell proliferation which may reduce the size of the prostate and relieve the anatomical obstruction which produces urinary symptoms of BPH.[A242382] The decreased affinity of tadalafil for PDE6 compared to other PDE5 inhibitors may explain the reduced incidence of visual side effects.[L39100, L39105, A242287]', 'DrugBank');

Action on the external urinary sphincter is mediated via duloxetine''s CNS effects. Increased serotonin and norepinephrine concentrations in Onuf''s nucleus leads to increased activation of 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, and α<sub>1</sub> adrenergic receptors.[A178663,A178666] 5-HT<sub>2</sub> and α<sub>1</sub> are both G<sub>q</sub> coupled and their activation increases the activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C (IP<sub>3</sub>/PLC) pathway.[T116] This pathway leads to release of intracellular calcium stores, increasing intracellular calcium concentrations, and facilitating neuronal excitability. 5-HT<sub>3</sub> functions as a ligand-gated sodium channel which allows sodium to flow into the neuron when activated. Increased flow of sodium into the neuron contributes to depolarization and activation of voltage gated channels involved in action potential generation. The combined action of these three receptors contributes to increased excitability of the pudendal motor nerve in response to glutamate.



Also related to duloxetine''s action at the spinal cord is its modulation of pain. Increasing the concentration of serotonin and norepinephrine in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord increases descending inhibition of pain through activation of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic, and α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors.[A178705] 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, and α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic mediate neuronal activation as described above. The activated neuron in this case is the GABAergic inhibitory interneuron which synapses onto the nociceptive projection neuron to inhibit the transmission of painful stimuli to the brain. The 5-HT<sub>1</sub> and α<sub>2</sub> receptors are G<sub>i</sub>/G<sub>o</sub> coupled and their activation leads to increased potassium current through inward rectifier channels and decreased adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A signaling which contributes to neuronal inhibition.[A178705,T116] These inhibitory receptors are present on the projection neuron itself as well as the dorsal root ganglion which precedes it and serves to directly suppress the transmission of painful stimuli.



The mechanisms involved in duloxetine''s benefits in depression and anxiety have not been fully elucidated. Dysfunctional serotonin and norepinephrine signaling are thought to be involved and increases in the availability of these neurotransmitters at the synaptic cleft thought to mediate a therapeutic effect.[A178666] It is postulated that the involvement of serotonin and norepinephrine in area responsible for emotional modulation such as the limbic system contributes to the effects in mood disorders specifically but this has yet to be confirmed.



Duloxetine''s hypertensive effect is related to its intended pharmacological effect. Increased availability of norepinephrine leads to activation of adrenergic receptors on the vascular endothelium. Since the action of α<sub>1</sub> receptors predominates, vasoconstriction results as the G<sub>q</sub> coupled receptor mediates calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum to facilitate smooth muscle contraction.[T116]', 'Duloxetine, through increasing serotonin and norepinephrine concentrations in Onuf''s nucleus, enhances glutamatergic activation of the pudendal motor nerve which innervates the external urethral sphinter.[A178663,A178666] This enhanced signaling allows for stronger contraction. Increased contraction of this sphincter increases the pressure needed to produce an incontinence episode in stress urinary incontinence. Duloxetine has been shown to improve Patient Global Impression of Improvement and Incontinence Quality of Life scores.[A178669] It has also been shown to reduce the median incontinence episode frequency at doses of 40 and 80 mg.



Action at the dorsal horn of the spinal cord allows duloxetine to strengthen the the serotonergic and adrenergic pathways involved in descending inhibition of pain.[A178666,A178705] This results in an increased threshold of activation necessary to transmit painful stimuli to the brain and effective relief of pain, particularly in neuropathic pain. Pain relief has been noted in a variety of painful conditions including diabetic peripheral neuropathy, fibromyalgia, and osteoarthritis using a range of pain assessment surveys.[A178711]



While duloxetine has been shown to be effective in both animal models of mood disorders and in clinical trials for the treatment of these disorders in humans, the broad scope of its pharmacodynamic effects on mood regulation in the brain has yet to be explained.[A178714]



Increased blood pressure is a common side effect with duloxetine due to vasoconstriction mediated by the intended increase in norepinephrine signaling.[label,T116]', 'DrugBank');

It is recommended that patients take an orally inhaled short-acting bronchodilator 5-15 minutes prior to every inhaled mannitol dose.[L20024]', 'Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that is metabolically inert in humans and occurs naturally, as a sugar or sugar alcohol, in fruits and vegetables. Mannitol elevates blood plasma osmolality, resulting in enhanced flow of water from tissues, including the brain and cerebrospinal fluid, into interstitial fluid and plasma. As a result, cerebral edema, elevated intracranial pressure, and cerebrospinal fluid volume and pressure may be reduced. As a diurectic mannitol induces diuresis because it is not reabsorbed in the renal tubule, thereby increasing the osmolality of the glomerular filtrate, facilitating excretion of water, and inhibiting the renal tubular reabsorption of sodium, chloride, and other solutes. Mannitol promotes the urinary excretion of toxic materials and protects against nephrotoxicity by preventing the concentration of toxic substances in the tubular fluid. As an Antiglaucoma agent mannitol levates blood plasma osmolarity, resulting in enhanced flow of water from the eye into plasma and a consequent reduction in intraocular pressure. As a renal function diagnostic aid mannitol is freely filtered by the glomeruli with less than 10% tubular reabsorption. Therefore, its urinary excretion rate may serve as a measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR).



The exact mechanism of action of inhaled mannitol in the symptomatic maintenance treatment of cystic fibrosis remains unclear.[A223199, L20024] It is hypothesized that mannitol produces an osmotic gradient across the airway epithelium that draws fluid into the extracellular space and alters the properties of the airway surface mucus layer, allowing easier mucociliary clearance.[A223199]', 'Chemically, mannitol is an alcohol and a sugar, or a polyol; it is similar to xylitol or sorbitol. However, mannitol has a tendency to lose a hydrogen ion in aqueous solutions, which causes the solution to become acidic. For this reason, it is not uncommon to add a substance to adjust its pH, such as sodium bicarbonate. Mannitol is commonly used to increase urine production (diuretic). It is also used to treat or prevent medical conditions that are caused by an increase in body fluids/water (e.g., cerebral edema, glaucoma, kidney failure). Mannitol is frequently given along with other diuretics (e.g., furosemide, chlorothiazide) and/or IV fluid replacement.



Inhaled mannitol has the possibility to cause bronchospasm and hemoptysis; the occurrence of either should lead to discontinuation of inhaled mannitol.[L20024]', 'DrugBank');

Salicylic acid is also used as an active ingredient in gels which remove verrucas (plantar warts). Salicylic acid competitively inhibits oxidation of uridine-5-diphosphoglucose (UDPG) with nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide (NAD) and noncompetitively with UDPG.

Two of these, methylcobalamin and 5-deoxyadenosyl cobalamin, are primarily used by the body. Methionine synthase needs methylcobalamin as a cofactor. This enzyme is involved in the conversion of the amino acid homocysteine into methionine. Methionine in turn is required for DNA methylation. 5-Deoxyadenosyl cobalamin is a cofactor needed by the enzyme that converts L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. This conversion is an important step in the extraction of energy from proteins and fats. Furthermore, succinyl CoA is necessary for the production of hemoglobin, the substances that carries oxygen in red blood cells.', 'Hydroxocobalamin is a synthetic, injectable form of Vitamin B12. Hydroxocobalamin is actually a precursor of two cofactors or vitamins (Vitamin B12 and Methylcobalamin) which are involved in various biological systems in man. Vitamin B12 is required for the conversion of methylmalonate to succinate. Deficiency of this enzyme could therefore interfere with the production of lipoprotein in myelin sheath tissue and so give rise to neurological lesions. The second cofactor, Methylcobalamin, is necessary for the conversion of homocysteine to methionine which is essential for the metabolism of folic acid. Deficiency of tetrahydrafolate leads to reduced synthesis of thymidylate resulting in reduced synthesis of DNA which is essential for cell maturation. Vitamin B12 is also concerned in the maintenance of sulphydryl groups in reduced form, deficiency leading to decreased amounts of reduced SH content of erythrocytes and liver cells. Overall, vitamin B12 acts as a coenzyme for various metabolic functions, including fat and carbohydrate metabolism and protein synthesis. It is necessary for growth, cell replication, hematopoiesis, and nucleoprotein as well as myelin synthesis.

PGE<sub>2</sub> is the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.[A179023] It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.[T116,A179023] PGE<sub>2</sub> activates the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled EP<sub>1</sub> receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE<sub>2</sub> also activates the EP<sub>4</sub> receptor, coupled to G<sub>s</sub>, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE<sub>2</sub> act via EP<sub>3</sub> to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP<sub>2</sub> to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI<sub>2</sub> is known to play a role via its G<sub>s</sub>-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.



PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP<sub>2</sub> receptors.[T116,A179044] Similarly to β adrenergic receptors these are G<sub>s</sub>-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE<sub>2</sub> also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.[T116] PGD<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP<sub>1</sub> receptor.[A179044] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.



PGE<sub>2</sub> can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory G<sub>q</sub> EP<sub>3</sub> receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.[T116] This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever. NSAIDs prevent the generation of PGE<sub>2</sub> thereby reducing the activity of these neurons.

This binding results in displacement of divalent cations and increased membrane permeability, allowing for aminoglycoside entry.[A232294, A232304, A232309, A232314]

The second “energy-dependent phase I” of aminoglycoside entry into the cytoplasm relies on the proton-motive force and allows a limited amount of aminoglycoside access to its primary intracellular target - the bacterial 30S ribosome.[A232294, A232314] This ultimately results in the mistranslation of proteins and disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane.[A233320] Finally, in the “energy-dependent phase II” stage, concentration-dependent bacterial killing is observed. Aminoglycoside rapidly accumulates in the cell due to the damaged cytoplasmic membrane, and protein mistranslation and synthesis inhibition is amplified.[A232294, A232314, A232319] The necessity of oxygen-dependent active transport explains why aminoglycosides are ineffective against anaerobic bacteria.[A234130]

Hence, aminoglycosides have both immediate bactericidal effects through membrane disruption and delayed bactericidal effects through impaired protein synthesis; observed experimental data and mathematical modeling support this two-mechanism model.[A232294, A232299]

Inhibition of protein synthesis is a key component of aminoglycoside efficacy. Structural and cell biological studies suggest that aminoglycosides bind to the 16S rRNA in helix 44 (h44), near the A site of the 30S ribosomal subunit, altering interactions between h44 and h45. This binding also displaces two important residues, A1492 and A1493, from h44, mimicking normal conformational changes that occur with successful codon-anticodon pairing in the A site.[A232324, A232329] Overall, aminoglycoside binding has several negative effects including inhibition of translation, initiation, elongation, and ribosome recycling.[A232294, A232334, A232339] Recent evidence suggests that the latter effect is due to a cryptic second binding site situated in h69 of the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit.[A232329, A232339] Also, by stabilizing a conformation that mimics correct codon-anticodon pairing, aminoglycosides promote error-prone translation.[A232344] Mistranslated proteins can incorporate into the cell membrane, inducing the damage discussed above.[A232294, A232319]', NULL, 'DrugBank');

[L39095] Patients may experience ED due to a variety of causes including psychogenic, neurogenic, vasculogenic, iatrogenic, or endocrine. [A242392] These causes result in dysfunction of penile smooth muscle relaxation through either disrupted neuronal signaling or direct influence on smooth muscle cells. During sexual arousal, non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) neurons release nitric oxide (NO). Nitric oxide stimulates guanylate cyclase which converts guanosine triphosphate to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).[A242287, A242377] cGMP activates the cGMP-dependent kinase (PKG) in a signal cascade which activates K+ channels leading to inhibition of Ca2+ channels, inhibits platelet activation, and inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation while inducing apoptosis. This signal cascade is attenuated by PDE5 which breaks the phosphodiester bond of cGMP, converting it to GMP. Inhibition of PDE5 by tadalafil increases signaling via the PKG cascade which supports penile smooth muscle relaxation during sexual arousal by decreasing Ca2+ entry into smooth muscle cells. This smooth muscle relaxation allows blood to fill the corpus cavernosum thereby producing an erection.



In PAH, blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries is raised due to a variety of mechanisms stemming from endothelial dysfunction.[A242377] Decreased production of NO and prostacyclin reduce vasodilatory signaling while overproduction of endothelin-1 and thromboxane increase vasoconstriction. Inflammation, thromboses, and hypoxia later contribute to vascular remodeling which further reduces luminal size. The resultant increase in blood pressure reduces the capacity for gas exchange and increases afterload at the right ventricle, producing symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and dizziness as well as leading to right-sided heart failure. Tadalafil exerts its therapeutic effect in PAH through boosting NO-cGMP signaling to contribute to smooth muscle relaxation as with ED.



Lastly, tadalafil is used to treat BPH.[L39095] BPH produces urinary dysfunction through hyperproliferation of the epithelial and smooth muscle layers of the prostate.[A242382] The increased size of the prostate blocks urine flow through the urethra resulting in higher residual volumes due to incomplete emptying. Tadalafil does not appear to exert its benefit via smooth muscle relaxation of the prostate. It may instead exert its effect through a mix of increased oxygenation and decreased inflammation, which decreases tissue remodeling, and inhibition of cell proliferation through the cGMP cascade.

Eicosapentaenoic acids compete with constitutive levels of arachidonic acid in cell membranes for the same desaturation enzymes and produce 3-series prostaglandins and thromboxanes, and 5-series leukotrienes which have low pro-inflammatory potential. The alteration in leukotriene biosynthesis due to higher concentration of omega-3 fatty acids compared to arachidonic acid underlies the anti-inflammatory effects. 

EPA and DHA also give rise to resolvins and related lipid signalling molecules such as protectins via cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, which have anti-inflammatory effects.

Omega-3 fatty acids also decrease adhesion molecule expression on leukocytes and on endothelial cells and decrease intercellular adhesive interactions.

Omega-3 (or n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and their metabolites are natural ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma that regulates inflammatory gene expression and NFκB activation. PPAR alpha activation is also associated with induction of COX-2 expression.

It is often used in combination with [misoprostol] as a gastro-protective agent in patients with high risk of developing NSAID-induced ulcers.', 'Diclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 and -2, the enzymes responsible for production of prostaglandin (PG) G<sub>2</sub> which is the precursor to other PGs.[label,T116] These molecules have broad activity in pain and inflammation and the inhibition of their production is the common mechanism linking each effect of diclofenac.



PGE<sub>2</sub> is the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.[A179023] It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.[T116,A179023] PGE<sub>2</sub> activates the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled EP<sub>1</sub> receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE<sub>2</sub> also activates the EP<sub>4</sub> receptor, coupled to G<sub>s</sub>, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE<sub>2</sub> act via EP<sub>3</sub> to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP<sub>2</sub> to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI<sub>2</sub> is known to play a role via its G<sub>s</sub>-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.



PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP<sub>2</sub> receptors.[T116,A179044] Similarly to β adrenergic receptors these are G<sub>s</sub>-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE<sub>2</sub> also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.[T116] PGD<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP<sub>1</sub> receptor.[A179044] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.



PGE<sub>2</sub> can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory G<sub>q</sub> EP<sub>3</sub> receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.[T116] This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever. NSAIDs prevent the generation of PGE<sub>2</sub> thereby reducing the activity of these neurons.

Its combination of orthosteric and allosteric activity on SERT allows for greater extracellular 5-HT levels, a faster onset of action, and greater efficacy as compared to other SSRIs.

By increasing intestinal fluid secretion, lubiprostone increases motility in the intestine, thereby increasing the passage of stool and alleviating symptoms associated with chronic idiopathic constipation. Activation of ClC-2 chloride channels may also stimulate the recovery of muscosal barrier function by restoring tight junction protein complexes in the intestine.

Cineol containing preparations of eucalyptus oil may contain up to 80% (or more) 1,8-cineole [A32243] and is one of the most common types of eucalyptus oil formulations used. As an active agent indicated for relieving certain cold symptoms and/or certain muscular sprains and cramps, it is believed that eucalyptus oil may possess some antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities.



Some in vitro studies of human blood monocytes suggest a dose-dependent effect of eucalyptus oil to elicit significant inhibition of multiple cytokines, perhaps in the treatment of airway inflammation [A32244, A32245]. Moreover, other studies in animal models discuss the possibility of eucalyptus oil demonstrating anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects that potentially account for inhibiting the formation of prostaglandins and cytokines by stimulated monocytes in vitro [A32246, A32247].



Furthermore, additional studies have observed eucalyptus oil anti-viral activity against herpes simplex virus (HSV-1, HSV-2) in cell cultures as well as the demonstration of broad antimicrobial activity of eucalyptus medicinal plant extracts against Alicyclobacillus acidoterretris, Bacillus cereus, E. coli, Enterococcus faecalis, MRSA, Propionibacterium acnes, S. aureus, fungus including C. albicans isolates, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and other Gram-positive bacteria. Specific activity against periodontopathic bacteria, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sobrinus has also been observed [A32250, A32251, A32252, A32253, A32254].', 'Lipophilic monoterpene formulations of eucalyptus oil appear to be readily absorbed orally, with a primarily oxidative metabolism that might necessitate induction of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system and subsequent urinary excretion [A32236]. Gastrointestinal absorption of eucalyptus appears to be rapid and may be enhanced by the intake of lipids and milk. 1,8-cineole (which makes up to as much as 90% of most commonly used cineole-based eucalyptus oils) [A32227] has also been found in vitro and in animals to possess cytochrome P450 inducing activity [A32237, A32238, A32239].', 'DrugBank');

In Canada, rizatriptan is approved in adults.[L46038, L46043] In the US, the oral tablet formulations are used in patients six years of age and older [L46018] and the oral film formation is approved for patients 12 years of age and older weighing 40 kg or more.[L46023] ', 'There are several physiological and molecular processes implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine. Vasodilation of intracranial extracerebral blood vessels, particularly those supplying the dura mater, has been associated with migraine pain.[A1460, A258928] Activation of the trigeminovascular system leads to the release of vasoactive neuropeptides (such as substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and neurokinin A) from the trigeminal nerve innervating the intracranial vessels and dura mater. Vasoactive neuropeptides cause perivascular inflammation and vasodilation in the periphery. Migraine-associated nausea and vomiting are thought to arise from the activation of central and nociceptive sensory neurons that project to autonomic brain-stem nuclei and higher subcortical and cortical pain processing centres.[A1460] An imbalance in serotonin (5-HT) levels has also been documented: 5-HT binds to 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors to promote trigeminal neuronal firing and vasoconstriction.[A1460, A258968]



Rizatriptan is a selective agonist at the 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system. It binds to these receptors with high affinity.[L46018] The exact mechanism of action of rizatriptan has not been fully elucidated; however, several documented pharmacological actions of rizatriptan may contribute to its antimigraine effects. Rizatriptan causes vasoconstriction of intracranial extracerebral blood vessels, which is thought to occur primarily via 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> receptors. Rizatriptan also inhibits nociceptive neurotransmission in trigeminal pain pathways. It attenuates the release of vasoactive neuropeptides by the trigeminal nerve, which is thought to occur via neurogenic and central 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors.[A1460, A258918, A258928] Rizatriptan inhibited neurogenic dural vasodilation and plasma protein extravasation in animal studies.[A1460, A5971, A258918, A258928]', 'Rizatriptan relieves migraine-associated symptoms.[A1460, A258928, L46018] Rizatriptan is reported to reach the maximum plasma concentrations more quickly and produces a more rapid onset of pain relief than other triptans, such as [sumatriptan];[A1464, A258918, A258928] however, it has a relatively shorter elimination half-life than other triptans.[A258928] Rizatriptan causes transient increases in blood pressure to some extent.[A1460] _In vitro_, rizatriptan was shown to contract isolated human coronary arteries; however, since the EC<sub>50</sub> for this effect is high, rizatriptan is not expected to cause myocardial ischemia at therapeutic plasma concentrations in patients with normal coronary circulation.[A258918]



Rizatriptan has a weak affinity for other 5-HT1 receptor subtypes (5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1E</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1F</sub>) and the 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor but has no significant activity at 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, alpha- and beta-adrenergic, dopaminergic, histaminergic, muscarinic or benzodiazepine receptors.[L46038]', 'DrugBank');

Intravenous indometacin is indicated to induce closure of a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants weighing between 500 and 1750 g when after 48 hours usual medical management (e.g., fluid restriction, diuretics, digitalis, respiratory support, etc.) is ineffective.[L10553]', 'Indometacin is a nonspecific and reversible inhibitor of the cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzyme or prostaglandin G/H synthase. There are two identified isoforms of COX: COX-1 is universally present in most body tissues and is involved in the synthesis of the prostaglandins and thromboxane A2, while COX-2 is expressed in response to injury or inflammation.[A177871] Constitutively expressed, the COX-1 enzyme is involved in gastric mucosal protection, platelet, and kidney function by catalyzing the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin (PG) G2 and PGG2 to PGH2.[A177871] COX-2 is constitutively expressed and highly inducible by inflammatory stimuli. It is found in the central nervous system, kidneys, uterus, and other organs. COX-2 also catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to PGG2 and PGG2 to PGH2. In the COX-2-mediated pathway, PGH2 is further converted to PGE2 and PGI2 (also known as prostacyclin). PGE2 is involved in mediating inflammation, pain, and fever. Decreasing levels of PGE2 leads to reduced inflammatory reactions. Indometacin is known to inhibit both isoforms of COX, however, with greater selectivity for COX-1, which accounts for its increased adverse gastric effects relative to other NSAIDs. It binds to the enzyme''s active site and prevents the interaction between the enzyme and its substrate, arachidonic acid. Indometacin, unlike other NSAIDs, also inhibits phospholipase A2, the enzyme responsible for releasing arachidonic acid from phospholipids. The analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects of indomethacin as well as adverse reactions associated with the drug occur as a result of decreased prostaglandin synthesis. Its antipyretic effects may be due to action on the hypothalamus, resulting in increased peripheral blood flow, vasodilation, and subsequent heat dissipation.



The exact mechanism of action of indometacin in inducing closure of a patent ductus arteriosus is not fully understood; however, it is thought to be through inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.[L6778] At birth, the ductus arteriosus is normally closed as the tension of the oxygen increases significantly after birth.[A177880] Patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants is associated with congenital heart malformations where PGE1 mediates an opposite effect to that of oxygen. PGE1 dilates the ductus arteriosus through smooth muscle relaxation and prevents the closure of the ductus arteriosus.[A177880] By inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins, indometacin promotes the closure of ductus arteriosus.[L10553]



Indometacin has been described as possessing anticancer and antiviral properties through activation of protein kinase R (PKR) and downstream phosphorylation of eIF2α, inhibiting protein synthesis.[A234429, A234434]', 'Indometacin is an NSAID with analgesic and antipyretic properties that exerts its pharmacological effects by inhibiting the synthesis of factors involved in pain, fever, and inflammation. Its therapeutic action does not involve pituitary-adrenal stimulation.[L6778] Indometacin primarily works by suppressing inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis by providing relief of pain as well as reducing fever, swelling, and tenderness. This effectiveness has been demonstrated by a reduction in the extent of joint swelling, the average number of joints displaying symptoms of inflammation, and the severity of morning stiffness. Increased mobility was demonstrated by a decrease in total walking time and by improved functional capability seen as an increase in grip strength.[L6778] In clinical trials, indometacin was shown to be effective in relieving the pain, reducing the fever, swelling, redness, and tenderness of acute gouty arthritis. Due to its pharmacological actions, the use of indometacin is associated with the risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, as well as gastrointestinal effects such as bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines.[L6778]



In a study of healthy individuals, acute oral and intravenous indometacin therapy resulted in a transiently diminished basal and CO2 stimulated cerebral blood flow; this effect disappeared in one study after one week of oral treatment.[L6778] The clinical significance of this effect has not been established. Compared to other NSAIDs, it is suggested that indometacin is a more potent vasoconstrictor that is more consistent in decreasing cerebral blood flow and inhibiting CO2 reactivity.[A177871] There have been studies that show indometacin directly inhibiting neuronal activity to some extent in the trigeminocervical complex after either superior salivatory nucleus or dural stimulation.[A177871]', 'DrugBank');

The Health Canada monograph for rosuvastatin further specifies that rosuvastatin is indicated for the reduction of elevated total cholesterol (Total-C), LDL-C, ApoB, the Total-C/HDL-C ratio and triglycerides (TG) and for increasing HDL-C in hyperlipidemic and dyslipidemic conditions when response to diet and exercise alone has been inadequate. It is also indicated for the prevention of major cardiovascular events (including risk of myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and coronary artery revascularization) in adult patients without documented history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events, but with at least two conventional risk factors for cardiovascular disease.[F4652]



Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]', 'Rosuvastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A181421] Rosuvastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which increases hepatic uptake of LDL. Rosuvastatin also inhibits hepatic synthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL).[F4649] The overall effect is a decrease in plasma LDL and VLDL. 



In vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that rosuvastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] This includes improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response.



Statins have also been found to bind allosterically to β2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and in T cell activation.[A181559]



Rosuvastatin exerts an anti-inflammatory effect on rat mesenteric microvascular endothelium by attenuating leukocyte rolling, adherence and transmigration.[A1807] The drug also modulates nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression and reduces ischemic-reperfusion injuries in rat hearts.[A1787] Rosuvastatin increases the bioavailability of nitric oxide[A1807,A1799,A1787] by upregulating NOS[A1791] and by increasing the stability of NOS through post-transcriptional polyadenylation.[A1796] It is unclear as to how rosuvastatin brings about these effects though they may be due to decreased concentrations of mevalonic acid.', 'Rosuvastatin is a synthetic, enantiomerically pure antilipemic agent. It is used to lower total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and trigleride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, rosuvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A181087, A181406]



Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]



**Skeletal Muscle Effects**



Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. These risks can occur at any dose level, but are increased at the highest dose (40 mg). Rosuvastatin should be prescribed with caution in patients with predisposing factors for myopathy (e.g., age ≥ 65 years, inadequately treated hypothyroidism, renal impairment).



The risk of myopathy during treatment with rosuvastatin may be increased with concurrent administration of some other lipid-lowering therapies (such as [fenofibrate] or [niacin]), [gemfibrozil], [cyclosporine], [atazanavir]/[ritonavir], [lopinavir]/ritonavir, or [simeprevir].  Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin, coadministered with [colchicine], and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together.[F4649] 



Real-world data from observational studies has suggested that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]



**Liver Enzyme Abnormalities**



Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. In most cases, the elevations were transient and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. There were two cases of jaundice, for which a relationship to rosuvastatin therapy could not be determined, which resolved after discontinuation of therapy. There were no cases of liver failure or irreversible liver disease in these trials.[F4649]



**Endocrine Effects**



Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin calcium tablets. Based on clinical trial data with rosuvastatin, in some instances these increases may exceed the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.[F4649]



An in vitro study found that [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], and [pitavastatin] exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on human pancreas islet β cells, with reductions in cell viability of 32, 41, 34 and 29%, respectively, versus control]. Moreover, insulin secretion rates were decreased by 34, 30, 27 and 19%, respectively, relative to control.[A182012]



HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and lower cholesterol levels and, as such, might theoretically blunt adrenal or gonadal steroid hormone production. Rosuvastatin demonstrated no effect upon nonstimulated cortisol levels and no effect on thyroid metabolism as assessed by TSH plasma concentration. In rosuvastatin treated patients, there was no impairment of adrenocortical reserve and no reduction in plasma cortisol concentrations. Clinical studies with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have suggested that these agents do not reduce plasma testosterone concentration. The effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on male fertility have not been studied. The effects, if any, on the pituitarygonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown.[F4652]



**Cardiovascular**



Ubiquinone levels were not measured in rosuvastatin clinical trials, however significant decreases in circulating ubiquinone levels in patients treated with other statins have been observed. The clinical significance of a potential long-term statin-induced deficiency of ubiquinone has not been established. It has been reported that a decrease in myocardial ubiquinone levels could lead to impaired cardiac function in patients with borderline congestive heart failure.[F4652]



**Lipoprotein A**



In some patients, the beneficial effect of lowered total cholesterol and LDL-C levels may be partly blunted by a concomitant increase in the Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentrations. Present knowledge suggests the importance of high Lp(a) levels as an emerging risk factor for coronary heart disease. It is thus desirable to maintain and reinforce lifestyle changes in high-risk patients placed on rosuvastatin therapy.[F4652] Further studies have demonstrated statins affect Lp(a) levels differently in patients with dyslipidemia depending on their apo(a) phenotype; statins increase Lp(a) levels exclusively in patients with the low molecular weight apo(a) phenotype.[A181418]', 'DrugBank');

Tramadol is also used off-label in the treatment of premature ejaculation.[A173986]', 'Tramadol is a centrally acting μ-opioid receptor agonist and SNRI (serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake-inhibitor) that is structurally related to [codeine] and [morphine]. Tramadol binds weakly to κ- and δ-opioid receptors and to the μ-opioid receptor with 6000-fold less affinity than morphine.[A182300]



Tramadol exists as a racemic mixture consisting of two pharmacologically active enantiomers that both contribute to its analgesic property through different mechanisms: (+)-tramadol and its primary metabolite (+)-O-desmethyl-tramadol (M1) are agonists of the μ opioid receptor while (+)-tramadol inhibits serotonin reuptake and (-)-tramadol inhibits norepinephrine reuptake. These pathways are complementary and synergistic, improving tramadol''s ability to modulate the perception of and response to pain.[A4269] 



In animal models, M1 is up to 6 times more potent than tramadol in producing analgesia and 200 times more potent in μ-opioid binding.[L9257] 



Tramadol has also been shown to affect a number of pain modulators including alpha2-adrenoreceptors, neurokinin 1 receptors, the voltage-gated sodium channel type II alpha subunit[A183728], transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1 - also known as the capsaicin receptor)[A183734], muscarinic receptors (M1 and M3), N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (also known as the NMDA receptor or glutamate receptor)[A17158], Adenosine A1 receptors[A183761], and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.[A17159] 



In addition to the above neuronal targets, tramadol has a number of effects on inflammatory and immune mediators involved in the pain response. This includes inhibitory effects on cytokines, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), nuclear factor-κB, and glial cells as well as a change in the polarization state of M1 macrophages.[A182300]', 'Tramadol modulates the descending pain pathways within the central nervous system through the binding of parent and M1 metabolite to μ-opioid receptors and the weak inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.[A173983,A173980] 



Apart from analgesia, tramadol may produce a constellation of symptoms (including dizziness, somnolence, nausea, constipation, sweating and pruritus) similar to that of other opioids. 



**Central Nervous System**



In contrast to [morphine], tramadol has not been shown to cause histamine release. At therapeutic doses, tramadol has no effect on heart rate, left-ventricular function or cardiac index. Orthostatic hypotension has been observed.[L9257]



Tramadol produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centres. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem centres to increases in CO2 tension and to electrical stimulation. 



Tramadol depresses the cough reflex by a direct effect on the cough centre in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia.



Tramadol causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but

are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce

similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of

oxycodone overdose.[F4679]



Seizures have been reported in patients receiving tramadol within the recommended dosage range. Spontaneous post-marketing reports indicate that seizure risk is increased with doses of tramadol above the recommended range. Risk of convulsions may also increase in patients with epilepsy, those with a history of seizures

or in patients with a recognized risk for seizure (such as head trauma, metabolic disorders,

alcohol and drug withdrawal, CNS infections), or with concomitant use of other drugs known to reduce the seizure threshold.[F4679]



Tramadol can cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs (e.g., anti-depressants, migraine medications). Treatment with the serotoninergic drug should be discontinued if such events (characterized by clusters of symptoms such as hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs, mental status changes including confusion, irritability, extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma) occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated. Tramadol should not be used in combination with MAO inhibitors or serotonin-precursors (such as L-tryptophan, oxitriptan) and should be used with caution in combination with other serotonergic drugs (triptans, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lithium, St. John’s Wort) due to the risk of serotonin syndrome.[F4679]



**Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle**



Tramadol causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.[F4679]



**Endocrine System**



Opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal or -gonadal axes. Some changes that can be seen include an increase in serum prolactin and decreases in plasma cortisol and testosterone. Clinical signs and symptoms may be manifest from these hormonal changes.[F4679]



Hyponatremia has been reported very rarely with the use of tramadol, usually in patients with predisposing risk factors, such as elderly patients and/or patients using concomitant medications that may cause hyponatremia (e.g., antidepressants, benzodiazepines, diuretics). In some reports, hyponatremia appeared to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) and resolved with discontinuation of tramadol and appropriate treatment (e.g., fluid restriction). During tramadol treatment, monitoring for signs and symptoms of hyponatremia is recommended for patients with predisposing risk factors.[F4679]



**Cardiovascular**



Tramadol administration may result in severe hypotension in patients whose ability to maintain adequate blood pressure is compromised by reduced blood volume, or concurrent administration of drugs such as phenothiazines and other tranquillizers, sedative/hypnotics, tricyclic antidepressants or general anesthetics. These patients should be monitored for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of tramadol.[F4679]



**QTc-Interval Prolongation**



The maximum placebo-adjusted mean change from baseline in the QTcF interval was 5.5 ms in the 400 mg/day treatment arm and 6.5 ms in the 600 mg/day mg treatment arm, both occurring at the 8h time point. Both treatment groups were within the 10 ms threshold for QT prolongation. Post-marketing experience with the use of tramadol containing products included rare reports of QT prolongation reported with an overdose. Particular care should be exercised when administering tramadol to patients who are suspected to be at an increased risk of experiencing torsade de pointes during treatment with a QTc-prolonging drug.[F4679]



**Abuse and Misuse**



Like all opioids, tramadol has the potential for abuse and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Therefore, tramadol should be prescribed and handled with caution.[F4679]



**Dependence/Tolerance**



Physical dependence and tolerance reflect the neuroadaptation of the opioid receptors to chronic exposure to an opioid and are separate and distinct from abuse and addiction. Tolerance, as well as physical dependence, may develop upon repeated administration of opioids, and are not by themselves evidence of an addictive disorder or abuse. Patients on prolonged therapy should be tapered gradually from the drug if it is no longer required for pain control. Withdrawal symptoms may occur following abrupt discontinuation of therapy or upon administration of an opioid antagonist. Some of the symptoms that may be associated with abrupt withdrawal of an opioid analgesic include body aches, diarrhea, gooseflesh, loss of appetite, nausea, nervousness or restlessness, anxiety, runny nose, sneezing, tremors or shivering, stomach cramps, tachycardia, trouble with sleeping, unusual increase in sweating, palpitations, unexplained fever, weakness and yawning.[F4679]', 'DrugBank');

Corticosteroids like betamethasone can act through nongenomic and genomic pathways.[A31458] The genomic pathway is slower and occurs when glucocorticoids activate glucocorticoid receptors and initiate downstream effects that promote transcription of anti-inflammatory genes including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), IL-1-receptor antagonist, and tyrosine amino transferase (TAT).[A31458] On the other hand, the nongenomic pathway is able to elicit a quicker response by modulating T-cell, platelet and monocyte activity through the use of existing membrane-bound receptors and second messengers.[A31458]', 'Corticosteroids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor inhibiting pro-inflammatory signals, while promoting anti-inflammatory signals.[A187463] Corticosteroids have a wide therapeutic window as patients may require doses that are multiples of what the body naturally produces.[A187463] Patients who require long-term treatment with a corticosteroid should be counselled regarding the risk of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression and increased susceptibility to infections.[A187463]', 'DrugBank');

After administration, metronidazole enters cells by passive diffusion. Following this, ferredoxin or flavodoxin reduce its nitro group to nitro radicals.

The redox potential of the electron transport portions of anaerobic or microaerophilic microorganisms renders metronidazole selective to these organisms, which cause nitro group reduction, leading to the production of toxic metabolites. These include N-(2-hydroxyethyl) oxamic acid and acetamide, which may damage DNA of replicating organisms.[A181039]', 'Metronidazole treats amebiasis, trichomoniasis, and giardiasis, exerting both antibacterial and antiprotozoal activities.[L7432] Metronidazole is an effective treatment for some anaerobic bacterial infections.[A181057] Metronidazole has shown antibacterial activity against the majority of obligate anaerobes, however, during in vitro studies, it does not demonstrate significant action against facultative anaerobes or obligate aerobes.[L3754] The nitro group reduction of metronidazole by anaerobic organisms is likely responsible for the drug''s antimicrobial cytotoxic effects, causing DNA strand damage to microbes.[A181039,A181045]

Historically, cod liver oil was often given to children because the vitamin d content in the oil had been shown to prevent or treat vitamin D deficiency and condition of rickets associated with it [A33159]. Over time, this common use in children growing up may have conferred upon cod liver oil its identity as a healthy and useful all-purpose dietary supplement.



However, since cod liver oil is a composite of several other nutritional compounds including the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as well as vitamin A and vitamin D [A33159, L2872, L2871], the presence in varying amounts of all of these compounds at once makes it difficult to recommend or use cod liver oil as an appropriate supplement to confer any one particular health effect or for any one particular nutritional deficiency.



Regardless, because it does contain a combination of a number of important and healthy nutritional compounds, cod liver oil has sometimes been recommended in the literature for conferring the health effects of some of these compounds, such as the potential use of cod liver oil supplements in post-heart attack patients for secondary prophylaxis associated with the use of omega-3 fatty acids [A33165].', 'As cod liver oil consists of the component compounds of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), vitamin A, and vitamin D [A33159, L2872, L2871] further information about the mechanisms of action of these cod liver oil components can be found by searching for fish oil, vitamin A, and vitamin D on DrugBank.', 'As cod liver oil is a composite of several other nutritional compounds including the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as well as vitamin A and vitamin D [A33159, L2872, L2871], the presence in varying amounts of all of these compounds at once makes it difficult to recommend or use cod liver oil as an appropriate supplement to confer any one particular health effect or for any one particular nutritional deficiency.



For example, one tablespoon of cod liver oil contains approximately 4,080 ug of retinol (vitamin A) and 34 ug (1,360 IU) of vitamin D [L2871]. Since the general dietary reference intake of vitamin A is only 900 ug per day for adult men, 700 ug per day for women, and 3000 ug per day as the tolerable upper intake level, the regular intake of cod liver oil as a regular supplement can result in harmful levels of vitamin A accumulating in the liver and sufficient to cause hypervitaminosis A [A33163], which is associated with various symptoms such as blurred vision, changes in consciousness, skin and hair changes, liver damage, among many others.



Moreover, while cod liver oil only contains a certain percentage of the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA per amount of the oil [L2871], separate fish oils supplement products that exclusively consist of only EPA and DHA are available in a great variety of different percentage content formulations, even including prescription strength formulations should certain patients need such a level of therapy. Furthermore, such exclusive omega-3 fatty acid supplement products do not contain any vitamin A or D either, which allows patients to use the supplements without any concern about affecting their vitamin A or D levels or exposing themselves to the unnecessary excess intake of vitamins.



Subsequently, although cod liver oil contains a combination of healthy dietary supplements like EPA, DHA, vitamin A, and vitamin D, the presence in varying amounts of all of these compounds all at once makes it difficult to effectively titrate for appropriate amounts of intake for all the compounds involved when using cod liver oil as a general supplement, often resulting in either an excess or insufficient amount of one or more the aforementioned compounds.



Nevertheless, because cod liver oil does consist of the component compounds of EPA, DHA, vitamin A, and vitamin D, further information about the pharmacodynamics of these cod liver oil components can be found by searching for fish oil, vitamin A, and vitamin D on DrugBank.', 'DrugBank');

Its combination of orthosteric and allosteric activity on SERT allows for greater extracellular 5-HT levels, a faster onset of action, and greater efficacy as compared to other SSRIs. [A185825,A185726] The sustained elevation of synaptic 5-HT eventually causes desensitization of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> auto-receptors, which normally shut down endogenous 5-HT release in the presence of excess 5-HT - this desensitization may be necessary for the full clinical effect of SSRIs and may be responsible for their typically prolonged onset of action.[A185828,A185726]



Escitalopram has shown little-to-no binding affinity at a number of other receptors, such as histamine and muscarinic receptors, and minor activity at these off-targets may explain some of its adverse effects.[L8513,L8516,L8522,A185726]', 'Escitalopram belongs to a class of medications called selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs).

SSRIs as a class have been associated with abnormal bleeding, particularly in patients receiving concomitant therapy with other medications affecting hemostasis, and with the development of serotonin syndrome. Use escitalopram with caution in patients with a higher-than-baseline risk of bleeding and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with other serotonergic drugs.

It is also indicated for the prevention of major cardiovascular events (including risk of myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and coronary artery revascularization) in adult patients without documented history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events, but with at least two conventional risk factors for cardiovascular disease.[F4652]



Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]', 'Rosuvastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A181421] Rosuvastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which increases hepatic uptake of LDL. Rosuvastatin also inhibits hepatic synthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL).[F4649] The overall effect is a decrease in plasma LDL and VLDL. 



In vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that rosuvastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] This includes improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response.



Statins have also been found to bind allosterically to β2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and in T cell activation.[A181559]



Rosuvastatin exerts an anti-inflammatory effect on rat mesenteric microvascular endothelium by attenuating leukocyte rolling, adherence and transmigration.[A1807] The drug also modulates nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression and reduces ischemic-reperfusion injuries in rat hearts.[A1787] Rosuvastatin increases the bioavailability of nitric oxide[A1807,A1799,A1787] by upregulating NOS[A1791] and by increasing the stability of NOS through post-transcriptional polyadenylation.[A1796] It is unclear as to how rosuvastatin brings about these effects though they may be due to decreased concentrations of mevalonic acid.', 'Rosuvastatin is a synthetic, enantiomerically pure antilipemic agent. It is used to lower total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and trigleride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, rosuvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A181087, A181406]



Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]



**Skeletal Muscle Effects**



Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. These risks can occur at any dose level, but are increased at the highest dose (40 mg). Rosuvastatin should be prescribed with caution in patients with predisposing factors for myopathy (e.g., age ≥ 65 years, inadequately treated hypothyroidism, renal impairment).



The risk of myopathy during treatment with rosuvastatin may be increased with concurrent administration of some other lipid-lowering therapies (such as [fenofibrate] or [niacin]), [gemfibrozil], [cyclosporine], [atazanavir]/[ritonavir], [lopinavir]/ritonavir, or [simeprevir].  Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin, coadministered with [colchicine], and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together.[F4649] 



Real-world data from observational studies has suggested that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]



**Liver Enzyme Abnormalities**



Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. In most cases, the elevations were transient and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. There were two cases of jaundice, for which a relationship to rosuvastatin therapy could not be determined, which resolved after discontinuation of therapy. There were no cases of liver failure or irreversible liver disease in these trials.[F4649]



**Endocrine Effects**



Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin calcium tablets. Based on clinical trial data with rosuvastatin, in some instances these increases may exceed the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.[F4649]



An in vitro study found that [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], and [pitavastatin] exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on human pancreas islet β cells, with reductions in cell viability of 32, 41, 34 and 29%, respectively, versus control]. Moreover, insulin secretion rates were decreased by 34, 30, 27 and 19%, respectively, relative to control.[A182012]



HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and lower cholesterol levels and, as such, might theoretically blunt adrenal or gonadal steroid hormone production. Rosuvastatin demonstrated no effect upon nonstimulated cortisol levels and no effect on thyroid metabolism as assessed by TSH plasma concentration. In rosuvastatin treated patients, there was no impairment of adrenocortical reserve and no reduction in plasma cortisol concentrations. Clinical studies with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have suggested that these agents do not reduce plasma testosterone concentration. The effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on male fertility have not been studied. The effects, if any, on the pituitarygonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown.[F4652]



**Cardiovascular**



Ubiquinone levels were not measured in rosuvastatin clinical trials, however significant decreases in circulating ubiquinone levels in patients treated with other statins have been observed. The clinical significance of a potential long-term statin-induced deficiency of ubiquinone has not been established. It has been reported that a decrease in myocardial ubiquinone levels could lead to impaired cardiac function in patients with borderline congestive heart failure.[F4652]



**Lipoprotein A**



In some patients, the beneficial effect of lowered total cholesterol and LDL-C levels may be partly blunted by a concomitant increase in the Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentrations. Present knowledge suggests the importance of high Lp(a) levels as an emerging risk factor for coronary heart disease. It is thus desirable to maintain and reinforce lifestyle changes in high-risk patients placed on rosuvastatin therapy.[F4652] Further studies have demonstrated statins affect Lp(a) levels differently in patients with dyslipidemia depending on their apo(a) phenotype; statins increase Lp(a) levels exclusively in patients with the low molecular weight apo(a) phenotype.[A181418]', 'DrugBank');

• Angiographically documented coronary artery disease in patients without heart failure or an ejection fraction < 40%', '**Mechanism of action on blood pressure**



Amlodipine is considered a peripheral arterial vasodilator that exerts its action directly on vascular smooth muscle to lead to a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance, causing a decrease in blood pressure. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow-channel blocker) that inhibits the influx of calcium ions into both vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Experimental studies imply that amlodipine binds to both _dihydropyridine_ and _nondihydropyridine_ binding sites, located on cell membranes. The contraction of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent on the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells by specific ion channels. Amlodipine blocks calcium ion influx across cell membranes with selectivity. A stronger effect of amlodipine is exerted on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells [FDA label]. Direct actions of amlodipine on vascular smooth muscle result in reduced blood pressure [F3757]. 



**Mechanism of action in angina**



The exact mechanism by which amlodipine relieves the symptoms of angina have not been fully elucidated to this date, however, the mechanism of action is likely twofold:



Amlodipine has a dilating effect on peripheral arterioles, reducing the total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the cardiac muscle functions. Since the heart rate remains stable during amlodipine administration, the reduced work of the heart reduces both myocardial energy use and oxygen requirements [F3757].



Dilatation of the main coronary arteries and coronary arterioles, both in healthy and ischemic areas, is another possible mechanism of amlodipine reduction of blood pressure. The dilatation causes an increase in myocardial oxygen delivery in patients experiencing coronary artery spasm (Prinzmetal''s or variant angina) and reduces coronary vasoconstriction caused by smoking [F3757].', '**General pharmacodynamic effects**



Amlodipine has a strong affinity for cell membranes, modulating calcium influx by inhibiting selected membrane calcium channels. This drug''s unique binding properties allow for its long-acting action and less frequent dosing regimen [A573], [FDA label].  



**Hemodynamic effects**



After the administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine to patients diagnosed with hypertension, amlodipine causes vasodilation, which results in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressure. During these blood pressure reductions, there are no clinically significant changes in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with long-term use. Acute intravenous administration of amlodipine reduces arterial blood pressure and increases heart rate in patients with chronic stable angina, however, chronic oral administration of amlodipine in clinical studies did not cause clinically significant alterations in heart rate or blood pressures in patients diagnosed with angina and normal blood pressure. With long-term, once daily oral administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours [FDA label]. 



**Electrophysiologic effects**



Amlodipine does not change sinoatrial (SA) nodal function or atrioventricular (AV) conduction in animals or humans. In patients who were diagnosed with chronic stable angina, the intravenous administration of 10 mg of amlodipine did not cause clinically significant alterations A-H and H-V conduction and sinus node recovery time after cardiac pacing. Patients administered amlodipine with concomitant beta-blockers produced similar results. In clinical trials in which amlodipine was given in combination with beta-blockers to patients diagnosed with hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were noted. In clinical studies comprised of angina patients alone, amlodipine did not change electrocardiographic intervals or produce high degrees of AV block [FDA label]. 



**Effects on angina**



Amlodipine relieves the symptoms of chest pain associated with angina. In patients diagnosed with angina, daily administration of a single amlodipine dose increases total exercise time, the time to angina onset, and the time to 1 mm ST-segment depression on ECG studies, decreases anginal attack frequency, and decreases the requirement for nitroglycerin tablets [F3757].

PPIs such as esomeprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health.

It binds to membrane bound oxytocin receptors on the myometrium and prevents oxytocin-stimulated increases in inositol triphosphate production [A32685]. This ultimately prevents release of stored calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and subsequent opening of voltage gated calcium channels. This shutdown of cytosolic calcium increase prevents contractions of the uterine muscle, reducing the frequency of contractions and inducing uterine quiescence.



Atosiban has more recently been found to act as a biased ligand at oxytocin receptors [A32694,A32695]. It acts as an antagonist of Gq coupling, explaining the inhibition of the inositol triphosphate pathway thought to be responsible for the effect on uterine contraction, but acts as an agonist of Gi coupling.

Because glucosamine is a precursor for glycosaminoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans are a major component of joint cartilage,[A232289] glucosamine supplements may help to rebuild cartilage and treat the symptoms of arthritis.  Some in vitro studies show evidence that glucosamine reduces inflammation via inhibition of interferon gamma[A12619,A12616,A12621]  and Nuclear factor kappa B subunit 65 (NF-κB p65),[A12616,A232284] improving the symptoms of arthritis and joint pain.

It is used to provide local anesthesia by nerve blockade at various sites in the body [F4349, L5930, L5948]. It does so by stabilizing the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action [F4349, L5930, L5948]. In particular, the lidocaine agent acts on sodium ion channels located on the internal surface of nerve cell membranes [F4349, L5930, L5948]. At these channels, neutral uncharged lidocaine molecules diffuse through neural sheaths into the axoplasm where they are subsequently ionized by joining with hydrogen ions [F4349, L5930, L5948]. The resultant lidocaine cations are then capable of reversibly binding the sodium channels from the inside, keeping them locked in an open state that prevents nerve depolarization [F4349, L5930, L5948]. As a result, with sufficient blockage, the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron will ultimately not depolarize and will thus fail to transmit an action potential [F4349, L5930, L5948]. This facilitates an anesthetic effect by not merely preventing pain signals from propagating to the brain but by aborting their generation in the first place [F4349, L5930, L5948].



In addition to blocking conduction in nerve axons in the peripheral nervous system, lidocaine has important effects on the central nervous system and cardiovascular system [F4349, L5930, L5948]. After absorption, lidocaine may cause stimulation of the CNS followed by depression and in the cardiovascular system, it acts primarily on the myocardium where it may produce decreases in electrical excitability, conduction rate, and force of contraction [F4349, L5930, L5948].', 'Excessive blood levels of lidocaine can cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure [F4349, L5930]. With central neural blockade these changes may be attributable to the block of autonomic fibers, a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system, and/or the beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating action of epinephrine when present [F4349, L5930]. The net effect is normally a modest hypotension when the recommended dosages are not exceeded [F4349, L5930].



In particular, such cardiac effects are likely associated with the principal effect that lidocaine elicits when it binds and blocks sodium channels, inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of electrical action potential impulses necessary to facilitate muscle contraction [F4349, L5930, L5948]. Subsequently, in cardiac myocytes, lidocaine can potentially block or otherwise slow the rise of cardiac action potentials and their associated cardiac myocyte contractions, resulting in possible effects like hypotension, bradycardia, myocardial depression, cardiac arrhythmias, and perhaps cardiac arrest or circulatory collapse [F4349, L5930, L5948].



Moreover, lidocaine possesses a dissociation constant (pKa) of 7.7 and is considered a weak base [L5948]. As a result, about 25% of lidocaine molecules will be un-ionized and available at the physiological pH of 7.4 to translocate inside nerve cells, which means lidocaine elicits an onset of action more rapidly than other local anesthetics that have higher pKa values [L5948]. This rapid onset of action is demonstrated in about one minute following intravenous injection and fifteen minutes following intramuscular injection [L5930]. The administered lidocaine subsequently spreads rapidly through the surrounding tissues and the anesthetic effect lasts approximately ten to twenty minutes when given intravenously and about sixty to ninety minutes after intramuscular injection [L5930].



Nevertheless, it appears that the efficacy of lidocaine may be minimized in the presence of inflammation [L5948]. This effect could be due to acidosis decreasing the amount of un-ionized lidocaine molecules, a more rapid reduction in lidocaine concentration as a result of increased blood flow, or potentially also because of increased production of inflammatory mediators like peroxynitrite that elicit direct actions on sodium channels [L5948].', 'DrugBank');

It was believed that ricinoleic acid acts as an anionic surfactant that reduces net absorption of fluid and electrolytes, and stimulates intestinal peristalsis [F70]. However, a recent study suggests that ricinoleic acid interacts with EP3 prostanoid receptors expressed on intestinal and uterine smooth muscles. Via activating EP3 prostanoid receptors on intestinal and uterine smooth muscle cells, ricinoleic acid promotes laxation and uterus contraction, respectively [A33043].

Dyslipidemia describes an elevation of plasma cholesterol, triglycerides or both as well as to the presence of low levels of high-density lipoprotein. This condition represents an increased risk for the development of atherosclerosis.[L6025] 



Atorvastatin is indicated, in combination with dietary modifications, to prevent cardiovascular events in patients with cardiac risk factors and/or abnormal lipid profiles.[A177397]



Atorvastatin can be used as a preventive agent for myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization, and angina, in patients without coronary heart disease but with multiple risk factors and in patients with type 2 diabetes without coronary heart disease but multiple risk factors.[A177397]



Atorvastatin may be used as a preventive agent for non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal and non-fatal stroke, revascularization procedures, hospitalization for congestive heart failure and angina in patients with coronary heart disease.[A177397]



Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]', 'Atorvastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A177388,A181421] Atorvastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, which increases hepatic uptake of LDL. Atorvastatin also reduces Very-Low-Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol (VLDL-C), serum triglycerides (TG) and Intermediate Density Lipoproteins (IDL), as well as the number of apolipoprotein B (apo B) containing particles, but increases High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C). 



_In vitro_ and _in vivo_ animal studies also demonstrate that atorvastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] These effects include improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response. Statins were also found to bind allosterically to β2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an essential role in leukocyte trafficking and T cell activation.[A181559]', 'Atorvastatin is an oral antilipemic agent that reversibly inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. It lowers total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apo B), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease, and high ratios are associated with a higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, atorvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A174580,A181087,A181406,A181925] 



Elevated cholesterol levels (and high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in particular) are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Clinical studies have shown that atorvastatin reduces LDL-C and total cholesterol by 36-53%.[A177415] In patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia, atorvastatin reduced the levels of intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol.[A177397] It has also been suggested that atorvastatin can limit the extent of angiogenesis, which can be useful in the treatment of chronic subdural hematoma.[A177388]



**Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis**



Atorvastatin, like other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, is associated with a risk of drug-induced myopathy characterized by muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness in conjunction with elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK). Myopathy often manifests as rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria. The risk of statin-induced myopathy is dose-related, and the symptoms of myopathy are typically resolved upon drug discontinuation. Results from observational studies suggest that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]



**Liver Dysfunction**



Statins, like some other lipid-lowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (> 3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] occurring on two or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin in clinical trials. This effect appears to be dose-related.[F4670,F4673]



**Endocrine Effects**



Statins are associated with a risk of increased serum HbA1c and glucose levels. An _in vitro_ study demonstrated a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on human pancreatic islet β cells following treatment with atorvastatin. Moreover, insulin secretion rates decreased relative to control.[A182012]



HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and may theoretically interfere with the production of adrenal and/or gonadal steroids. Clinical studies with atorvastatin and other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have suggested that these agents do not affect plasma cortisol concentrations, basal plasma testosterone concentration, or adrenal reserve. However, the effect of statins on male fertility has not been fully investigated. The effects of statins on the pituitary-gonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown.[F4673]



**Cardiovascular**



Significant decreases in circulating ubiquinone levels in patients treated with atorvastatin and other statins have been observed. The clinical significance of a potential long-term statin-induced deficiency of ubiquinone has not been established. It has been reported that a decrease in myocardial ubiquinone levels could lead to impaired cardiac function in patients with borderline congestive heart failure.[F4673]



**Lipoprotein A**



In some patients, the beneficial effect of lowered total cholesterol and LDL-C levels may be partly blunted by the concomitant increase in Lp(a) lipoprotein concentrations. Present knowledge suggests the importance of high Lp(a) levels as an emerging risk factor for coronary heart disease.[F4673] Further studies have demonstrated statins affect Lp(a) levels differently in patients with dyslipidemia depending on their apo(a) phenotype; statins increase Lp(a) levels exclusively in patients with the low molecular weight apo(a) phenotype.[A181418]', 'DrugBank');

It is also used in combination with [sacubitril].[L36445]', 'Valsartan belongs to the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs, which selectively bind to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) and prevent angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects. These include vasoconstriction, stimulation and synthesis of aldosterone and ADH, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium among others. Overall, valsartan''s physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium. 



Valsartan also affects the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays an important role in hemostasis and regulation of kidney, vascular, and cardiac functions. Pharmacological blockade of RAAS via  AT1 receptor blockade inhibits negative regulatory feedback within RAAS which is a contributing factor to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal disease. In particular, heart failure is associated with chronic activation of RAAS, leading to inappropriate fluid retention, vasoconstriction, and ultimately a further decline in left ventricular function. ARBs have been shown to have a protective effect on the heart by improving cardiac function, reducing afterload, increasing cardiac output and prevent ventricular hypertrophy.[A174154]



The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) class of medications (which includes drugs such as [ramipril], [lisinopril], and [perindopril]) inhibits the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II by inhibiting the ACE enzyme but does not prevent the formation of all angiotensin II. ARB activity is unique in that it blocks all angiotensin II activity, regardless of where or how it was synthesized. 



Valsartan is commonly used for the management of hypertension, heart failure, and type 2 diabetes-associated nephropathy, particularly in patients who are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors. ARBs such as valsartan have been shown in a number of large-scale clinical outcomes trials to improve cardiovascular outcomes including reducing risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, the progression of heart failure, and hospitalization.[A174124,A178153,A173869,A185324,A185327,A185333,A185342,A185345] Valsartan also slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy due to its renoprotective effects.[A174157,A174160,A174163] Improvements in chronic kidney disease with valsartan include both clinically and statistically significant decreases in urinary albumin and protein excretion in patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and in nondiabetic patients diagnosed with chronic kidney disease.[A174124,A173869]



Valsartan also binds to the AT2 receptor, however AT2 is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis like AT1. Valsartan has about 20,000-fold higher affinity for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. The increased plasma levels of angiotensin II following AT1 receptor blockade with valsartan may stimulate the unblocked AT2 receptor.[L11305]', 'Valsartan inhibits the pressor effects of angiotensin II with oral doses of 80 mg inhibiting the pressor effect by about 80% at peak with approximately 30% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. Removal of the negative feedback of angiotensin II causes a 2- to 3-fold rise in plasma renin and consequent rise in angiotensin II plasma concentration in hypertensive patients. Minimal decreases in plasma aldosterone were observed after administration of valsartan.



In multiple-dose studies in hypertensive patients, valsartan had no notable effects on total cholesterol, fasting triglycerides, fasting serum glucose, or uric acid.[L11305]



**Hypotension** 



Excessive hypotension was rarely seen (0.1%) in patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with valsartan alone. In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- and/or salt-depleted patients receiving high doses of diuretics, symptomatic hypotension may occur. This condition should be corrected prior to administration of valsartan, or the treatment should start under close medical supervision. 



Caution should be observed when initiating therapy in patients with heart failure. Patients with heart failure given valsartan commonly have some reduction in blood pressure, but discontinuation of therapy because of continuing symptomatic hypotension usually is not necessary when dosing instructions are followed. In controlled trials in heart failure patients, the incidence of hypotension in valsartan-treated patients was 5.5% compared to 1.8% in placebo-treated patients. 



If excessive hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized.[L11305]





**Impaired Renal Function**



Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and by diuretics. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on valsartan. Monitor renal function periodically in these patients. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on valsartan.[L11305]





**Hyperkalemia**



Some patients with heart failure have developed increases in potassium. These effects are usually minor and transient, and they are more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Dosage reduction and/or discontinuation of valsartan may be required.[L11305]', 'DrugBank');

Furthermore, some formulations like chewable montelukast tablets may also be specifically indicated by particular regulatory bodies for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma, including the prevention of day and night-time symptoms, the treatment of acetylsalicylic acid based asthma, and the prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in adult and pediatric patients aged 2 and older[L6328], between the ages 2 and 5[L6325], or between the ages of 6 and 14 years.[L6331]



Moreover, when employed for such indications montelukast is considered effective as monotherapy or when combined with other medications indicated for the maintenance treatment of chronic asthma.[L6304,L6328] For instance, montelukast and inhaled corticosteroids can be used concomitantly to demonstrate additive effects to control asthma or to decrease the necessary inhaled corticosteroid dose while still maintaining clinical stability.[L6304,L6328]



Additionally, in patients who continue to experience asthma symptoms, montelukast can also be combined with an ''as required'' short-acting beta-agonist, an inhaled corticosteroid, or inhaled corticosteroid paired with a long-acting beta-agonist.[L6304,L6328]', 'Cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLT) like LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4, among others, are eicosanoids released by a variety of cells like mast cells and eosinophils.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] When such CysLT bind to corresponding CysLT receptors like CysLT type-1 receptors located on respiratory airway smooth muscle cells, airway macrophages, and on various pro-inflammatory cells like eosinophils and some specific myeloid stem cells activities that facilitate the pathophysiology of asthma and allergic rhinitis are stimulated.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]



In particular, CysLT-mediated airway bronchoconstriction, occluding mucous secretion, vascular permeability, and eosinophil recruitment are all types of effects that facilitate asthma.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Alternatively, in allergic rhinitis, CysLTs are released by the nasal mucosa when exposed to allergens during both early and late phase reactions and participate in eliciting symptoms of allergic rhinitis like a congested nose and airway.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]



Subsequently, montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that binds with high affinity and selectivity to the CysLT type 1 receptor, which consequently assists in inhibiting any physiological actions of CysLTs like LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 at the receptor that may facilitate asthma or allergic rhinitis.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]', 'Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that demonstrates a marked affinity and selectivity to the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor type-1 in preference to many other crucial airway receptors like the prostanoid, cholinergic, or beta-adrenergic receptors.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] As a consequence, the agent can elicit substantial blockage of LTD4 leukotriene-mediated bronchoconstriction with doses as low as 5 mg.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Moreover, a placebo-controlled, crossover study (n=12) demonstrated that montelukast is capable of inhibiting early and late phase bronchoconstriction caused by antigen challenge by 75% and 57% respectively.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]

Insulin binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor is able to autophosphorylate and phosphorylate numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. These activated proteins, in turn, lead to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC) which play a critical role in metabolism and catabolism.', 'Insulin is a natural hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas. In non-diabetic individuals, a basal level of insulin is supplemented with insulin spikes following meals. Postprandial insulin spikes are responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to absorptive state. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. Insulin also promotes growth and is required for the actions of growth hormone (e.g. protein synthesis, cell division, DNA synthesis). ', 'DrugBank');

Both oxcarbazepine and MHD are thought to inhibit seizure activity by binding to the inactive state of voltage-gated sodium channels, thus prolonging the period in which the receptor is unavailable for action potential propagation.[A186101] This helps to stabilize hyperexcited neuronal membranes, inhibit repetitive neuron firing, and prevent the spread of seizure activity within the CNS without affecting normal neuronal transmission.[L8627,L8630,L8633]



Increased potassium conductance and modulation of voltage-activated calcium channels is also thought to play a role in the anti-seizure activity of oxcarbazepine.[L8627,L8630,L8633] Inhibition of glutamatergic activity was thought to contribute to oxcarbazepine''s activity[A34516], but this effect could not be replicated _in vivo_.[A186104]', 'Oxcarbazepine is an anticonvulsant drug that reduces the incidence of seizures in epilepsy by inhibiting abnormal electrical activity in the brain.[L8627,L8630,L8633]

**Nasal spray**



The cyanocobalamin nasal spray is indicated for the maintenance of vitamin B12 concentrations after normalization with intramuscular vitamin B12 therapy in patients with deficiency of this vitamin who have no nervous system involvement [FDA label].



Note:  CaloMist [FDA label], the nasal spray form, has not been evaluated for the treatment of newly diagnosed vitamin B12 deficiency.



**Injection forms (subcutaneous, intramuscular)**



These forms are indicated for vitamin B12 deficiencies due to various causes, with or without neurologic manifestations [F3736].  Vitamin B12 deficiency is frequently caused by malabsorption, which is often associated with the following conditions [L5545]:



Addisonian (pernicious) anemia



Gastrointestinal pathology, dysfunction, or surgery, including gluten enteropathy or sprue, small bowel bacterial overgrowth, total or partial gastrectomy



Fish tapeworm infestation



Malignancy of the pancreas or bowel



Folic acid deficiency





**Oral forms**



Vitamin B12 supplements are widely available and indicated in patients who require supplementation for various reasons.  Dose requirements for vitamin B12 which are higher than normal (caused by pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, hepatic and renal disease) can usually be achieved with oral supplementation [L5545].   Oral products of vitamin B12 are not recommended in patients with malabsorption, as these forms are primarily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract [F3739]. ', 'Vitamin B12 serves as a cofactor for _methionine synthase_ and _L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase_ enzymes. Methionine synthase is essential for the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines that form DNA. L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase converts L-methylmalonyl-CoA to _succinyl-CoA_ in the degradation of propionate [L2064], an important reaction required for both fat and protein metabolism. It is a lack of vitamin B12 cofactor in the above reaction and the resulting accumulation of methylmalonyl CoA that is believed to be responsible for the neurological manifestations of B12 deficiency [A175255]. Succinyl-CoA is also necessary for the synthesis of hemoglobin [L2064]. 



In tissues, vitamin B12 is required for the synthesis of _methionine_ from homocysteine.   Methionine is required for the formation of S-adenosylmethionine, a methyl donor for nearly 100 substrates, comprised of DNA, RNA, hormones, proteins, as well as lipids [L2064]. Without vitamin B12, tetrahydrofolate cannot be regenerated from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, and this can lead to functional folate deficiency [L5554], [FDA label]. 

This reaction is dependent on methylcobalamin (vitamin B12) as a co-factor and is also dependent on folate, in which the methyl group of methyltetrahydrofolate is transferred to homocysteine to form _methionine_ and _tetrahydrofolate_. Vitamin B12 incorporates into circulating folic acid into growing red blood cells; retaining the folate in these cells [L5557]. A deficiency of vitamin B12 and the interruption of this reaction leads to the development of megaloblastic anemia.  ', '

**General effects**



Cyanocobalamin corrects vitamin B12 deficiency and improves the symptoms and laboratory abnormalities associated with pernicious anemia (megaloblastic indices, gastrointestinal lesions, and neurologic damage). This drug aids in growth, cell reproduction, hematopoiesis, nucleoprotein, and myelin synthesis.  It also plays an important role in fat metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, as well as protein synthesis. Cells that undergo rapid division (for example, epithelial cells, bone marrow, and myeloid cells) have a high demand for vitamin B12 [A175255]. 

 

**Parenteral cyanocobalamin effects**



The parenteral administration of vitamin B12 rapidly and completely reverses the megaloblastic anemia and gastrointestinal symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency. Rapid parenteral administration of vitamin B12 in deficiency related neurological damage prevents the progression of this condition [L5545]. 



**Nasal spray effects**



In 24 vitamin B12 deficient patients who were already stabilized on intramuscular (IM) vitamin B12 therapy, single daily doses of intranasal cyanocobalamin for 8 weeks lead to serum vitamin B12 concentrations that were within the target therapeutic range (>200 ng/L) [FDA label].

', '**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].



Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].



In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].



There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].



Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].



The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. 



In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].



In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].



The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].', 'Zinc is involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of human proteins may bind zinc, in addition to hundreds of proteins that transport and traffic zinc. It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is an essential element for a proper sense of taste and smell and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations [L2211].



Studies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions [L2095]:



**Colds:** Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently [L2095].



**Wound healing:** Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements [L2095]. 



**Diahrrea**: Oral zinc supplements can reduce the symptoms of diarrhea in children with low levels of zinc, especially in cases of malnutrition [L2095].

', 'There are two isoforms of ACE: the somatic isoform, which exists as a glycoprotein comprised of a single polypeptide chain of 1277; and the testicular isoform, which has a lower molecular mass and is thought to play a role in sperm maturation and binding of sperm to the oviduct epithelium. Somatic ACE has two functionally active domains, N and C, which arise from tandem gene duplication. Although the two domains have high sequence similarity, they play distinct physiological roles. The C-domain is predominantly involved in blood pressure regulation while the N-domain plays a role in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and proliferation. ACE inhibitors bind to and inhibit the activity of both domains, but have much greater affinity for and inhibitory activity against the C-domain. Captopril, one of the few ACE inhibitors that is not a prodrug, competes with ATI for binding to ACE and inhibits and enzymatic proteolysis of ATI to ATII. Decreasing ATII levels in the body decreases blood pressure by inhibiting the pressor effects of ATII as described in the Pharmacology section above. Captopril also causes an increase in plasma renin activity likely due to a loss of feedback inhibition mediated by ATII on the release of renin and/or stimulation of reflex mechanisms via baroreceptors. Captopril’s affinity for ACE is approximately 30,000 times greater than that of ATI.', 'Captopril, an ACE inhibitor, antagonizes the effect of the RAAS. The RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from the granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. In the blood stream, renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to ATI, which is subsequently cleaved to ATII by ACE. ATII increases blood pressure using a number of mechanisms. First, it stimulates the secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone travels to the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and collecting tubule of nephrons where it increases sodium and water reabsorption by increasing the number of sodium channels and sodium-potassium ATPases on cell membranes. Second, ATII stimulates the secretion of vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone or ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland. ADH stimulates further water reabsorption from the kidneys via insertion of aquaporin-2 channels on the apical surface of cells of the DCT and collecting tubules. Third, ATII increases blood pressure through direct arterial vasoconstriction. Stimulation of the Type 1 ATII receptor on vascular smooth muscle cells leads to a cascade of events resulting in myocyte contraction and vasoconstriction. In addition to these major effects, ATII induces the thirst response via stimulation of hypothalamic neurons. ACE inhibitors inhibit the rapid conversion of ATI to ATII and antagonize RAAS-induced increases in blood pressure. ACE (also known as kininase II) is also involved in the enzymatic deactivation of bradykinin, a vasodilator. Inhibiting the deactivation of bradykinin increases bradykinin levels and may sustain its effects by causing increased vasodilation and decreased blood pressure.', 'DrugBank');

Empagliflozin is not approved for use in patients with type 1 diabetes.', 'The vast majority of glucose filtered through the glomerulus is reabsorbed within the proximal tubule, primarily via SGLT2 (sodium-glucose linked co-transporter-2) which is responsible for ~90% of the total glucose reabsorption within the kidneys. Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase on the basolateral membrane of proximal tubular cells utilize ATP to actively pump Na+ ions into the interstitium surrounding the tubule, establishing a Na<sup>+</sup> gradient within the tubular cell. SGLT2 on the apical membrane of these cells then utilize this gradient to facilitate secondary active co-transport of both Na+ and glucose out of the filtrate, thereby reabsorbing glucose back into the blood – inhibiting this co-transport, then, allows for a marked increase in glucosuria and decrease in blood glucose levels.[A203453] Empagliflozin is a potent inhibitor of renal SGLT2 transporters located in the proximal tubules of the kidneys and works to lower blood glucose levels via an increase in glucosuria.[L13688]



Empagliflozin also appears to exert cardiovascular benefits - specifically in the prevention of heart failure - independent of its blood glucose-lowering effects, though the exact mechanism of this benefit is not precisely understood.

Patients should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis regardless of blood glucose level as empagliflozin may precipitate diabetic ketoacidosis in the absence of hyperglycemia.[L13688] As its mechanism of action is contingent on the renal excretion of glucose, empagliflozin may be held in cases of acute kidney injury and/or discontinued in patients who develop chronic renal disease. 



The overexcretion of glucose creates a sugar-rich urogenital environment which increases the risk of urogenital infections in both male and female patients - monitor closely for signs and symptoms of developing infection.[L13688]', 'DrugBank');

Pharyngitis/tonsillitis caused by _Streptococcus pyogenes_ as an alternative to first-line therapy in individuals who cannot use first-line therapy.', 'In order to replicate, bacteria require a specific process of protein synthesis, enabled by ribosomal proteins [A6505]. Azithromycin binds to the 23S rRNA of the bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit. It stops bacterial protein synthesis by inhibiting the transpeptidation/translocation step of protein synthesis and by inhibiting the assembly of the 50S ribosomal subunit [FDA label], [A14179]. This results in the control of various bacterial infections [A174193], [FDA label].   The strong affinity of macrolides, including azithromycin, for bacterial ribosomes, is consistent with their broad‐spectrum antibacterial activities [A174193].





Azithromycin is highly stable at a low pH, giving it a longer serum half-life and increasing its concentrations in tissues compared to erythromycin [A174175].

Under EMA approval, such fish oil pharmaceuticals comprised of virtually the same fish and fish oil derived omega-3-fatty acids EPA and DHA are indicated specifically for (a) adjuvant treatment in secondary prevention after myocardial infarction, in addition to other standard therapy (ie. statins, antiplatelet medicinal products, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors), and (b) as a supplement to diet when dietary measures alone are insufficient to produce an adequate response, particularly with type IV hypertriglyceridemia in monotherapy or type IIb/III in combination with statins, when control of triglycerides is insufficient [L2661]. In addition, prescribing information for EMA approved fish oil pharmaceuticals are also indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce very high (>=500 mg/dL) triglyceride levels in adult patients, much like similar FDA approved indications [F37, FDA Label].', 'The specific mechanism of action by which the fish oil EPA and DHA acids are capable of reducing serum triglyceride levels is not yet fully understood [FDA Label, A32933]. Nevertheless, it is proposed that such omega-3-fatty acids may not be the preferred substrates of the enzyme diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase that participates in the generation of triglycerides; that  they might interact with nuclear transcription factors that manage lipogenesis; or that their presence and increase in levels can cause cellular metabolism to subsequently shift toward a decrease in triglyceride synthesis and an increase in fatty acid oxidation [A32933]. Moreover, the EPA and DHA acids are also believed to be able to promote apolipoprotein B degradation in the liver through the stimulation of an autophagic process [A32933]. It may also be possible that these fish oil acids can accelerate the clearance of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles and chylomicron [A32933]. The combination of all these actions results in fewer VLDL particles being assembled and secreted, which is of considerable importance as VLDL particles are the major endogenous source of triglycerides [A32933].



Moreover, new paradigms of how inflammation is contained and dissipated involve various newly discovered chemical mediators, resolvins, and protectins [A32933]. Such agents are believed to be directly involved in blocking neutrophil migration, infiltration, recruitment, as well as blocking T-cell migration and promoting T-cell apoptosis [A32933]. Additionally, such protectins can also reduce tumor necrosis factor and interferon secretion [A32933]. Of particular importance, however, is the fact that protectins and resolvins are exclusively derived from omega-3-fatty acids and that EPA is the substrate of the resolvins family and DHA can be converted to both resolvins and protectins [A32933]. It is believed that these effects of such fish oil acids underlie the actions that fish oil have demonstrated on eliciting stability for vulnerable inflammatory plaques [A32933].



Finally, fish oil acids have demonstrated certain direct electrophysiological effects on the myocardium [A32933]. In animal studies, it was shown that the ventricular fibrillation threshold could be increased in both animals fed or infused with omega-3-fatty acids [A32933]. Further studies subsequently revealed that such fatty acids could reduce both sodium currents and L-type calcium currents on a cellular and ion channel level [A32933]. It is consequently hypothesized that during ischemia, a reduction in the sodium ion current protects hyperexcitable tissue, and a reduction in the calcium ion current could reduce arrhythmogenic depolarizing currents - and that perhaps the use of EPA and DHA fish oil acids could facilitate such activity [A32933]. For the time being, however, omega-3-fatty acids in pharmaceutical supplement form have not been shown to elicit such protection against heart conditions [L2662].', 'In general, the only practical method of obtaining and increasing the levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) fish oil omega-3-fatty acids in the body is to consume them directly from foods and/or dietary supplements [L784]. Having EPA and DHA is important because they facilitate numerous important functions in the human body. As an example, such supplementation of fish oil EPA and DHA demonstrates a legitimate ability to decrease triglyceride levels as their presence in the body can act as poor substrates for the enzymes that are ordinarily responsible for triglyceride synthesis and also inhibit the esterification of other fatty acids, among other mechanisms [FDA Label, L2661].



Moreover, such fish oil acids can become important components of the phospholipids that form the structures of cell membranes [L784]. Specifically, DHA is particularly high in the retina, brain, and sperm [L784]. Additionally, these acids also provide energy for the body and are used to form eicosanoids - signaling molecules that have similar chemical structures to the fish oil fatty acids from which they are derived [L784]. Furthermore, such eicosanoids possess wide-ranging functions in the cardiovascular, pulmonary, immune, and endocrine systems [L784].', 'DrugBank');

DNA gyrase is an enzyme found only in bacteria that introduces negative supercoils into DNA during replication - this helps to relieve torsional strain caused by the introduction of positive supercoils during replication, and these negative supercoils are essential for chromosome condensation and the promotion of transcription initiation.[A31453] It is comprised of four subunits (two A subunits and two B subunits) of which the A subunits appear to be the target of fluoroquinolone antibiotics.[A190663] Bacterial topoisomerase IV, in addition to contributing to the relaxation of positive supercoils, is essential at the terminal stages of DNA replication and functions to “unlink” newly replicated chromosomes to allow for the completion of cell division.[A31453]



Inhibition of these enzymes by levofloxacin likely occurs via complexation with the topoisomerase enzymes.[A31453] The end result is a blockade of DNA replication, thus inhibiting cell division and resulting in cell death.', 'Levofloxacin is bactericidal and exerts its antimicrobial effects via inhibition of bacterial DNA replication.[L11638] It has a relatively long duration of action in comparison with other antibiotics that allows for once or twice daily dosing.

Benzodiazepines bind to the benzodiazepine site on GABA-A receptors, which potentiates the effects of GABA by increasing the frequency of chloride channel opening.[F2434] These receptors have been identified in different body tissues including the heart and skeletal muscle, although mainly appear to be present in the central nervous system.[A173842]', '**General effects**



Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine central nervous system (CNS) depressant. Pharmacodynamic properties of midazolam and its metabolites, which are similar to those of other benzodiazepine drugs, include sedative, anxiolytic, amnestic, muscle relaxant, as well as hypnotic activities.[F2434] Benzodiazepines enhance the inhibitory action of the amino acid neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).  Receptors for GABA are targeted by many important drugs that affect GABA function and are commonly used in the treatment of anxiety disorder, epilepsy, insomnia, spasticity, and aggressive behavior.[A173854]



**Sedation and memory**



The onset of sedation after intramuscular administration in adults is 15 minutes, with maximal sedation occurring 30-60 minutes after injection.[FDA label] In one study of adults, when tested the following day, 73% of the patients who were administered midazolam intramuscularly had no recollection of memory cards shown 30 minutes following drug administration; 40% had no recollection of the memory cards shown 60 minutes after drug administration. Onset time of sedative effects in pediatric patients begins within 5 minutes and peaks at 15-30 minutes depending upon the dose administered. In the pediatric population, up to 85% had no memory of pictures shown after receiving intramuscular midazolam compared to 5% of the placebo control group.[F2434]



Sedation in both adult and pediatric patients is reached within 3 to 5 minutes post intravenous (IV) injection. The time of onset is affected by the dose administered and the simultaneous administration of narcotic pre-medication. Seventy-one (71%) percent of the adult patients in clinical endoscopy studies had no memory of insertion of the endoscope; 82% of the patients had no memory of withdrawal of the endoscope.[L12981]



**Anesthesia induction**



When midazolam is administered intravenously (IV) for anesthetic induction, induction of anesthesia occurs in about 1.5 minutes when narcotic pre-medication has been given and in 2 to 2.5 minutes without narcotic pre-medication/ other sedative pre-medication. Impairment in a memory test was observed in 90% of the patients.[L12981]', 'DrugBank');

As such, repaglinide is more effective at reducing postprandial blood glucose levels than fasting blood glucose levels and requires a longer duration of therapy (approximately one month) before decreases in fasting blood glucose are observed. The insulinotropic effects of repaglinide are highest at intermediate glucose levels (3 to 10 mmol/L) and it does not increase insulin release already stimulated by high glucose concentrations (greater than 15 mmol/L).

High concentrations of ATP inhibit ATP-sensitive potassium channels causing membrane depolarization. When extracellular glucose concentrations are low, ATP-sensitive potassium channels open causing membrane repolarization. High glucose concentrations cause ATP-sensitive potassium channels to close resulting in membrane depolarization and opening of L-type calcium channels. The influx of calcium ions stimulates calcium-dependent exocytosis of insulin granules. Repaglinide increases insulin release by inhibiting ATP-sensitive potassium channels in a glucose-dependent manner. ', 'DrugBank');

Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), in the regular tablet form (immediate-release), is indicated to relieve pain, fever, and inflammation associated with many conditions, including the flu, the common cold, neck and back pain, dysmenorrhea, headache, tooth pain, sprains, fractures, myositis, neuralgia, synovitis, arthritis, bursitis, burns, and various injuries. It is also used for symptomatic pain relief after surgical and dental procedures [FDA label]. 



The _extra strength_ formulation of acetylsalicylic acid is also indicated for the management migraine pain with photophobia (sensitivity to light) and phonophobia (sensitivity to sound)[FDA label].



**Other indications**



ASA is also indicated for various other purposes, due to its ability to inhibit platelet aggregation. These include: 



Reducing the risk of cardiovascular death in suspected cases of myocardial infarction (MI) [FDA label]. 



Reducing the risk of a first non-fatal myocardial infarction in patients, and for reducing the risk of morbidity and mortality in cases of unstable angina and in those who have had a prior myocardial infarction [FDA label].



For reducing the risk of transient ischemic attacks (TIA) and to prevent atherothrombotic cerebral infarction (in conjunction with other treatments) [FDA label].



For the prevention of thromboembolism after hip replacement surgery [FDA label]. 



For decreasing platelet to platelet adhesion following carotid endarterectomy, aiding in the prevention of transient ischemic attacks (TIA) [FDA label].



Used for patients undergoing hemodialysis with a silicone rubber arteriovenous cannula inserted to prevent thrombosis at the insertion site [FDA Label]. 



**Important note regarding use of the extended-release formulation [F4405]**



In the setting of acute myocardial infarction, or before percutaneous interventions, the extended-release form of acetylsalicylic acid should not be used. Use immediate-release formulations in scenarios requiring rapid onset of action [Label, F4405]. The extended-release form is taken to decrease the incidence of mortality and myocardial infarction (MI) for individuals diagnosed with chronic coronary artery disease (CAD), including patients with previous myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina or with chronic stable angina. Additionally, the extended-release form is used to decrease the risk of death and recurrent episodes of stroke in patients with a history of stroke or TIA [F4405].





 ', 'Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) blocks prostaglandin synthesis. It is non-selective for COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes [A177241, A10989, A32682]. Inhibition of COX-1 results in the inhibition of platelet aggregation for about 7-10 days (average platelet lifespan). The acetyl group of acetylsalicylic acid binds with a serine residue of the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) enzyme, leading to irreversible inhibition. This prevents the production of pain-causing prostaglandins. This process also stops the conversion of arachidonic acid to thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which is a potent inducer of platelet aggregation [FDA label].  Platelet aggregation can result in clots and harmful venous and arterial thromboembolism, leading to conditions such as pulmonary embolism and stroke. 



It is important to note that there is 60% homology between the protein structures of COX-1 and COX-2. ASA binds to serine 516 residue on the active site of COX-2 in the same fashion as its binding to the serine 530 residue located on the active site of COX-1. The active site of COX-2 is, however, slightly larger than the active site of COX-1, so that arachidonic acid (which later becomes prostaglandins) manages to bypass the aspirin molecule inactivating COX-2 [A32682, A177256].  ASA, therefore, exerts more action on the COX-1 receptor rather than on the COX-2 receptor [A177268]. A higher dose of acetylsalicylic acid is required for COX-2 inhibition [A177325]. ', '**Effects on pain and fever**



Acetylsalicylic acid disrupts the production of prostaglandins throughout the body by targeting cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) [A177241, A10989, A32682]. Prostaglandins are potent, irritating substances that have been shown to cause headaches and pain upon injection into humans.  Prostaglandins increase the sensitivity of pain receptors and substances such as histamine and bradykinin. Through the disruption of the production and prevention of release of prostaglandins in inflammation, this drug may stop their action at pain receptors, preventing symptoms of pain. Acetylsalicylic acid is considered an antipyretic agent because of its ability to interfere with the production of brain prostaglandin E1. Prostaglandin E1 is known to be an extremely powerful fever-inducing agent [FDA label]. 



**Effects on platelet aggregation**



The inhibition of platelet aggregation by ASA occurs because of its interference with thromboxane A2 in platelets, caused by COX-1 inhibition. Thromboxane A2 is an important lipid responsible for platelet aggregation, which can lead to clot formation and future risk of heart attack or stroke  [FDA label]. 



**A note on cancer prevention**



ASA has been studied in recent years to determine its effect on the prevention of various malignancies [A177325]. In general, acetylsalicylic acid is involved in the interference of various cancer signaling pathways, sometimes inducing or upregulating tumor suppressor genes [A177325, A177403]. Results of various studies suggest that there are beneficial effects of long-term ASA use in the prevention of several types of cancer, including stomach, colorectal, pancreatic, and liver cancers [A177400].

It is also utilized for boosting the immune system, treating the common cold and recurrent ear infections, as well as preventing lower respiratory tract infections [L2172].  



', '**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].



Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].



In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].



There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].



Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].



The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. 



In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].



In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].



The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].', 'Zinc is involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of human proteins may bind zinc, in addition to hundreds of proteins that transport and traffic zinc. It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is an essential element for a proper sense of taste and smell and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations [L2211].



Studies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions [L2095]:



**Colds:** Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently [L2095].



**Wound healing:** Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements [L2095]. 



**Diahrrea**: Oral zinc supplements can reduce the symptoms of diarrhea in children with low levels of zinc, especially in cases of malnutrition [L2095].

Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]', 'Atorvastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A177388,A181421] Atorvastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, which increases hepatic uptake of LDL. Atorvastatin also reduces Very-Low-Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol (VLDL-C), serum triglycerides (TG) and Intermediate Density Lipoproteins (IDL), as well as the number of apolipoprotein B (apo B) containing particles, but increases High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C). 



_In vitro_ and _in vivo_ animal studies also demonstrate that atorvastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] These effects include improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response. Statins were also found to bind allosterically to β2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an essential role in leukocyte trafficking and T cell activation.[A181559]', 'Atorvastatin is an oral antilipemic agent that reversibly inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. It lowers total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apo B), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease, and high ratios are associated with a higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, atorvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A174580,A181087,A181406,A181925] 



Elevated cholesterol levels (and high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in particular) are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Clinical studies have shown that atorvastatin reduces LDL-C and total cholesterol by 36-53%.[A177415] In patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia, atorvastatin reduced the levels of intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol.[A177397] It has also been suggested that atorvastatin can limit the extent of angiogenesis, which can be useful in the treatment of chronic subdural hematoma.[A177388]



**Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis**



Atorvastatin, like other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, is associated with a risk of drug-induced myopathy characterized by muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness in conjunction with elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK). Myopathy often manifests as rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria. The risk of statin-induced myopathy is dose-related, and the symptoms of myopathy are typically resolved upon drug discontinuation. Results from observational studies suggest that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]



**Liver Dysfunction**



Statins, like some other lipid-lowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (> 3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] occurring on two or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin in clinical trials. This effect appears to be dose-related.[F4670,F4673]



**Endocrine Effects**



Statins are associated with a risk of increased serum HbA1c and glucose levels. An _in vitro_ study demonstrated a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on human pancreatic islet β cells following treatment with atorvastatin. Moreover, insulin secretion rates decreased relative to control.[A182012]



HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and may theoretically interfere with the production of adrenal and/or gonadal steroids. Clinical studies with atorvastatin and other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have suggested that these agents do not affect plasma cortisol concentrations, basal plasma testosterone concentration, or adrenal reserve. However, the effect of statins on male fertility has not been fully investigated. The effects of statins on the pituitary-gonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown.[F4673]



**Cardiovascular**



Significant decreases in circulating ubiquinone levels in patients treated with atorvastatin and other statins have been observed. The clinical significance of a potential long-term statin-induced deficiency of ubiquinone has not been established. It has been reported that a decrease in myocardial ubiquinone levels could lead to impaired cardiac function in patients with borderline congestive heart failure.[F4673]



**Lipoprotein A**



In some patients, the beneficial effect of lowered total cholesterol and LDL-C levels may be partly blunted by the concomitant increase in Lp(a) lipoprotein concentrations. Present knowledge suggests the importance of high Lp(a) levels as an emerging risk factor for coronary heart disease.[F4673] Further studies have demonstrated statins affect Lp(a) levels differently in patients with dyslipidemia depending on their apo(a) phenotype; statins increase Lp(a) levels exclusively in patients with the low molecular weight apo(a) phenotype.[A181418]', 'DrugBank');

These inflammatory cytokines work by modulating gene expression downstream of receptor signalling,[A180712] regulating Th2 cell differentiation, and activating inflammatory cells such as mast cells and macrophages.[A181274] 



There are two types of receptors for IL-4: the type 1 receptor, which is composed of the IL-4 chain (IL-4Rα) and a γ chain (γC), and the type 2 receptor, which is composed of the IL-4Rα chain and the α1 chain of the IL-13 receptor (IL-13Rα1).[A180709] Essentially, IL‐4Rα is a component shared by the IL‐4 and IL-13 receptor complexes [A180478] and is ubiquitously expressed on both innate and adaptive immune cells to promote the signaling of IL-4 and IL-13.[A181274] The type I receptor is primarily expressed on lymphocytes and controls Th2-cell differentiation, whereas the type II receptor is mostly found across resident and myeloid cells.[A18874] Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against IL‐4Rα to inhibit the signalling of IL‐4 and IL‐13.[A180712] Dupilumab inhibits IL-4 signalling via the Type I receptor (IL-4Rα/γc), and both IL-4 and IL-13 signaling through the Type II receptor (IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα).[L7192] It ultimately downregulates type-2 immunity.[A180709]', 'Dupilumab is an recombinant human IgG4 antibody to the IL-4 receptor that works by inhibiting the activation of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines that are implicated in the pathophysiology of several allergic and atopic conditions, including asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and food and environmental allergies. _In vivo_, dupilumab was shown to reduce the levels of type 2 inflammatory biomarkers associated with atopic dermatitis, such as thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC/CCL17), total serum IgE, allergen-specific IgE, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). A decrease in the levels of biomarkers of asthma, such as FeNO, eotaxin-3, IgE, periostin, and eotaxin-3 (CCL26) was also observed.[L7192,L7225] Since dupilumab works to suppress the immune response, it is proposed that it may influence the immune response against some infections, such as helminth infections, by inhibiting IL-4/IL-13 signaling. It is advised that infections are appropriately treated until resolved before initiating dupilumab therapy.[L7192] 



While findings of some _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ studies suggest that some cytokine modulators may influence the expression and activity of specific cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes, an open-label drug-drug interaction study demonstrated that dupilumab displays no significant effect on the activity of CYP450 enzymes studied (CYP3A, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP1A2, and CYP2D6).[A180712]', 'DrugBank');

These inflammatory cytokines work by modulating gene expression downstream of receptor signalling,[A180712] regulating Th2 cell differentiation, and activating inflammatory cells such as mast cells and macrophages.[A181274] 



There are two types of receptors for IL-4: the type 1 receptor, which is composed of the IL-4 chain (IL-4Rα) and a γ chain (γC), and the type 2 receptor, which is composed of the IL-4Rα chain and the α1 chain of the IL-13 receptor (IL-13Rα1).[A180709] Essentially, IL‐4Rα is a component shared by the IL‐4 and IL-13 receptor complexes [A180478] and is ubiquitously expressed on both innate and adaptive immune cells to promote the signaling of IL-4 and IL-13.[A181274] The type I receptor is primarily expressed on lymphocytes and controls Th2-cell differentiation, whereas the type II receptor is mostly found across resident and myeloid cells.[A18874] Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against IL‐4Rα to inhibit the signalling of IL‐4 and IL‐13.[A180712] Dupilumab inhibits IL-4 signalling via the Type I receptor (IL-4Rα/γc), and both IL-4 and IL-13 signaling through the Type II receptor (IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα).[L7192] It ultimately downregulates type-2 immunity.[A180709]', 'Dupilumab is an recombinant human IgG4 antibody to the IL-4 receptor that works by inhibiting the activation of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines that are implicated in the pathophysiology of several allergic and atopic conditions, including asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and food and environmental allergies. _In vivo_, dupilumab was shown to reduce the levels of type 2 inflammatory biomarkers associated with atopic dermatitis, such as thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC/CCL17), total serum IgE, allergen-specific IgE, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). A decrease in the levels of biomarkers of asthma, such as FeNO, eotaxin-3, IgE, periostin, and eotaxin-3 (CCL26) was also observed.[L7192,L7225] Since dupilumab works to suppress the immune response, it is proposed that it may influence the immune response against some infections, such as helminth infections, by inhibiting IL-4/IL-13 signaling. It is advised that infections are appropriately treated until resolved before initiating dupilumab therapy.[L7192] 



While findings of some _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ studies suggest that some cytokine modulators may influence the expression and activity of specific cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes, an open-label drug-drug interaction study demonstrated that dupilumab displays no significant effect on the activity of CYP450 enzymes studied (CYP3A, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP1A2, and CYP2D6).[A180712]', 'DrugBank');

Pharyngitis/tonsillitis caused by _Streptococcus pyogenes_ as an alternative to first-line therapy in individuals who cannot use first-line therapy.', 'In order to replicate, bacteria require a specific process of protein synthesis, enabled by ribosomal proteins [A6505]. Azithromycin binds to the 23S rRNA of the bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit. It stops bacterial protein synthesis by inhibiting the transpeptidation/translocation step of protein synthesis and by inhibiting the assembly of the 50S ribosomal subunit [FDA label], [A14179]. This results in the control of various bacterial infections [A174193], [FDA label].   The strong affinity of macrolides, including azithromycin, for bacterial ribosomes, is consistent with their broad‐spectrum antibacterial activities [A174193].





Azithromycin is highly stable at a low pH, giving it a longer serum half-life and increasing its concentrations in tissues compared to erythromycin [A174175].
