By inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol within the liver, statins lower abnormal cholesterol and lipid levels and ultimately reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid. This is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Pitavastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] Increasing use of the statin class of drugs is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, [rosuvastatin] is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg [rosuvastatin] per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels.[A181409,A181535,A181538,A1793] Study data has confirmed that pitavastatin''s potency in lowering LDL-C is comparable to that of other statins but also has increased efficacy in increasing HDL-C (also known as "good cholesterol").[A182000,A182003,A182006] Despite these differences in potency, several trials have demonstrated only minimal differences in terms of clinical outcomes between statins.[A181538, A181427]','["C10AA08"]','[]'),(21116,'Aaa','ششش','55','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',809,'2022-05-31',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(21117,'Jacy topical cream 50 gm','جاكي كريم 50 جم','78','','Healing topical','','Healthy group for cosmetics > sabshire pharmaceuticals','Cream','كريم','50 gm','1','علاج للجلد الملتهب والحروق.','intense fast healing for minor to severly damaged skin plus hard to heal skin irritations. helps heal cuts scrapes rashes and burns.','','',2204,'2022-07-24',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(21118,'Jadenu 180mg 30 f.c. tabs.','جادينو 180 مجم 30 قرص','4,640','3680','Iron chelating agents','Deferasirox','Novartis','Tab','أقراص','180mg','3','','about deferasirox a synthetic achiral tridentate triazole derived from salicylic acid oral iron chelating agents. indication for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions (transfusional hemosiderosis) in patients 2 years of age and','','',1509,'2024-06-04',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Deferasirox is an iron chelator and the first oral medication FDA approved for chronic iron overload in patients receiving long term blood transfusions.','["V03AC03"]','[]'),(21119,'Jadenu 360mg 30 f.c. tabs.','جادينو 360مجم 30 قرص','8,685','7000','Iron chelating agents','Deferasirox','Novartis','Tab','أقراص','360mg','3','علاج نقص الحديد في الدم في حالة النزيف المتكرر او حالة العميات الجراحية المتكررة','about deferasirox a synthetic achiral tridentate triazole derived from salicylic acid oral iron chelating agents. indication for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions (transfusional hemosiderosis) in patients 2 years of age and','','',5953,'2024-06-03',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Deferasirox is an iron chelator and the first oral medication FDA approved for chronic iron overload in patients receiving long term blood transfusions.','["V03AC03"]','[]'),(21120,'Jadenu 90mg 30 f.c. tabs.','جادينو 90 مجم 30 قرص','2,025','','Iron chelating agents','Deferasirox','Novartis','Tab','أقراص','90mg','3','','about deferasirox a synthetic achiral tridentate triazole derived from salicylic acid oral iron chelating agents. indication for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions (transfusional hemosiderosis) in patients 2 years of age and','','',1181,'2022-07-24',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Deferasirox is an iron chelator and the first oral medication FDA approved for chronic iron overload in patients receiving long term blood transfusions.','["V03AC03"]','[]'),(21121,'Jadozolid 100mg/5ml susp 60 ml','جادوزوليد 100 مجم / 5 مل معلق 60 مل','23','','Antibiotic.oxazolidinone','Linezolid','Kahira > beta pharma-egypt','Susp','معلق','100mg','1','','about linezolid oxazolidinone derivative reversible nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitor antibiotic. mechanism of action of linezolid linezolid binds to the 23 s fraction of 50 s ribosome and inhibit the formation of 70s initiation complex. indication','','',839,'2022-07-27',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Linezolid is a synthetic antibiotic which is used for the treatment of infections caused by aerobic Gram-positive bacteria.

Empagliflozin was further approved by the EMA in March 2022 and Health Canada in April 2022, making it the first and only approved treatment in Europe and Canada for adults with symptomatic chronic heart failure regardless of ejection fraction.[L40783,L13916]','["A10BD19", "A10BD20", "A10BK03", "A10BD27"]','[]');

Metformin is considered an antihyperglycemic drug because it lowers blood glucose concentrations in type II diabetes without causing hypoglycemia. It is commonly described as an "insulin sensitizer", leading to a decrease in insulin resistance and a clinically significant reduction of plasma fasting insulin levels.[A176173] Another well-known benefit of this drug is modest weight loss, making it an effective choice for obese patients type II diabetes.[A36559]

It is marketed under the name DAKLINZA and is contained in daily oral tablets as the hydrochloride salt form . Hepatitis C is an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients [L852]. Daclatasvir was the first drug with demonstrated safety and therapeutic efficacy in treating HCV genotype 3 without the need for co-administration of interferon or [DB00811]. It exerts its antiviral action by preventing RNA replication and virion assembly via binding to NS5A, a nonstructural phosphoprotein encoded by HCV. Binding to the N-terminus of the D1 domain of NS5A prevents its interaction with host cell proteins and membranes required for virion replication complex assembly. Daclatasvir is shown to target both the cis- and trans-acting functions of NS5A and disrupts the function of new HCV replication complexes by modulating the NS5A phosphorylation status [A19640]. The most common critical NS5A amino acid substitutions that led to reduced susceptibility to daclatasvir therapy occured at position Q30 (Q30H/K/R) and M28 in genotype 1a patients and Y93H in genotype 3 patients. 

According to 2017 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), 60mg of daclatasvir is recommended with 400mg [DB08934] for genotype 1a/b patients with or without cirrhosis as second-line therapy. The same dosing regimen can be used as first-line therapy in patients with genotype 3 without cirrhosis and second-line therapy in genotype 3 patients with compensated cirrhosis. Combination therapies that include daclatasir can be used for challenging-to-treat patients who have HIV-1 coinfection, advanced cirrhosis, or post-liver transplant recurrence of HCV [L863]. The therapy is intended to cure or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR12), after 12 weeks of daily therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality [A19626]. 

Daclatasvir was FDA-approved in July 2015 for use with [DB08934] (Sovaldi) with or without [DB00811] to treat HCV genotype 1 and 3 infections. The SVR12 in HCV genotype 1a-infected treatment-naïve subjects without and with cirrhosis undergoing daclatasvir and [DB08934] therapy were 88% and 99%, respectively [FDA Label]. The same dosing regimen in treatment-naïve patients with HCV genotype 3 infection with or without cirrhosis achieved SVR12 rates of 71% and 98%, respectively [FDA Label].','["J05AP58", "J05AP07"]','[]'),(21150,'Je t-aime hair oil 100 ml','جوتيم زيت شعر 100 مل','74','','Hair care','Snake oil+jojoba oil+lavender oil+olive oil+rosemary oil+peppermint oil+eruca oil+vit.e+paraffin oil','Egyptian co. for cosmetics > new pharm','Hair oil','زيت شعر','100 ml','1','','** special hair care oil containing effective ingredients ** use: - bath oil: apply oil in warm water about 3 min. then apply on hair and leave it about 3-5 min. then rinse shampoo. - normal: leave oil on your hair about 15-30 min. then rinse shampoo.','','',329,'2022-08-06',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(21151,'Jectacortin 8mg/2ml amp. for i.m./i.v. inj.','جيكتاكورتين 8 مجم / 2 مل امبول','12','','Glucocorticoid','Dexamethasone sodium phosphate','Eimc','Inj','حقن','8mg','1','','','','',1539,'2022-07-13',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Dexamethasone, or MK-125, is a corticosteroid fluorinated at position 9 used to treat endocrine, rheumatic, collagen, dermatologic, allergic, ophthalmic, gastrointestinal, respiratory, hematologic, neoplastic, edematous, and other conditions.[L10701] Developed in 1957, it is structurally similar to other corticosteroids like [hydrocortisone] and [prednisolone].[A188724]

More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Rosuvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [simvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] This is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than [atorvastatin]''s effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial[A181427] concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.

Rosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]','["C10BX10", "C10BX05", "C10BX07", "C10AA07", "A10BH52", "G01AE10", "C10BX13", "C10BX09", "C10BA09", "C10BX16", "C10BX17", "C10BX14", "C10BA06"]','[]'),(21206,'Aaa','ششش','29','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',753,'2022-07-24',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(21208,'Aaa','ششش','41','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',821,'2022-07-24',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(21209,'Justice antiseptic hand gel 100 ml','جاستس جل مطهر لليدين 100 مل','25','','Antiseptic','Ethyl alcohol 70%+chlorhexidine+vitamin e','El helou for perfumes & cosmetics > justice pharm','Gel','جل','100 ml','1','','composed of a blend of antiseptics has wide spectrum against fungi bacteria and viruses','','',706,'2022-07-18',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(21211,'Aaa','ششش','148','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','0','علاج القشرة -- علاج تساقط الشعر','','','',652,'2023-02-04',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(21212,'Juviex syrup 120 ml','جوفيكس شراب 120 مل','12','','Cough drugs','Guava leaves+tilia flower+fennel oil','Hochster pharmaceutical industries','Syrup','شراب','120 ml','1','','helps in improving respiratory functions','','',975,'2022-07-23',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(21213,'K1 apex 10mg 30 chewable tab.','ك1 ابيكس 10مجم 30 قرص مضغ','42','','Vitamin k','Vitamin k1','October pharma > multi-apex','Tab','أقراص','10mg','3','علاج انخفاض فيتامين ك, للتراجع عن آثار بعض الأدوية المميعة للدم مثل الوارفارين, لعلاج أو منع النزيف','about vitamin k fat soluble vitamin antihemorrhagic. mechanism of action of vitamin k phytonadione (vitamin k1) is a synthetic form of vitamin k and is lipid soluble. vitamin k acts as a cofactor in the synthesis of coagulation proteins;

Methyldopa works by binding to alpha(α)-2 adrenergic receptors as an agonist, leading to the inhibition of adrenergic neuronal outflow and reduction of vasoconstrictor adrenergic signals.[A1499] Methyldopa exists in two isomers D-α-methyldopa and L-α-methyldopa, which is the active form.[A232224]

First introduced in 1960 as an antihypertensive agent, methyldopa was considered to be useful in certain patient populations, such as pregnant women and patients with renal insufficiency. Since then, methyldopa was largely replaced by newer, better-tolerated antihypertensive agents;[A231784] however, it is still used as monotherapy [L32614] or in combination with [hydrochlorothiazide].[L32619] Methyldopa is also available as intravenous injection, which is used to manage hypertension when oral therapy is unfeasible and to treat hypertensive crisis.[L32624]','["C02AB01"]','[]'),(21221,'Aaa','ششش','17','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',828,'2022-07-27',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(21222,'Kahicaine 1% 50mg/5ml 3 amp.','كاهيكايين 1% 50 مجم / 5 مل 3 امبول','11','','Analgesic.local anesthetic','Lidocaine','Kahira','Amp','أمبول','1%','3','','indication for production of local or regional anesthesia by infiltration techniques such as percutaneous injection and intravenous regional anesthesia by peripheral nerve block techniques such as brachial plexus and intercostal and by central neural tech','','',764,'2022-07-25',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Ever since its discovery and availability for sale and use in the late 1940s, lidocaine has become an exceptionally commonly used medication [T583]. In particular, lidocaine''s principal mode of action in acting as a local anesthetic that numbs the sensations of tissues means the agent is indicated for facilitating local anesthesia for a large variety of surgical procedures [F4349, L5930, L5948]. It ultimately elicits its numbing activity by blocking sodium channels so that the neurons of local tissues that have the medication applied on are transiently incapable of signaling the brain regarding sensations [F4349, L5930, L5948]. In doing so, however, it can block or decrease muscle contractile, resulting in effects like vasodilation, hypotension, and irregular heart rate, among others [F4349, L5930, L5948]. As a result, lidocaine is also considered a class Ib anti-arrhythmic agent [L5930, L5948, F4468]. Nevertheless, lidocaine''s local anesthetic action sees its use in many medical situations or circumstances that may benefit from its action, including the treatment of premature ejaculation [A177625].

Regardless, lidocaine is currently available as a relatively non-expensive generic medication that is written for in millions of prescriptions internationally on a yearly basis.

More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Rosuvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [simvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] This is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than [atorvastatin]''s effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial[A181427] concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.

Rosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]','["C10BX10", "C10BX05", "C10BX07", "C10AA07", "A10BH52", "G01AE10", "C10BX13", "C10BX09", "C10BA09", "C10BX16", "C10BX17", "C10BX14", "C10BA06"]','[]'),(21556,'Lakotta post laser cream 50 gm','لاكوتا بوست ليزر كريم 50 جم','160','75','Healing topical','Chamomile+calendula+hyaluronic acid+honey+rosemary+aloe vera+sage oil+avocado oil+tea tree oil+glycerin+panthenol','Cosmopack > impact','Cream','كريم','50 gm','1','','use: apply thin layer of cream on the skin and rub gently until fully absorbed.','','',920,'2025-07-04',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(21557,'Lamazi collagen 10 sachets','لامازي كولاجين 10 اكياس','185','105','Antirheumatic.osteoarthritis.anabolic agents','Gelatin (collagen) hydrolysate+vitamin c','Nutrixia > eval pharma','Sachet','أكياس','','1','','for health joints use: 1 sachet in a glass add 100 ml of water stirr well till dissolve then drink daily for 3 months','','',1507,'2024-03-25',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(21558,'Lambroflam 100 mg 20 f.c. tab.','لامبروفلام 100مجم 20 قرص','23','','Nsaid.acetic acid derivatives','Aceclofenac','Egpi > pioneer pharmaceutical industries','Tab','أقراص','100 mg','2','','indications for aceclofenac : 1. ankylosing spondylitis 2. osteoarthritis 3. symptomatic treatment of pain and inflammation in post-traumatic pain 4. cervical pain 5. low back pain 6. acute gout half life: the mean plasma elimination half-life is 4 - 4.3','','',800,'2022-07-08',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'M01AB16',NULL),(21559,'Lamica calcium 20 pieces','لاميكا كالسيوم 20 قطعة','55','','Calcium supplement','Calcium citrate+vitamin d3+magnesium citrate','Brand international fsc > optima pharma','Piece','قطعة','','2','مكمل غذائي غني بالكالسيوم.','','','',857,'2022-05-21',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(21560,'Lamictal 100mg 30 tab.','لاميكتال 100مجم 30 قرص','226','146.5','Anti-epileptic.triazine','Lamotrigine','Glaxo smithkline','Tab','أقراص','100mg','3','','about lamotrigine phenyltriazine derivative anticonvulsant mood stabilizer. mechanism of action of lamotrigine lamotrigine prolongs the inactivated state of voltage sensitive neuronal sodium ion channel either by increasing the efflux or decreasing the in','5900008008280','',4641,'2024-10-22',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Lamotrigine is an antiepileptic drug belonging in the phenyltriazine class.

Dexlansoprazole is the R-enantiomer of [DB00448], which is composed of a racemic mixture of the R- and S-enantiomers. Compared to the older generation of PPIs (which includes [DB00213], [DB00338], and [DB00448]) [A178084], dexlansoprazole MR has a unique pharmacokinetic profile due to its delayed-release and dual-delivery release system. The active ingredient is released in two phases at different pH values and at different time points, resulting in two peak concentrations in the blood; 25% of the dose is released at pH 5.5 in the proximal duodenum, while the remaining 75% is released at pH 6.75 in the distal small intestine [A19567]. As a result, dexlansoprazole has a peak concentration within 1-2 hours after dosing and another within 4-5 hours [FDA Label]. Dexlansoprazole''s unique pharmacokinetics addresses limitations of the older generation PPIs including short plasma half-life, break-through symptoms, and need for meal-associated dosing [A19568]. These characteristics make dexlansoprazole a good option for people who struggle with adherence and strict dosage timing before meals[A178087, A19566]. 

Dexlansoprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects in the same way as other drugs in the PPI family by inhibiting the final step in gastric acid production. Dexlansoprazole targets the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme, which is involved in the secretion of hydrochloric acid through the exchange of H+ ions from the cytoplasm for K+ ions. Normally functioning (H+, K+)-ATPase stimulates hydrochloric acid secretion into the gastric lumen thereby increasing stomach acidity and lowering pH. Once absorbed into circulation, dexlansoprazole covalently binds to the sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells, which leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion. Despite dexlansoprazole''s unique pharmacokinetic profile, efficacy in management of GERD symptoms is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [DB00338], [DB00736], [DB00448], [DB00213], and [DB01129].

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as dexlansoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life [A177571]. PPIs such as dexlansoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes [A177577, A177580].

Lenvatinib also inhibits other RTKs that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4; the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), KIT, and RET. These receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) located in the cell membrane play a central role in the activation of signal transduction pathways involved in the normal regulation of cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis and differentiation, and in pathogenic angiogenesis, lymphogenesis, tumour growth and cancer progression. In particular, VEGF has been identified as a crucial regulator of both physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis and increased expression of VEGF is associated with a poor prognosis in many types of cancers.

Lenvatinib is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine (RAI)-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer.

These receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) located in the cell membrane play a central role in the activation of signal transduction pathways involved in the normal regulation of cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis and differentiation, and in pathogenic angiogenesis, lymphogenesis, tumour growth and cancer progression. In particular, VEGF has been identified as a crucial regulator of both physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis and increased expression of VEGF is associated with a poor prognosis in many types of cancers.

Insulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce or synthesize the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels.[A2358, A2359, A2360, A44] As a result, people with T1D rely primarily on exogenous forms of insulin, such as insulin detemir, to lower glucose levels in the blood.[A2358, A2359, A2360, A44] Insulin is also used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), another form of diabetes mellitus that is a slowly progressing metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors that promote chronically elevated blood sugar levels.[A2358, A2359, A2360, A44] Without treatment or improvement in non-pharmacological measures such as diet and exercise to lower blood glucose, high blood sugar eventually causes cellular resistance to endogenous insulin, and in the long term, damage to pancreatic islet cells.[A2358, A2359, A2360, A44] Insulin is typically prescribed later in the course of T2D, after several oral medications such as [DB00331], [DB01120], or [DB01261] have been tried, when sufficient damage has been caused to pancreatic cells that the body is no longer able to produce insulin on its own.[A2358, A2359, A2360, A44] 

Marketed as the brand name product Levemir, insulin detemir has a duration of action of 16-24 hours allowing for once-daily dosing, typically at bedtime.[A2358, A2359, A2360, A44] Due to its duration of action, Levemir is considered "basal insulin" as it provides low concentrations of background insulin that can keep blood sugar stable between meals or overnight.[A2358, A2359, A2360, A44] Basal insulin is often combined with short-acting "bolus insulin" such as [DB00046], [DB01309], and [DB01306] to provide higher doses of insulin required following meals.[A2358, A2359, A2360, A44] Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas'' production of endogenous insulin, with a goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia.[A2358, A2359, A2360, A44]

Insulin detemir is produced using recombinant DNA technology in yeast cells.[A2358, A2359, A2360, A44] This insulin analogue has a 14-C fatty acid, myristic acid, bound to the lysine amino acid at position B29. The myristoyl side chain increases self-association and albumin binding.[A2358, A2359, A2360, A44] This along with slow systemic absorption from the injection site prolongs distribution of the hormone into tissues and results in a long duration of action. [A2358, A2359, A2360, A44]

Without an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst.[A2358, A2359, A2360, A44] If left untreated, the body starts to break down fat, instead of glucose, for energy which results in a build-up of ketone acids in the blood and a syndrome called ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. In the long term, elevated blood sugar levels increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetic neuropathy.[A2358, A2359, A2360, A44]','["A10AE05"]','[]'),(21743,'Aaa','ششش','50','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','0','','','','',618,'2023-06-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(21744,'Aaa','ششش','111','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',744,'2023-06-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(21745,'Aaa','ششش','138','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','0','','','6223003203115','',836,'2023-06-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(21746,'Levepsy 100mg/ml syrup 120 ml','ليفبسي 100 مجم / مل شراب 120 مل','60','','Anti-epileptic.pyrrolidine','Levetiracetam','Eipico','Syrup','شراب','100mg','1','','about levetiracetam it is s-enantiomer of etiracetam. anticonvulsant medication used to treat epilepsy. mechanism of action of levetiracetam the exact mechanism for levetiracetam is unknown. however the drug binds to a synaptic vesicle protein sv2a which','','',765,'2022-07-20',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Levetiracetam is a drug within the pyrrolidine class that is used to treat various types of seizures stemming from epileptic disorders.

Overall, olmesartan''s physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium. 

Olmesartan also affects the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays an important role in hemostasis and regulation of kidney, vascular, and cardiac functions. Pharmacological blockade of RAAS via  AT1 receptor blockade inhibits negative regulatory feedback within RAAS, which is a contributing factor to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal disease. In particular, heart failure is associated with chronic activation of RAAS, leading to inappropriate fluid retention, vasoconstriction, and ultimately a further decline in left ventricular function. ARBs have been shown to have a protective effect on the heart by improving cardiac function, reducing afterload, increasing cardiac output and preventing ventricular hypertrophy and remodelling.[A174154] 

By comparison, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) class of medications (which includes drugs such as [ramipril], [lisinopril], and [perindopril]) inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II through inhibition of the ACE enzyme. However, this does not prevent the formation of all angiotensin II within the body.

Olmesartan is commonly used for the management of hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes-associated nephropathy, particularly in patients who are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors.
