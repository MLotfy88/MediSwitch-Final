The risk appears to be greatest with grepafloxacin and sparfloxacin (both are no longer marketed in the U.S.), although cardiovascular morbidity and mortality attributable to QT prolongation have also been reported rarely with others like gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin.  Reported cases have primarily occurred in patients with advanced age, cardiac disease, electrolyte disturbances, and/or underlying medical problems for which they were receiving concomitant medications known to prolong the QT interval.  Therapy with quinolones should be avoided in patients with known QT prolongation and/or uncorrected electrolyte disorders (hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia) and in patients treated concomitantly with class IA or III antiarrhythmic agents.  Cautious use with ECG monitoring is advised in patients with other proarrhythmic conditions such as clinically significant bradycardia, congestive heart failure, acute myocardial ischemia, and atrial fibrillation.  As QT prolongation may be a concentration-dependent effect, it is important that the recommended dosages or infusion rates of these drugs not be exceeded, particularly in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment.', '3', 'Jaillon P, Morganroth J, Brumpt I, Talbot G "Overview of electrocardiographic and cardiovascular safety data for sparfloxacin.
