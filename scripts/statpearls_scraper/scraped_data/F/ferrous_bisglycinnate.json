    "indications": "Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is a cytosolic \"housekeeping\" enzyme present in all cells that helps prevent damage from reactive oxygen species by generating substrates needed for antioxidative defenses. Erythrocytes are especially vulnerable to reactive oxygen species because they transport oxygen and, once mature, cannot replace damaged proteins. Inherited G6PD deficiency can therefore lead to acute hemolytic anemia during periods of increased oxidative stress.\n\nTriggers include infections, fava beans, and several medications. Antimalarials, in particular, are well known to precipitate hemolysis in affected patients.\n[1]\nThe Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium has provided a comprehensive, periodically updated list.\n[2]\nHigh- and medium-risk medications that have been associated with hemolytic crises in G6PD deficiency include:\n\nHigh-risk medications\nDapsone\nMethylene blue\nPegloticase\nPhenazopyridine\nPrimaquine (standard dosage)\nRasburicase\nTafenoquine\nToluidine blue\nMedium-risk medications\nNitrofurantoin\nPrimaquine (medium dosage)\n[2]",
    "mechanism": "The\nG6PD\ngene, located on the distal long arm of the X chromosome (Xq28), encodes G6PD, and therefore, pathogenic variants follow X-linked inheritance. The gene spans approximately 18 kb, with 13 exons, and produces a 515-amino-acid enzyme.\n[3]\nMost disease-causing variants are single-nucleotide missense mutations that result in deficient proteins; small deletions and other variant types are relatively uncommon. Hundreds of variants have been cataloged (well over 200 pathogenic or likely pathogenic, with many additional variants of uncertain significance reported in recent datasets).\n[1]\nComplete absence of G6PD activity appears incompatible with life, whereas near-null and severely destabilizing variants present as chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia rather than embryonic demise.\n[4]",
    "monitoring": "Newborn Evaluation\n\nVisual inspection alone provides an unreliable assessment of jaundice in newborns; clinicians should therefore obtain an objective bilirubin measurement, eg, total serum bilirubin (TSB), fractionated bilirubin, or transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB). Management should follow hour-specific thresholds outlined in the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) hyperbilirubinemia guideline. A TSB measurement should confirm TcB values that approach treatment thresholds, and all treatment decisions should rely on TSB results.\n\nThe AAP recommends that G6PD activity testing is indicated in newborns with jaundice of unknown cause, a rise in TSB despite intensive phototherapy, a sudden increase in TSB, a rebound in the TSB level after an initial decline, or when escalation of care becomes necessary. Universal newborn screening for G6PD deficiency is not advised in the United States; however, testing should occur when clinical presentation, ancestry, or family history raises suspicion.\n[15]\n\nThe fluorescent spot test is the most widely used qualitative screening method, but this study may fail to detect heterozygous females. When higher diagnostic precision is required, eg, in females, borderline enzyme activity, or research and policy settings, a quantitative enzyme assay should be performed, either spectrophotometric or through a validated quantitative point-of-care method.\n[16]\n[17]\n\nEvaluation of Older Children and Adults\n\nEvaluation of older children and adults should begin with a detailed medical history and physical examination, focusing on recent medication use, oxidant exposures, eg, fava beans, and infections. Laboratory findings during oxidant-induced hemolysis typically reveal declining hemoglobin, reticulocytosis, indirect hyperbilirubinemia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and decreased haptoglobin, often with a negative direct antiglobulin test. Peripheral smears may display bite and blister cells, while supravital staining demonstrates Heinz bodies. Confirmation requires a G6PD enzyme activity assay, and molecular testing may be indicated when clarification of the specific variant is needed.\n[18]\n[19]",
    "administration": "In neonatal patients, treatment focuses on managing jaundice and preventing kernicterus. This includes phototherapy based on standard published guidelines. In severe cases, an exchange transfusion may be necessary.\n[15]\nIn older patients, management depends primarily on the overall clinical picture. Less severe presentations may be managed with supportive care and the discontinuation or avoidance of offending agents. Infections should be treated as indicated by history and exam. More severe cases may require transfusions.\n[20]\n[21]\n\nThe optimal care for G6PD deficiency involves an interprofessional approach. Core team members include the pediatrician or internist, hematologist, pharmacist, nursing staff, and the clinical laboratory (for timely enzyme testing and interpretation). Genetics professionals (medical geneticist or genetic counselor) are valuable for variant counseling, carrier testing, especially in females, and family education.\n\nNewborn Management\n\nPriorities include early identification of hyperbilirubinemia, adherence to hour-specific AAP thresholds, prompt phototherapy when indicated, and escalation (eg, NICU transfer, possible exchange transfusion) for rapidly rising or treatment-refractory bilirubin levels. Clinicians should ensure a predischarge bilirubin measurement is performed, arrange time-bound follow-up, and educate caregivers about the warning signs of jaundice in neonates. G6PD activity testing should also be considered in neonatal jaundice that has an early onset, is severe, is poorly responsive to phototherapy, or occurs in infants with suggestive ancestry and family history.\n\nManagement in Children and Adults\n\nManagement strategies for children and adults with G6PD deficiency depend on the degree of clinical severity.\n\nMild to moderate episodes\n\nManagement focuses on eliminating or avoiding triggers, eg, oxidant medications, fava beans, and naphthalene, while treating concurrent infections. Supportive measures include adequate hydration, rest, and close monitoring of hemoglobin, reticulocyte count, bilirubin, LDH, and haptoglobin levels.\n\nIndividuals with severe hemolysis\n\nPatients with significant anemia may require packed red blood cell transfusion. Continuous monitoring for acute kidney injury through urine output and serum creatinine is essential, along with correction of electrolyte and acid–base disturbances. Hospitalization becomes necessary when clinical instability develops.\n\nSpecial scenarios\n\nMethylene blue must be avoided in suspected or confirmed G6PD deficiency when treating methemoglobinemia, as it can worsen hemolysis. Alternative treatments include high-flow oxygen, intravenous ascorbic acid, transfusion-based therapy, or hyperbaric oxygen in selected cases.\n\nMedication safety and stewardship\n\nPharmacists, working with prescribers, should review all current and new medications to identify agents with oxidant or hemolytic potential, eg, dapsone, rasburicase, pegloticase, primaquine, and tafenoquine. Caution is warranted with nitrofurantoin and phenazopyridine depending on the clinical context. Patients should receive an updated and accurate list of medications and substances to avoid, and their G6PD status should be clearly documented in the medical record.\n\nEducation and prevention\n\nNurses and clinicians should educate patients and families about recognizing symptoms of hemolysis, eg, dark urine, jaundice, fatigue, and pallor, emphasizing the importance of seeking urgent care when they occur. Counseling should include avoidance of triggers, including specific foods, chemicals, and drugs, and the need to inform all healthcare practitioners of G6PD status before initiating new treatments. Females should be informed about variable expression due to lyonization, which may justify quantitative testing even when qualitative screening appears normal.\n\nFollow-up management\n\nAfter resolution of an acute episode, clinicians should repeat a quantitative G6PD assay to confirm enzyme deficiency, as testing during hemolysis can yield false-normal results. The patient’s problem list and allergy section should be updated with “G6PD deficiency—risk of hemolysis.” Discharge instructions must include written guidance on avoidance strategies and arrangements for timely follow-up with primary care and hematology clinicians.",
    "adverse_effects": "In G6PD deficiency, complications cluster around hemolysis. Newborns are prone to significant hyperbilirubinemia with risk of kernicterus. Older patients can develop acute hemolytic anemia after oxidant stress (eg, drugs, infections, fava beans), occasionally with hemoglobinuria and acute kidney injury, and a small subset with severe variants experiences chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia."
