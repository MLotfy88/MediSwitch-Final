    "indications": "Gabapentin should not be prescribed to individuals with a history of allergic reactions to the drug or excipients.\n[44]\n[45]\n\nWarning and Precautions\n\nDRESS/multiorgan hypersensitivity:\nIn addressing Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), or multiorgan hypersensitivity, a reasonable strategy involves the cessation of gabapentin unless an alternate etiology can be definitively established. Notably, instances of severe, and in some cases fatal, multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions have been observed in conjunction with the utilization of gabapentin. Bullous pemphigoid has also been reported.\n[46]\n\nAnaphylaxis and angioedema:\nRapid intervention is important upon the presentation of anaphylaxis or angioedema, necessitating the immediate discontinuation of gabapentin. Such hypersensitivity reactions carry the potential for life-threatening consequences and warrant prompt medical evaluation and treatment.\n[47]\n\nDriving impairment, somnolence or sedation, and dizziness:\nA cautious approach advises individuals undergoing gabapentin treatment to exercise restraint in operating vehicles until they comprehensively understand the potential to impair driving capabilities. Notably, gabapentin has demonstrated the capacity to induce drowsiness, sedation, and dizziness.\n[48]\n\nIncreased seizure frequency:\nPrudent clinical practice underscores the avoidance of abrupt discontinuation of gabapentin, particularly among individuals with epilepsy, as this may engender an elevation in seizure frequency. Gradual dose tapering is advocated as a strategy to mitigate this inherent risk.\n\nRespiratory depression:\nA comprehensive understanding of gabapentin and central nervous system depressants, notably opioids, is critical, given the potential for developing profound respiratory depression. Individualized dosage adjustments are essential to managing this risk.\n[42]\n\nNeuropsychiatric adverse reactions (children aged 3 to 12):\nPediatric subjects aged 3 to 12 receiving gabapentin treatment for epilepsy warrant meticulous monitoring for potential neuropsychiatric sequelae, encompassing emotional lability, hostility, thought disorder, and hyperkinesia.\n\nWithdrawal seizures and status epilepticus:\nDiscontinuing antiepileptic drugs, including gabapentin, necessitates a gradual tapering regimen to prevent the risk of withdrawal-induced seizures or the emergence of status epilepticus.\n[49]",
    "mechanism": "Although the exact mechanism of action with the GABA receptors is unknown, researchers know that gabapentin freely passes the blood-brain barrier and acts on neurotransmitters. Gabapentin has a cyclohexyl group to the structure of the neurotransmitter GABA as a chemical structure. Although it has a structure similar to GABA, it does not bind to GABA receptors or influence the synthesis or uptake of GABA. Gabapentin works by showing a high affinity for binding sites throughout the brain corresponding to the presence of the voltage-gated calcium channels, especially α-2-δ-1, which seems to inhibit the release of excitatory neurotransmitters in the presynaptic area that participate in epileptogenesis.\n\nNo evidence exists for direct action at the serotonin, dopamine, benzodiazepine, or histamine receptors; research has shown gabapentin to increase total blood levels of serotonin in healthy control subjects.\n[33]\nGabapentin's mechanism in RLS is unclear, but it is known to bind strongly to α2δ-subunits of voltage-activated calcium channels. This binding likely inhibits calcium entry, normalizing neurotransmitter release, including excitatory glutamate; however, the precise mechanism remains unknown.\n\nPharmacokinetics\n\nAbsorption:\nIncreasing gabapentin's dosage leads to reduced bioavailability; for example, daily doses of 900 mg, 1200 mg, 2400 mg, 3600 mg, and 4800 mg yield bioavailability of approximately 60%, 47%, 34%, 33%, and 27%, respectively. The impact of food is minor, resulting in a 14% increase in area under the curve (AUC) and Cmax. The variable bioavailability of gabapentin may be due to transporter saturation at clinical doses. The limitations in oral absorption are overcome with the development of its prodrug, gabapentin enacarbil, transported via high-capacity sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (SMVT) and monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) in the intestine. The peak plasma concentration for gabapentin is 2 to 4 hours. The time to peak plasma concentration for gabapentin enacarbil is 5 hours for subjects in a fasting state and 7.3 hours for under-fed conditions.\n[14]\n\nDistribution:\nPlasma protein binding of gabapentin is less than 3%. The mean apparent volume of distribution is around 58±6 L. Gabapentin is highly lipophilic; cerebrospinal fluid concentrations in patients with epilepsy are approximately 20% of the corresponding levels found in plasma, highlighting its capacity to cross the blood-brain barrier.\n\nMetabolism:\nIn humans, gabapentin undergoes minimal metabolic alteration, largely retaining the original structure. Gabapentin does not induce or inhibit CYP enzymes. Also, none of the CYP enzyme inhibitors alter their pharmacokinetics. Gabapentin enacarbil undergoes substantial first-pass hydrolysis through non-specific carboxylesterase activity, primarily within enterocytes and, to a lesser degree, in hepatocytes. This process leads to the formation of gabapentin, carbon dioxide, acetaldehyde, and isobutyric acid.\n[34]\n\nElimination:\nSystemic elimination of gabapentin primarily occurs through renal excretion. The elimination half-life of gabapentin is 5 to 7 hours, and it takes 2 days for the body to eliminate gabapentin from its system. The elimination rate constant, as well as plasma and renal clearance, correlate directly with creatinine clearance. Reduced clearance of gabapentin is observed in older adults and those with renal dysfunction. Effective removal from plasma is achieved through hemodialysis. Gabapentin is a substrate of organic cation transporter type-2 (OCT2).\n[33]",
    "administration": "Available Dosage Forms and Strengths\n\nGabapentin is available in 2 forms—gabapentin immediate release and the prodrug gabapentin enacarbil. Gabapentin is available in tablet form with strengths of 600 mg and 800 mg, capsules in strengths of 100 mg, 300 mg, and 400 mg, as well as an oral solution of 250 mg/5mL. Gabapentin enacarbil is available in 300 mg extended-release tablets.\n[35]\n\nDosages\n\nInitial treatment with gabapentin typically begins with a dosage of 300 mg/d, which is gradually increased to 3 times daily, with a maximum dosage of 4800 mg/d. Healthcare providers recommend initiating the first dose in the evening and then taking the medication 3 times daily. The effects of gabapentin are usually noticeable within the first week of treatment, although significant improvement may take up to a month in some cases. When discontinuing the medication, it is advised to taper the dose over more than 7 days.\n\nPartial seizures:\nThe recommended dosage of gabapentin ranges from 300 to 1200 mg taken orally 3 times daily, with a maximum daily dosage of 3600 mg.\n\nPost-herpetic neuralgia:\nThe recommended dosage of gabapentin ranges from 300 to 600 mg taken orally 3 times daily, with a maximum daily dosage of 1800 mg.\n\nRestless legs syndrome (gabapentin enacarbil):\nThe recommended dosage of gabapentin enacarbil is 600 mg taken orally once daily, with a maximum daily dosage of 1800 mg.\n[5]\n\nNeuropathic pain:\nThe recommended gabapentin dosage ranges from 300 to 1200 mg taken orally 3 times daily, with a maximum daily dosage of 3600 mg.\n\nFibromyalgia:\nThe recommended gabapentin dosage is between 400 and 800 mg taken orally 3 times daily, with a maximum daily dosage of 2400 mg.\n\nSpecific Patient Populations\n\nHepatic impairment:\nThe American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) recognizes the potential role of gabapentin as a primary non-opioid therapeutic choice, particularly for managing neuropathic pain in patients with cirrhosis.\n[36]\n\nRenal impairment:\nFor patients with renal impairment, gabapentin, which is primarily excreted really and lacks active metabolites, requires dosage adjustment. Therefore, it is crucial to modify both the dose amount and frequency accordingly.\n\nCreatinine clearance of 30 mL/min to 60 mL/min: 200 mg to 700 mg twice per day\n\nCreatinine clearance of 16 mL/min to 29 mL/min: 200 mg to 700 mg once daily\n\nCreatinine clearance of 15 mL/min: 100 mg to 300 mg once daily\n\nCreatinine clearance of less than 15 mL/min on hemodialysis: 125 mg to 350 mg as a supplement dose post-hemodialysis\n\nPregnancy considerations:\nA cohort study utilizing the US Medicaid dataset investigated gabapentin exposure during pregnancy from January 2000 to December 2013. While no significant associations were observed with major malformations, multiple administration of gabapentin was correlated with an increase in the risk of cardiac defects. Late or dual exposure to gabapentin is linked to an increased risk of small for gestational age and preterm birth. Additionally, the risk of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission increased with higher drug exposure levels.\n[37]\n\nBreastfeeding considerations:\nLimited data suggest that maternal doses of gabapentin up to 2.1 g daily result in relatively low levels in infant serum. Administration of a single dose of 300 or 600 mg to mothers before cesarean section did not impact breastfeeding. It is advisable to monitor infants for drowsiness, sufficient weight gain, and developmental milestones, particularly in younger, exclusively breastfed infants and when combining anticonvulsant or psychotropic drugs.\n[38]\n\nPediatric patients:\nThe FDA has not approved gabapentin for treating partial seizures in pediatric patients aged 3 or younger. Gabapentin can be considered for pain relief in terminally ill children.\n[35]\n\nOlder patients:\nGiven the tendency for reduced renal function among older patients, careful consideration in dosing is advisable, with necessary adjustments as per creatinine clearance.",
    "adverse_effects": "Gabapentin may cause certain adverse effects, which are listed below.\n\nSevere reactions:\nThe severe adverse reactions include suicidality, depression, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, anaphylaxis, angioedema, erythema multiforme, rhabdomyolysis, and withdrawal seizure or withdrawal symptoms if the drug is discontinued abruptly.\n[39]\n\nMore common reactions:\nMore common reactions to gabapentin include ataxia, dizziness, fatigue, somnolence, fever, nystagmus, peripheral edema, hostility, hyperkinesia (in pediatric patients), nausea, vomiting, tremor, asthenia, diplopia, diarrhea, xerostomia, infection, amblyopia, headache, constipation, weight gain, abnormal thinking, amnesia, back pain, impotence, and depression.\n\nIn a study analyzing adverse drug reactions associated with gabapentin through the FDA Adverse Events Reporting System, it was found that compared to duloxetine, gabapentin showed a higher likelihood of drug withdrawal, auditory hallucinations, delusions, euphoric mood, ataxia, aggression, and substance use disorder.\n[40]\n\nDrug-Drug Interactions\n\nAntiepileptic drugs:\nAn important benefit of gabapentin is no interaction with valproate, lithium, and carbamazepine exists. However, concurrent use of gabapentin and pregabalin is contraindicated.\n[41]\n\nOpioids:\nReports of respiratory depression and sedation, occasionally fatal, have emerged with the coadministration of gabapentin and opioids like morphine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, and buprenorphine.\n[42]\n\nAntacids:\nConcurrent use of an antacid containing magnesium and aluminum hydroxides reduces gabapentin bioavailability. To mitigate this interaction, gabapentin is recommended at least 2 hours after administering the antacid.\n[43]\n\nDrug or laboratory test interactions:\nGabapentin's addition to other antiepileptic drugs might lead to false positive readings of urinary protein. Thus, the sulfosalicylic acid precipitation test is recommended to assess urine protein presence accurately.",
    "monitoring": "Clinicians should check baseline creatinine levels before and during the treatment. Patients should be informed and screened for depression, behavioral changes, and suicidality.\n[39]\n[50]\nBefore prescribing gabapentin or other pharmacotherapy, clinicians should check for iron deficiency, as it is associated with RLS.\n[51]",
    "toxicity": "At the federal level, gabapentin is not classified as a controlled substance, is regarded as a non-addictive medication, and is recognized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a potential substitute for opioids in managing chronic pain. However, growing concerns about the potential for misuse are increasing.\n[52]\nSeveral US states have moved gabapentin to the Schedule V controlled substance category. Gabapentin does not have a high risk of an overdose but can increase the euphoria caused by opioids and reduce drug withdrawals. An Australian study examined fatal gabapentinoid-related poisoning and discovered that concomitant other drug use is almost universal in such cases.\n[53]\nFurthermore, gabapentin can bypass the blocking effects of addiction treatment medications and, unfortunately, does not appear in urine drug tests.\n[54]\n\nGabapentin toxicity is seen in those with chronic kidney disease or undergoing hemodialysis, showing symptoms like tremors, altered mental states, and respiratory depression requiring intubation. Reports of rhabdomyolysis due to gabapentin have been described.\n[55]\n[56]\nNo antidote for gabapentin poisoning currently exists. Gabapentin can be removed through dialysis. The Extracorporeal Treatments in Poisoning (EXTRIP) workgroup recommends refraining from utilizing extracorporeal treatments (ECTR) and standard care for gabapentin poisoning in patients with normal kidney function. However, if reduced kidney function and coma necessitating mechanical ventilation are evident, the EXTRIP suggests incorporating ECTR and standard care.\n[57]"
