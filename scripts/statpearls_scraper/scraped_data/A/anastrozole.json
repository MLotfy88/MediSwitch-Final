    "indications": "Male factors are crucial contributors to infertility amongst infertile couples. The overall incidence of infertility accounts for nearly 15% of the total population. Male infertility in its most severe form is known as azoospermia. Azoospermia is defined as the complete absence of spermatozoa in 2 separate centrifuged semen specimens, while aspermia is the total lack of ejaculate. Azoospermia affects nearly 1% of the male population and about 10% to 15% of all males with infertility.\n[1]\n[2]\nMany untreatable testicular disorders result in azoospermia, the most severe form of male infertility.\n[3]\n\nAzoospermia can be subdivided into pre-testicular, testicular, or post-testicular causes (see\nTable 1.\nEtiologic Classification According to Pre-testicular, testicular, and Post-testicular Causes). Based on the presence or absence of obstruction of the ducts or vas deferens, azoospermia can be classified into obstructive azoospermia (OA) and nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA). It is essential to differentiate between Oa and NOA, ie, primary testicular failure. With advanced assisted reproductive technologies, various fertility options are available for couples having difficulties in conception due to male infertility, even azoospermia.\n\nAmongst azoospermic males, 40% will have OA.\n[4]\n[5]\nOA causes include congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens, obstruction of ejaculatory and epididymal ducts, atresia of the seminal vesicles, various infections of the genitourinary tract resulting in obstruction or pelvic and inguinal procedures leading to a complete blockage such as a bilateral vasectomy.\n[6]\n[7]\n\nIn OA, spermatogenesis is often normal. Therefore, treatment options for OA often include the surgical correction of the blockage in addition to other assisted reproductive techniques.\n\nThe majority of azoospermic men, about 60%, will have NOA, making it the most common type of azoospermia. NOA is most often due to severe defects in spermatogenesis, which are frequently due to primary testicular failure or dysfunction. It can also result from dysfunction of the pituitary or hypothalamus. The exact pathology of NOA is often idiopathic. Advanced assisted reproductive techniques can often treat NOA (primary testicular failure).\n[8]\n\nTesticular biopsies of patients suffering from severe spermatogenic failure often show various areas of normal spermatogenesis.\n[9]\nThese sperm can be retrieved using testicular sperm extraction (TESE) or testicular sperm aspiration (TESA) techniques and used in advanced assisted reproductive techniques such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Sperm retrieved from the testes in these ways and used for in vitro fertilization with ICSI generally results in healthy offspring.\n[10]\n[11]\n\nHealthcare professionals face many challenges in providing care to infertile men with spermatic failure. Diagnostic modalities used for patients with azoospermia are hormonal assessment, biomarkers in semen, ultrasonography, testicular biopsy, and vasography. The best tool for diagnosing distal male reproductive system obstruction is transrectal ultrasound.\n[12]\n[13]",
    "mechanism": "In OA, spermatogenesis is often normal. The exact pathology of NOA is often idiopathic.\n\nNOA may be due to several causes, including:\n[14]\n\nAnabolic steroid administration\nAndrogen insensitivity\nChemotherapy\nCongenital absence of germ cells (Sertoli cell-only syndrome)\nHeavy metal exposure\nHyperprolactinemia\nHypogonadotropic hypogonadism, as in Kallmann syndrome\nImpaired sperm production due to chromosomal abnormalities as in Klinefelter syndrome or Y chromosome microdeletions of subregions AZFa, AZFb, or AZFc\n[15]\nInfections such as mumps and orchitis\nRadiation therapy (Experimentally, epsilon aminocaproic acid has been shown to protect sperm DNA from radiation damage, but this has not yet been approved for clinical practice.)\n[16]\n[17]\nSpermatogenic (maturation) arrest\nTesticular torsion\nTestosterone supplementation therapy\nTranslocation or inversion of azoospermia factor cryptorchidism\nVaricoceles\n\nTable\nTable 1. Etiological Classification According to Pre-Testicular, Testicular, and Post-Testicular Causes.",
    "monitoring": "Semen Analysis\n\nAt least 2 separate analyses should be done with 3 days of sexual abstinence preceding each specimen. In patients with azoospermia who have normal ejaculate volume, there is either spermatogenic failure or obstruction between the testes and the seminal vesicles. Patients with azoospermia having low semen volume and normal-sized testicles may either have ejaculatory duct obstruction or ejaculatory dysfunction. Therefore, all patients displaying absent ejaculate (aspermia) or low-volume ejaculation (< 1.5 mL) should be requested to repeat the semen investigations and also give a post-ejaculation urine example.\n\nHormonal Evaluation\n\nIn evaluating azoospermia, especially with normal testicle size and consistency on physical examination, a detailed endocrinological evaluation is necessary to make a specific diagnosis and strategize the treatment protocol.\n[40]\nHormonal profiles, including testosterone level (total and free), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin, and estradiol levels, should be obtained in addition to a thyroid profile. There is usually a decreased or normal FSH level in patients with OA. In contrast, FSH levels are typically high in NOA, especially if the testes are below normal size. However, some overlap exists, so FSH levels alone may not be sufficient for differentiation. (As a general rule, the higher the FSH, the more likely a significant spermatogenic failure will be.) Thus, a testicular biopsy may need to be performed to make a definitive diagnosis. Fortunately, this is necessary for diagnosis infrequently.\n[41]\n\nHypogonadotropic hypogonadism is a relatively uncommon cause of NOA. It accounts for no more than 2% of all infertile males. Possible causes include Kallmann syndrome, androgen-induced hypogonadism (from testosterone supplementation), brain neoplasms, radiation, trauma, radiation, etc.\n[42]\nThe incidence of azoospermia from testosterone supplementation therapy is increasing as anabolic steroid abuse is increasing worldwide, and most patients and even many physicians are unaware or uninformed about the negative effects of testosterone therapy on sperm counts and spermatogenesis.\n[43]\n[44]\n[45]\n[46]\n\nImaging (Scrotal Ultrasonography\n)\n\nThe role of scrotal ultrasound in evaluating male infertility is evolving and becoming more routine. It allows for a more precise measurement of testicular size and can identify cysts, varicoceles, spermatoceles, and lesions that might not otherwise be detectable by other means. It can also help differentiate obstructive from NOA. Scrotal ultrasonography will tend to show ectasia of the epididymal tubules and/or the rete testis, abnormal epididymal echogenicity, or dilated proximal vas deferens in OA. Testicular volume, epididymal head size, and the resistive index of intratesticular vessels all tend to be increased compared to patients with NOA.\n[47]\nIn addition, transrectal ultrasonography can be used to evaluate the seminal vesicles and to screen for ejaculatory duct cysts. The absence of the seminal vesicles suggests a possible cystic fibrosis genetic mutation (CFTR). If the seminal vesicles are absent or dilated/enlarged, an obstructive etiology of azoospermia can be diagnosed.\n\nUltrasound examinations are painless and inexpensive, but a discussion with the diagnostic radiologist on which factors to look for and evaluate when a scrotal ultrasound is ordered for a male infertility patient will be very helpful. Therefore, the recommendation is for the routine use of a comprehensive sonographic evaluation to help diagnose azoospermia and differentiate obstructive from nonobstructive etiologies.\n\nGenetic Testin\ng\n\nKlinefelter Syndrome\n\nCytogenic abnormalities will be found in approximately 5% of men with NOA.\n[48]\nThe most common sex chromosomal abnormality is Klinefelter syndrome, which is the presence of an extra X chromosome (XXY). Patients are phenotypically male, and there is a highly variable clinical presentation. Many patients are unaware they have the condition until they present with infertility. It is believed that about 50% of all patients are never diagnosed. The overall incidence is about 1 in every 500 to 800 men, accounting for 3% of all infertile men. Klinefelter patients typically exhibit Sertoli cell-only syndrome on histological examination. Some of the characteristics of Klinefelter syndrome include the following:\n[49]\n\nTaller than average stature\nLonger legs, shorter torso, and broader hips compared to other boys\nPoor muscle tone\nPoor fine motor skills, dexterity, and coordination\nAbsent, delayed, or incomplete puberty\nAfter puberty, less muscle as well as less facial and body hair compared with other teens\nSmall, firm testicles\nSmall penis\nEnlarged breast tissue (gynecomastia)\nInfertility\n\nThe presence of germ cells and sperm is highly variable in these individuals. Microscopic testicular sperm extraction (micro-TESE) can retrieve viable sperm in 50% of men with Klinefelter syndrome.\n[50]\nThe data is conflicting on the use of age or testosterone levels to help predict successful sperm retrieval in men with this disorder.\n[51]\n[52]\n[53]\nSperm retrieval surgical procedures should be limited to adults and are not currently recommended in boys and adolescents with Klinefelter syndrome.\n[38]\n[54]\n\nAdult men with the syndrome also have high rates of hypogonadism, diabetes, thromboses, metabolic syndrome, various cancers (breast, hematological, and extragonadal germ cell tumors), and cardiovascular disease. They should receive appropriate counseling and referrals.\n[55]\n\nOther Genetic Disorders\n\nThe overall incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in infertile men is about 6%.\n[56]\nThe highest risk is found in nonobstructive azoospermic men.\n[57]\n[58]\nThe absence of 1 or both vas deferens and/or the seminal vesicles on transrectal ultrasound is highly suggestive of a genetic interaction associated with cystic fibrosis, which will be present about 80% of the time.\n[59]\nIt is recommended that both the patient and his partner be tested for the cystic fibrosis gene (CFTR). Other abnormalities include Robertsonian and reciprocal translocations as well as chromosomal inversions.\n\nAll men with primary testicular failure should be given karyotype and Y chromosome microdeletion testing. About 6% of men with NOA will have microdeletions of the Y chromosome involving the AZFa and/or AZFb subregions. Men with such microdeletions typically have extremely poor sperm retrieval rates and should be counseled to consider using donor sperm for ICSI or adoption.\n[60]\n\nFour percent will have a microdeletion of the AZFc subregion, which is not quite as severe a problem with infertility but will be inherited by male offspring. Up to 30% of nonobstructive azoospermic men will have Y chromosome microdeletions.\n[6]\nComplete deletions of the AZFa, AZFb, or AZFc subregions generally result in NOA. Histologically, about 46% of men with AZFc microdeletions will demonstrate Sertoli cell-only syndrome, and 38% of the men will have maturational arrest.\n[61]\nThere are also rare cases where atypical Y chromosome microdeletions will be found. Individualized counseling and treatment should be offered to such patients.\n\nMen with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism should also be considered for genetic testing. About a third will demonstrate a genetic lesion with variable inheritance. For example, 13 genes contributing to maturational arrest resulting in NOA have been identified.\n[62]\n\nDifferentiating Obstructive from Nonobstructive\nAzoospermia\n\nOA patients tend to have normal FSH and LH levels along with normal-sized testes. Testicular ultrasound may demonstrate an increased intratesticular resistive index or some dilated ducts in the testes, epididymis, or proximal vas.\n\nNOA patients may have normal FSH and LH levels but will often show elevated levels. The size of the testes may be normal, hypotrophic, or atrophic. If the differentiation is still unclear, a testis biopsy may be required.\n\nFurther Evaluation of Low Semen Volume Azoospermia\n\nAzoospermia patients with semen volumes consistently below 1.5 ml are likely to have retrograde ejaculation, an ejaculatory duct cyst, or congenital absence of the vas or seminal vesicle. Examination of the post-ejaculation urine sample can identify patients with retrograde ejaculation. The physical examination can determine if there is an absent vas deferens. Transrectal ultrasonography or cystoscopy can be used to identify an ejaculatory duct cyst. The seminal vesicles can be evaluated with transrectal ultrasonography.\n\nFurther Evaluation for Obstructive Azoospermia\n\nIn cases of OA, the hormonal profile and testicular volume measurements are generally normal.\n\nDilation of the epididymis, hydrocele presence, or vas deferens' absence suggest obstruction. Azoospermia due to vasal obstruction or epididymal obstruction has a normal biochemical profile in the seminal fluid. Testicular biopsy is indicated in azoospermic men with normal testicular examinations and hormonal profiles. These patients do not require a karyotype evaluation. However, an assessment for the CFTR gene mutation should be performed to rule out cystic fibrosis.\n\nFurther Evaluation of Nonobstructive Azoospermia\n\nAzoospermia is diagnosed with at least 2 separate semen samples for detailed analysis. In NOA, the abnormal hormonal profile suggests a significant spermatogenic abnormality, as evidenced by an elevated FSH level. In cases of a normal hormonal profile, a testicular biopsy can be used to evaluate spermatogenesis further, as it would be the definitive way to diagnose azoospermia from causes like maturational arrest and Sertoli cell-only syndrome. A karyotype analysis, genetic testing, and Y chromosome microdeletion test should be performed to assess genetic abnormalities. Endocrinological abnormalities are diagnosed and then managed accordingly.\n\nDiagnostic Testicular Biopsy\n\nThe design of the testicular tissue is heterogeneous, and spermatogenesis occurs in the foci; hence, a biopsy is infrequently utilized as a diagnostic tool.\n[63]\nAs a rule, testicular characteristics and diagnostic lab findings are good but imperfect indicators of NOA. Hence, testicular sperm extraction (TESE) can be performed in a specialized assisted reproduction center, which permits cryopreservation of sperm and avoids testicular biopsy. A normal testicular biopsy result is suggestive of obstruction, and vasography is required to identify the precise location of the blockage. A formal surgical repair can then be performed or sperm retrieval as appropriate. Depending on the severity of the defect, serum testosterone levels can be low, normal, or high. Only a single testis needs to be biopsied for a histological diagnosis. The larger of the 2 testes should be selected for the procedure.\n\nTesticular Etiologies\n\nDirect testicular pathology may be inferred from varicocele-induced testicular damage, undescended testes, testicular torsion, mumps orchitis, toxic effects of medications, radiation, hereditary variations from normal and idiopathic causes. Essential testicular failure in conjunction with azoospermia, commonly named NOA, is best managed by collecting testicular sperm, if possible, for ICSI. Higher serum FSH levels and smaller testicular volumes are suggestive of a more severe degree of spermatogenic disruption and poorer outcomes in men with NOA.\n[64]\n\nIn general, maturational arrest, Sertoli cell-only syndrome, and Y chromosome microdeletions of AZFa, AZFb, or AZFc subregions are permanent and untreatable forms of NOA. However, micro-TESE may allow sperm retrieval in about 50% of cases.\n\nOther causes of azoospermia include XYY syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, Noonan syndrome, 5 alpha-reductase deficiency, androgen insensitivity syndrome, and vanishing testis syndrome. There is sufficient evidence to confirm that varicoceles have a deleterious impact on the semen and testes, while varicocelectomy has been shown to improve sperm parameters and testicular function.\n[65]\n[66]\n[67]\nHowever, only a small percentage of men with azoospermia due to testicular failure will benefit from surgical treatment of their clinical varicocele.\n[68]\n\nUndescended Testes\n\nUndescended testicles are the most common genital condition in boys and young males. They are noted in 2.7% of newborns and up to 0.8% of 1-year-olds.\n[69]\nIt is important to distinguish cryptorchid from retractile testicles, a circumstance involving hyperactive cremasteric muscles that cause the testes to intermittently dwell within the inguinal canal or high in the scrotum. Most men with a history of unilateral undescended testicles are capable of paternity. Testicular volume and age at orchiopexy are autonomous, independent predictors of fertility potential and potential sperm retrieval in men with a history of cryptorchidism.\n[70]\n[71]\n\nTesticular Torsion\n\nTesticular torsion occurs in about 1 in 4,000 males before the age of 25 years.\n[72]\nThis disorder requires prompt surgical exploration with corrective detorsion and bilateral orchidopexy, as the dangers of nonoperative management are well documented.\n[73]\nTesticular conservation is usually accomplished if the surgical procedure is performed within 6 hours. Usually, non-absorbable sutures are used for orchidopexy (at least 3 points of fixation on each side), and it is customary to perform a prophylactic orchidopexy on the contralateral testis at the time of the surgery.",
    "administration": "Azoospermia Management\n\nIn this era of advanced assisted reproductive techniques, infertile couples have several options to complete their family biologically.\n\nObstructive Azoospermia\n\nThe main aim of managing OA is to correct the site of obstruction by using reconstructive surgical techniques, eg, vasoepididymostomy and vasovasostomy. Assisted reproductive techniques are useful in patients suffering from congenital absence of vas deferens, as surgical reconstruction in these patients is not feasible. In cases of ejaculatory ductal obstruction, surgical correction with transurethral resection is performed to achieve the patency of the ejaculatory ducts. Intraoperative vasography gives better results than vasoepididyostomy. Transurethral resection improves semen parameters in about 50% to 70% of cases.\n\nSperm retrieval for assisted reproduction is an excellent option for managing OA, as successful sperm recovery is close to 100%. ICSI has increased pregnancy rates as the sperm obtained are motile, and samples can also be cryopreserved.\n[74]\n[75]\nIn patients suffering from OA, if surgical repair is not possible or the female factor is a major contributor to infertility in couples, sperm retrieval for assisted reproduction is an excellent option for managing the infertile state. Surgical bypass or repair of sperm obstructions is generally possible in less than 50% of men with OA.\n[76]\n\nThe area of obstruction most commonly found is in the epididymis. Current success rates for vasoepididymostomies are 85% patency rates with a 50% spontaneous pregnancy rate. Collecting and cryopreserving sperm at the time of surgery is recommended if the outcome is unsuccessful. Inguinal approaches for microscopic vasovasostomy have been described, and laparoscopic and robotic techniques for vas isolation before a microsurgical anastomosis.\n[77]\n\nIn OA, microsurgical epididymal sperm aspiration (MESA) is optimally used for sperm retrieval when possible. This is almost always successful for extra-testicular obstructions. If the blockage is intratesticular, then TESE or TESA will be required. Post-vasectomy obstructions can be treated with microscopic vasectomy reversals, which currently achieve a reported postoperative patency rate of 90% to 97%.\n[38]\nThese surgeries may also be done robotically with similar success rates.\n[78]\n\nObstruction from scarring, inflammation, or ejaculatory duct cysts is typically treated with transurethral resection of the duct. Reported pregnancy rates following such procedures are 12.5% to 31%, while side effects include failure, incontinence, reflux into the seminal vesicles and ejaculatory ducts, as well as epididymitis. Intraoperative transrectal ultrasound and using methylene blue to verify patency can help reduce complications and increase the procedure's safety.\n[79]\nThe procedure can also be done with a transurethral laser incision of the ejaculatory duct along with seminal vesiculoscopy. Still, it is unclear if this offers any significant advantages over the standard procedure.\n[80]\n\nPercutaneous procedures, including TESE, percutaneous epididymal aspiration of sperm, and percutaneous testicular biopsy, can be performed to obtain sperm in couples desiring fertility. However, the highest rates of successful sperm retrieval are reported with microdissection testicular sperm extraction techniques.\n\nNonobstructive Azoospermia\n\nAdvanced assisted reproductive techniques are required for most patients with NOA. Both ICSI and microscopic testicular sperm extraction (micro-TESE) are potentially beneficial to these patients. In testicular sperm aspiration (TESA), a needle is inserted into the testicular parenchyma percutaneously. The failure rate of sperm retrieval in NOA is high and varies with the underlying etiology. Overall success in sperm retrieval in these patients is reportedly as high as 75% but averages about 50%. There is also a significant risk of vascular injury. In addition, it has been observed that the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities and DNA damage in the sperm is relatively high in patients with NOA, and potentially inheritable infertility-related genes may be passed on to male offspring. Repeat micro-TESE procedures can be performed successfully, if necessary, to retrieve sperm.\n[81]\n\nMen who become azoospermic as a result of testosterone supplementation therapy have an excellent chance of recovery of spermatogenesis just by stopping the hormonal treatment and waiting.\n[29]\nMost men will recover 85% of their pretreatment sperm counts after 1 year and almost all in 2 years.\n[82]\n[83]\n\nTo stimulate spermatogenesis in cases of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism or pre-testicular azoospermia (secondary hypogonadism, testosterone therapy), gonadotropin analogs or FSH and HCG are used. The preferred therapy includes HCG (3,000 IU to 10,000 IU injections 2 to 3 times per week) plus either anastrozole, clomiphene, FSH, or tamoxifen.\n[29]\n\nThis therapy has demonstrated success in achieving at least some sperm in the ejaculate of 75% to 77% of men with NOA due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, but treatment may require as long as 6 months.\n[84]\nPulsed GnRH is an option but is usually more expensive and does not offer any substantial benefit over standard treatment. Testosterone therapy is specifically not recommended.\n\nWhile up to about 11% of azoospermic men who received hormone therapy (usually clomiphene) have shown improvement with the presence of sperm in the ejaculate, there is no standardization of this therapy and no good-quality randomized trials. Therefore, many experts and the European Association of Urology (EAU) do not recommend the general use of hormone therapy in men with NOA and primary hypogonadism.\n[38]\nThe main treatment for these men is microscopic testicular sperm extraction when feasible and ICSI. Overall success with these techniques resulting in a pregnancy is no more than 25%, and they are costly.\n\nThe role of estrogen receptor modulators, gonadotropins, and aromatase inhibitors in men with primary hypogonadism and NOA is much more controversial. These are frequently used to improve sperm parameters in infertile oligozoospermic men, and some evidence supports their use.\n[85]\n[86]\n[87]\nHowever, their effectiveness in improving sperm retrieval rates through TESE or TESA is somewhat uncertain and has not been definitively proven.\n[38]\nThe optimal protocol and dosing schedule have not yet been determined, although a progressive protocol starting with clomiphene and escalating to HCG has been proposed.\n[87]\nThere are also potential side effects from the therapy. However, despite these limitations, and since no other treatment is available, the use of hormone stimulation therapy remains a common clinical practice.\n[88]\n\nTreatment of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is relatively effective. One regimen for azoospermic men due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is the pulsatile administration of 5 mcg to 20 mcg of GnRH every 2 hours using a portable infusion pump. The return of sperm in the semen was generally noted after 6 months of therapy, and 77% of initially azoospermic men were found to have spermatogenesis after 12 to 24 months of treatment.\n[89]\n\nFSH stimulation before GnRH therapy seems to improve the outcomes. GnRH is only effective in men with normal pituitary activity. Gonadotropin treatment with HCG (with or without FSH) is preferred in patients with decreased or absent pituitary function. The suggested dosage is 1000 IU to 3000 IU 2 to 3 times weekly. This typically leads to sperm production after 3 to 6 months. If unsuccessful, FSH is added at a 75 IU to 150 IU dose twice a week.\n[90]\nThe overall success rate of spermatogenesis from medical therapy of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is about 75%. If medical treatment is unsuccessful, assisted reproductive techniques are recommended.\n[88]\n[91]\n\nMen with NOA tend to have a higher incidence of other health-related disorders, including pituitary prolactinomas, various neoplasms (including Sertoli cell, Leydig cell, and germ-cell tumors) and have 3 times the overall risk of developing a future malignancy compared to infertile men without azoospermia.\n[20]\nAbout 30% of men with NOA also have testosterone deficiency, usually due to Leydig cell dysfunction.\n[92]\n[93]\n\nThe only absolute contraindications for an attempt at sperm retrieval in male nonobstructive azoospermic patients are Y chromosomal microdeletions of the AZFa or AZFb subregions and post bilateral orchiectomy as the sperm retrieval rates will be zero. Even in cases of Sertoli cell-only syndrome, there is a reported sperm retrieval success rate with micro-TESE of at least 24%, with a mean average rate of about 50%.\n[41]\n[94]\nNo degree of testicular atrophy or FSH elevation can determine the success or failure of a sperm retrieval procedure.\n\nGood predictive indicators of successful sperm retrieval with micro-TESE in nonobstructive azoospermic men include focal type Sertoli cell-only syndrome, late-stage maturation arrest (compared to early maturation arrest), hypospermatogenesis (as opposed to maturation arrest or Sertoli cell-only syndrome), and viable sperm visible in the seminiferous tubules on testis biopsy. With micro-TESE, the successful sperm retrieval rate is about 50%, while ICSI also has approximately a 50% success rate, giving an overall pregnancy rate of only 25%. Given the associated costs and potential genetic consequences, couples should seriously consider artificial insemination or ICSI using donor sperm or adoption before starting advanced reproduction treatments.",
    "adverse_effects": "Complications of azoospermia and/or associated surgical treatment include the following:\n\nHematoma formation due to surgery\nInfection\nParenchymal fibrosis of testis\nTesticular atrophy\n\nAdditionally, azoospermia can lead to significant emotional distress, impacting the mental health of affected individuals and straining relationships. The pursuit of fertility treatments, while offering hope for conception, may also entail financial burdens and emotional stress. The psychological toll of grappling with infertility and potential societal stigmas surrounding male reproductive health further compounds the challenges and complications associated with azoospermia."
