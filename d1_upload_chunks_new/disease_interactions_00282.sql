Ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and torsades de pointes have occurred in some patients.  Patients with underlying cardiac dysfunction, bradycardia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or high antiarrhythmic serum concentrations are at increased risk for drug-induced arrhythmias.  Therapy with antiarrhythmics should be used with extreme caution in patients with or predisposed to arrhythmias.  Evidence of improved survival is lacking for use of antiarrhythmic therapy in asymptomatic, non-life-threatening arrhythmias.  Therapy with antiarrhythmic agents should be reserved for patients with life-threatening arrhythmias.', '3', '', 'DDInter', 0);

A similar pattern of low neutrophil and platelet counts was seen with tocilizumab in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (PJIA) or systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA); neutrophils and platelets should be monitored at the second dose and thereafter every 4 to 8 weeks for PJIA and every 2 to 4 weeks for SJIA.
