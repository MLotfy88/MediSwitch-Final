The clinical significance and underlying etiology of the bradycardia observed with thalidomide treatment have not been established. However, the potential for additive bradycardic effects should be considered when used with other drugs that slow cardiac conduction such as beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digitalis, flecainide, moricizine, and propafenone. Non-cardiac drugs that may also cause bradycardia include atazanavir, lacosamide, lithium, mefloquine, succinylcholine, H2-receptor antagonists, tricyclic antidepressants, and anticholinesterase or cholinergic agents. Because bradycardia is a risk factor for torsade de pointes arrhythmia, concerns also exist when thalidomide is used with drugs that prolong the QT interval or cause torsade de pointes.', 'DDInter', 'Caution is advised when thalidomide is used with drugs that can slow the heart rate or induce torsade de pointes arrhythmia.
