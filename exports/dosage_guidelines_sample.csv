The usual dose of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide 75 mg/50 mg, is one tablet daily, with appropriate monitoring of serum potassium (see WARNINGS ). There is no experience with the use of more than one 75 mg/50 mg tablet, daily or more than two 37.5 mg/25 mg tablets, daily. Clinical experience with the administration of two 37.5 mg/25 mg tablets, daily in divided doses (rather than as a single dose) suggests an increased risk of electrolyte imbalance and renal dysfunction. Patients receiving 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide who become hypokalemic may be transferred to the 75 mg/50 mg product, directly. Patients receiving 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide who become hypokalemic may be transferred to the 37.5 mg/25 mg product, directly. In patients requiring hydrochlorothiazide therapy and in whom hypokalemia cannot be risked, therapy may be initiated with 37.5 mg/25 mg of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide. If an optimal blood pressure response is not obtained with 37.5 mg/25 mg of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide, the dose should be increased to two 37.5 mg/25 mg tablets daily as a single dose, or one 75 mg/50 mg tablet daily. Clinical studies have shown that patients taking less bioavailable formulations of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide in daily doses of 25 mg to 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide and 50 mg to 100 mg of triamterene may be safely changed to one triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide 37.5 mg/25 mg tablet daily.",,,,,,

Intramuscular injection of the sodium salts of barbiturates should be made deeply into a large muscle and a volume of 5 mL should not be exceeded at any one site because of possible tissue irritation. Injection into or near peripheral nerves may result in permanent neurological deficit. After intramuscular injection of a hypnotic dose, the patient's vital signs should be monitored. Intravenous Administration Intravenous injection is restricted to conditions in which other routes are not feasible, either because the patient is unconscious (as in cerebral hemorrhage, eclampsia or status epilepticus), or because the patient resists (as in delirium) or because prompt action is imperative. Slow IV injection is essential, and patients should be carefully observed during administration. The rate of intravenous injection for adults should not exceed 60 mg/min for phenobarbital sodium. When given intravenously, do not use small veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. Preference should be given to a larger vein to minimize the risk of irritation with the possibility of resultant thrombosis. Inadvertent injection into or adjacent to an artery has resulted in gangrene requiring amputation of an extremity or a portion thereof. Careful technique, including aspiration, is necessary to avoid inadvertent intraarterial injection. Recommended treatment includes the application of moist heat and the injection of 0.5% procaine solution into the affected area. Intraarterial injection of any barbiturate must be avoided. The accidental intraarterial injection of a small amount of the solution may cause spasm and severe pain along the course of the artery. The injection should be terminated if the patient complains of pain or if other indications of accidental intraarterial injection occur, such as a white hand with cyanosed skin or patches of discolored skin and delayed onset of hypnosis. The consequences of intraarterial injection of phenobarbital can vary from transient pain to gangrene. The following procedures have been suggested: 1) release of the tourniquet or restrictive garments to permit dilution of injected drug, 2) relief of arterial spasm by injecting 10 mL of a 1% procaine solution into the artery and, if considered necessary, brachial plexus block, 3) prevention of thrombosis by early anticoagulant therapy and 4) supportive treatment. In children and infants, phenobarbital at loading doses of 15 to 20 mg/kg produces blood levels of about 20 μg/mL shortly after administration. When administered intravenously, phenobarbital sodium may require 15 minutes or more to attain peak concentrations in the brain. If phenobarbital sodium is injected continuously until the convulsions stop, the brain concentration will continue to rise and can eventually exceed that required to control the seizures. Because a barbiturate-induced depression may occur along with a postictal depression once the seizures are controlled, it is important, therefore, to use the minimal amount required and to wait for the anticonvulsant effect to develop before administering a second dose.",,,,,,Oral

When treating patients with 300 mg/day, the physician should observe sufficient increased clinical benefit to offset potential increased risk. In patients with mildly impaired renal function, the maximum recommended total daily dose of ketoprofen immediate-release capsules or ketoprofen extended-release capsules is 150 mg. In patients with a more severe renal impairment (GFR less than 25 mL/min/1.73 m2 or end-stage renal impairment), the maximum total daily dose of ketoprofen immediate-release capsules or ketoprofen extended-release capsules should not exceed 100 mg. Therefore, it is recommended that the initial dosage of ketoprofen immediate-release capsules or ketoprofen extended-release capsules should be reduced for patients over 75 years of age (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use).

Cesarean Section Patients The first dose of 1 gram is administered intravenously as soon as the umbilical cord is clamped. The second and third doses should be given as 1 gram intravenously or intramuscularly at 6 and 12 hours after the first dose. Neonates, Infants, and Children The following dosage schedule is recommended: Neonates (birth to 1 month): 0-1 week of age 50 mg/kg per dose every 12 hours IV 1-4 weeks of age 50 mg/kg per dose every 8 hours IV It is not necessary to differentiate between premature and normal-gestational age infants. Infants and Children (1 month to 12 years): For body weights less than 50 kg, the recommended daily dose is 50 to 180 mg/kg IM or IV body weight divided into four to six equal doses. For body weights 50 kg or more, the usual adult dosage should be used; the maximum daily dosage should not exceed 12 grams. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. NOTE: As with antibiotic therapy in general, administration of Cefotaxime for injection should be continued for a minimum of 48 to 72 hours after the patient defervesces or after evidence of bacterial eradication has been obtained; a minimum of 10 days of treatment is recommended for infections caused by Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci in order to guard against the risk of rheumatic fever or glomerulonephritis; frequent bacteriologic and clinical appraisal is necessary during therapy of chronic urinary tract infection and may be required for several months after therapy has been completed; persistent infections may require treatment of several weeks and doses smaller than those indicated above should not be used. Preparation of Cefotaxime for injection Sterile Cefotaxime for injection for IM or IV administration should be reconstituted as follows: Strength Diluent(mL) Withdrawable Volume (mL) Approximate Concentration(mg/mL) 500 mg vial (IM)1 g vial (IM)2 g vial (IM)500 mg vial (IV)1 g vial (IV)2 g vial (IV) 235101010 2.23.4610.210.411 2303003305095180 Shake to dissolve; inspect for particulate matter and discoloration prior to use. Solutions of Cefotaxime for injection range from very pale yellow to light amber, depending on concentration, diluent used, and length and condition of storage. For intramuscular use: Reconstitute VIALS with Sterile Water for Injection or Bacteriostatic Water for Injection as described above. For intravenous use: Reconstitute VIALS with at least 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection. NOTE: Solutions of Cefotaxime for injection must not be admixed with aminoglycoside solutions. If Cefotaxime for injection and aminoglycosides are to be administered to the same patient, they must be administered separately and not as mixed injection.A SOLUTION OF 1 G CEFOTAXIME FOR INJECTION IN 14 ML OF STERILE WATER FOR INJECTION IS ISOTONIC. IM Administration: As with all IM preparations, Cefotaxime for injection should be injected well within the body of a relatively large muscle such as the upper outer quadrant of the buttock (i.e., gluteus maximus); aspiration is necessary to avoid inadvertent injection into a blood vessel.

Adult Dosage : Divided daily dosage : Patients who have received no previous treatment may be started on one 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule, USP three times daily and the dosage then adjusted to suit individual requirements. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dosage will be one capsule three to four times a day. Once-a-day dosage : In adults, if seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules, USP daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg of extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. Studies comparing divided doses of 300 mg with a single daily dose of this quantity indicated absorption, peak plasma levels, biologic half-life, difference between peak and minimum values, and urinary recovery were equivalent. A major problem in motivating noncompliant patients may also be lessened when the patient can take this drug once a day. Initially, one gram of phenytoin capsules is divided into three doses (400 mg, 300 mg, 300 mg) and administered at two-hour intervals. Normal maintenance dosage is then instituted 24 hours after the loading dose, with frequent serum level determinations. Pediatric Dosage : Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years old and adolescents may require the minimum adult dose (300 mg/day).",,,,,,Oral

Begin dosing at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Although LYRICA was also studied at 600 mg/day, there is no evidence that this dose confers additional significant benefit and this dose was less well tolerated. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions, treatment with doses above 300 mg/day is not recommended [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 2.2 Postherpetic neuralgia The recommended dose of LYRICA is 75 to 150 mg two times a day, or 50 to 100 mg three times a day (150 to 300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL/min. Begin dosing at 75 mg two times a day, or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day, and who are able to tolerate LYRICA, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day, or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day). In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, reserve dosing above 300 mg/day for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 300 mg daily [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 2.3 Adjunctive therapy for adult patients with partial onset seizures LYRICA at doses of 150 to 600 mg/day has been shown to be effective as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures in adults. Administer the total daily dose in two or three divided doses. In general, it is recommended that patients be started on a total daily dose no greater than 150 mg/day (75 mg two times a day, or 50 mg three times a day). Based on individual patient response and tolerability, the dose may be increased to a maximum dose of 600 mg/day. 2.4 Management of Fibromyalgia The recommended dose of LYRICA for fibromyalgia is 300 to 450 mg/day.

This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment. You may give other people a serious infection, or get a serious infection from them. Supplies needed to give your injection an APIDRA 10 mL vial a U-100 insulin syringe and needle 2 alcohol swabs 1 sharps container for throwing away used needles and syringes. Always use a new syringe or needle for each injection to help prevent infections and prevent blocked needles. You may give other people a serious infection or get a serious infection from them. Put the needle through the rubber top of the vial and push the plunger to inject the air into the vial. Step 5: Before you take the needle out of the vial, check the syringe for air bubbles. You are now ready to inject. Giving your APIDRA injection with a syringe Inject your insulin exactly as your healthcare provider has shown you. APIDRA starts acting fast, so give your injection within 15 minutes before or right after you eat a meal. Step 7: Choose your injection site: APIDRA is injected under the skin (subcutaneously) of your upper arms, thighs, or stomach area (abdomen). Change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in the skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the injection sites. Do not inject where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. Do not inject where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard, or into scars or damaged skin. Wipe the skin with an alcohol swab to clean the injection site. Let the injection site dry before you inject. Slowly push in the plunger of the syringe all the way, making sure you have injected all the insulin. Gently press the injection site for several seconds. APIDRA should be given into an area of your body recommended in the instructions that come with your insulin pump. Change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each insertion to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the injection sites. Do not inject into the exact same spot for each injection. Do not inject where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. Do not inject where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard, or into scars or damaged skin. You should be trained on how to give insulin by injection and have an alternative insulin delivery system in case of pump failure. How should I store APIDRA 10 mL vial?

INTRAOPERATIVE MEDICATION Glycopyrrolate injection may be used during surgery to counteract drug-induced or vagal reflexes and their associated arrhythmias (e.g., bradycardia). It should be administered intravenously as single doses of 0.1 mg and repeated, as needed, at intervals of 2 to 3 minutes. REVERSAL OF NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKADE The recommended dose of glycopyrrolate injection is 0.2 mg for each 1 mg of neostigmine or 5 mg of pyridostigmine.

If a dose is missed it should be taken as soon as possible, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Patients should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made. The probability of thrombocytopenia increases significantly at total trough valproate plasma concentrations above 110 mcg/mL in females and 135 mcg/mL in males.

No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made. If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in divided doses. However, since valproate may interact with these or other concurrently administered AEDs as well as other drugs, periodic plasma concentration determinations of concomitant AEDs are recommended during the early course of therapy [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Simple and Complex Absence Seizures The recommended initial dose is 15 mg/kg/day, increasing at one week intervals by 5 to 10 mg/kg/day until seizures are controlled or side effects preclude further increases. The maximum recommended dosage is 60 mg/kg/day. If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in divided doses. A good correlation has not been established between daily dose, serum concentrations, and therapeutic effect.

In order to minimize patient exposure to the plasticizer DEHP [di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate], which may be leached from PVC infusion bags or sets, diluted paclitaxel solutions should be stored in bottles (glass, polypropylene) or plastic bags (polypropylene, polyolefin) and administered through polyethylene-lined administration sets. Such premedication may consist of dexamethasone 20 mg PO administered approximately 12 and 6 hours before paclitaxel, diphenhydramine (or its equivalent) 50 mg I.V. 30 to 60 minutes prior to paclitaxel, and cimetidine (300 mg) or ranitidine (50 mg) I.V. For patients with carcinoma of the ovary the following regimen is recommended: (see CLINICAL STUDIES: Ovarian Carcinoma): 1) For previously untreated patients with carcinoma of the ovary, one of the following recommended regimens may be given every 3 weeks. Paclitaxel administered intravenously over 3 hours at a dose of 175 mg/m2 followed by cisplatin at a dose of 75 mg/m2; or b. Paclitaxel administered intravenously over 24 hours at a dose of 135 mg/m2 followed by cisplatin at a dose of 75 mg/m2. The recommended regimen is paclitaxel 135 mg/m2 or 175 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 3 hours every 3 weeks. For patients with carcinoma of the breast, the following is recommended (see CLINICAL STUDIES: Breast Carcinoma section): 1) For the adjuvant treatment of node-positive breast cancer, the recommended regimen is paclitaxel, at a dose of 175 mg/m2 intravenously over 3 hours every 3 weeks for 4 courses administered sequentially to doxorubicin-containing combination chemotherapy. 2) After failure of initial chemotherapy for metastatic disease or relapse within 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy, paclitaxel at a dose of 175 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 3 hours every 3 weeks has been shown to be effective. For patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma, the recommended regimen, given every 3 weeks, is paclitaxel administered intravenously over 24 hours at a dose of 135 mg/m2 followed by cisplatin, 75 mg/m2. For patients with AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma, paclitaxel administered at a dose of 135 mg/m2 given intravenously over 3 hours every 3 weeks or at a dose of 100 mg/m2 given intravenously over 3 hours every 2 weeks is recommended (dose intensity 45 to 50 mg/m2/week). In the 2 clinical trials evaluating these schedules (see CLINICAL STUDIES: AIDS-Related Kaposi’s Sarcoma), the former schedule (135 mg/m2 every 3 weeks) was more toxic than the latter. In addition, all patients with low performance status were treated with the latter schedule (100 mg/m2 every 2 weeks). Based upon the immunosuppression in patients with advanced HIV disease, the following modifications are recommended in these patients: 1) Reduce the dose of dexamethasone as 1 of the 3 premedication drugs to 10 mg PO (instead of 20 mg PO); 2) Initiate or repeat treatment with paclitaxel only if the neutrophil count is at least 1,000 cells/mm3; 3) Reduce the dose of subsequent courses of paclitaxel by 20% for patients who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophil <500 cells/mm3 for a week or longer); and 4) Initiate concomitant hematopoietic growth factor (G-CSF) as clinically indicated. Paclitaxel should not be given to patients with AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma if the baseline or subsequent neutrophil count is less than 1,000 cells/mm3. Patients who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophil <500 cells/mm3 for a week or longer) or severe peripheral neuropathy during Paclitaxel Injection, USP therapy should have dosage reduced by 20% for subsequent courses of paclitaxel.",,DailyMed,False,,,Oral

The 20% solution may be diluted to a lesser concentration with either Sodium Chloride Injection, Sodium Chloride for Inhalation, Sterile Water for Injection, or Sterile Water for Inhalation. Acetylcysteine does not contain an antimicrobial agent, and care must be taken to minimize contamination of the sterile solution. Nebulization — Face Mask, Mouthpiece, Tracheostomy: When nebulized into a face mask, mouthpiece, or tracheostomy, 1 to 10 mL of the 20% solution or 2 to 20 mL of the 10% solution may be given every 2 to 6 hours; the recommended dose for most patients is 3 to 5 mL of the 20% solution or 6 to 10 mL of the 10% solution three to four times a day. Nebulization — Tent, Croupette: In special circumstances it may be necessary to nebulize into a tent or Croupette, and this method of use must be individualized to take into account the available equipment and the patient’s particular needs. This form of administration requires very large volumes of the solution, occasionally as much as 300 mL during a single treatment period. If a tent or Croupette must be used, the recommended dose is the volume of acetylcysteine (using 10 or 20%) that will maintain a very heavy mist in the tent or Croupette for the desired period. Direct Instillation: When used by direct instillation, 1 to 2 mL of a 10% to 20% solution may be given as often as every hour. When used for the routine nursing care of patients with tracheostomy, 1 to 2 mL of a 10% to 20% solution may be given every 1 to 4 hours by instillation into the tracheostomy. Two to 5 mL of the 20% solution may then be instilled by means of a syringe connected to the catheter. Acetylcysteine may also be given through a percutaneous intratracheal catheter. One to 2 mL of the 20% or 2 to 4 mL of the 10% solution every 1 to 4 hours may then be given by a syringe attached to the catheter. Diagnostic Bronchograms: For diagnostic bronchial studies, 2 or 3 administrations of 1 to 2 mL of the 20% solution or 2 to 4 mL of the 10% solution should be given by nebulization or by instillation intratracheally, prior to the procedure. Administration of Aerosol Materials: Acetylcysteine solution may be administered using conventional nebulizers made of plastic or glass.

Do not use diluents containing calcium, such as Ringer's solution or Hartmann's solution, to reconstitute ceftriaxone for injection vials or to further dilute a reconstituted vial for IV administration because a precipitate can form. Precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium can also occur when ceftriaxone for injection is mixed with calcium-containing solutions in the same IV administration line. Ceftriaxone for injection must not be administered simultaneously with calcium-containing IV solutions, including continuous calcium-containing infusions such as parenteral nutrition via a Y-site. However, in patients other than neonates, ceftriaxone for injection and calcium-containing solutions may be administered sequentially of one another if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid (see WARNINGS). NEONATES: Hyperbilirubinemic neonates, especially prematures, should not be treated with ceftriaxone for injection (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Ceftriaxone for injection is contraindicated in neonates if they require (or are expected to require) treatment with calcium-containing IV solutions, including continuous calcium-containing infusions such as parenteral nutrition because of the risk of precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). PEDIATRIC PATIENTS: For the treatment of skin and skin structure infections, the recommended total daily dose is 50 to 75 mg/kg given once a day (or in equally divided doses twice a day).

The administration of SURVANTA is facilitated if one person administers the dose while another person positions and monitors the infant. Before administering SURVANTA, assure proper placement and patency of the endotracheal tube. At the discretion of the clinician, the endotracheal tube may be suctioned before administering SURVANTA. Administer SURVANTA intratracheally by instillation through a 5 French end-hole catheter. Recommended Dosage Each dose of SURVANTA is 100 mg of phospholipids/kg birth weight (4 mL/kg). In the prevention strategy, in premature infants with evidence of surfactant deficiency, give the first dose of SURVANTA as soon as possible, preferably within 15 minutes of birth. To treat infants with RDS confirmed by radiographic and clinical findings, give the first dose of SURVANTA as soon as possible, preferably by 8 hours of age. Four doses of SURVANTA can be administered in the first 48 hours of life. Doses should be given no more frequently than every 6 hours. Radiographic confirmation of RDS should be obtained before administering additional doses to those who received a prevention dose. If a prevention dose is to be given, preparation of SURVANTA should begin before the infant’s birth. Slowly withdraw the entire contents of the vial into a plastic syringe through a large-gauge needle (e.g., at least 20 gauge). Discard excess SURVANTA through the catheter so that only the total dose to be given remains in the syringe. When administering SURVANTA using a 5 French end-hole catheter, administer in four quarter-dose aliquots. Each quarter-dose is administered with the infant in a different position: Head and body inclined 5-10° down, head turned to the right Head and body inclined 5-10° down, head turned to the left Head and body inclined 5-10° up, head turned to the right Head and body inclined 5-10° up, head turned to the left 4.

( 2.7 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions Pregabalin capsules are given orally with or without food. 2.2 Neuropathic Pain Associated with Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy in Adults The maximum recommended dose of pregabalin capsule is 100 mg three times a day (300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL/min. Begin dosing at 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Although pregabalin was also studied at 600 mg/day, there is no evidence that this dose confers additional significant benefit and this dose was less well tolerated. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions, treatment with doses above 300 mg/day is not recommended [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 2.3 Postherpetic Neuralgia in Adults The recommended dose of pregabalin is 75 mg to 150 mg two times a day, or 50 mg to 100 mg three times a day (150 mg/day to 300 mg/day) in patients with creatinine clearance of at least 60 mL/min. Begin dosing at 75 mg two times a day, or 50 mg three times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with 300 mg/day, and who are able to tolerate pregabalin, may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day, or 200 mg three times a day (600 mg/day). In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, reserve dosing above 300 mg/day for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 300 mg daily [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ].

Begin dosing at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg/day may be further increased to 225 mg two times a day (450 mg/day). Although pregabalin was also studied at 600 mg/day, there is no evidence that this dose confers additional benefit and this dose was less well tolerated. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions, treatment with doses above 450 mg/day is not recommended [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 2.6 Neuropathic Pain Associated with Spinal Cord Injury in Adults The recommended dose range of pregabalin capsules for the treatment of neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury is 150 mg/day to 600 mg/day. The recommended starting dose is 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day). The dose may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment with 150 mg two times a day and who tolerate pregabalin may be treated with up to 300 mg two times a day [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ]. CLcr in mL/min may be estimated from serum creatinine (mg/dL) determination using the Cockcroft and Gault equation: Next, refer to the Dosage and Administration section to determine the recommended total daily dose based on indication, for a patient with normal renal function (CLcr greater than or equal to 60 mL/min). (For example: A patient initiating pregabalin therapy for postherpetic neuralgia with normal renal function (CLcr greater than or equal to 60 mL/min), receives a total daily dose of 150 mg/day pregabalin. Therefore, a renal impaired patient with a CLcr of 50 mL/min would receive a total daily dose of 75 mg/day pregabalin administered in two or three divided doses.) For patients undergoing hemodialysis, adjust the pregabalin daily dose based on renal function. In addition to the daily dose adjustment, administer a supplemental dose immediately following every 4-hour hemodialysis treatment (see ). Pregabalin Dosage Adjustment Based on Renal Function Creatinine Clearance (CLcr) (mL/min) Total Pregabalin Daily Dose (mg/day) Total daily dose (mg/day) should be divided as indicated by dose regimen to provide mg/dose. Dose Regimen TID= Three divided doses; BID = Two divided doses; QD = Single daily dose. Patients on the 25 mg QD regimen: take one supplemental dose of 25 mg or 50 mg Patients on the 25 mg to 50 mg QD regimen: take one supplemental dose of 50 mg or 75 mg Patients on the 50 mg to 75 mg QD regimen: take one supplemental dose of 75 mg or 100 mg Patients on the 75 mg QD regimen: take one supplemental dose of 100 mg or 150 mg Cockcroft and Gault equation.",,,,,,

Do not give the entire contents of the vial to a single patient. Do not administer ASCOR as an undiluted intravenous sensitive. Given that pressure may develop within the vial during storage, excercise caution when withdrawing contents from the vial. Add one daily dose of ASCOR directly to an appropriate volume of a suitable infusion solution (e.g., 5% Dextrose Injection, Sterile Water for Injection) and add appropriate solutes, as necessary, to make final solution isotonic. Sterile Water for Injection is highly hypotonic; adjust solute content, as necessary, to make thet final infusion solution isotonic prior to injection. The concentration of ascorbic acid in the final, admixture solution for infusion is to be the range of 1 to 25 mg of ascorbic acid per mL. For example, for the largest recommended dose: Add 200 mg of ascorbic acid (equivalent to 0.4 mL of ASCOR) to 7.5 mL of Sterile Water for Injection to produce an infusion solution having an approximate osmolarity of 290 mOsmol/L. Immediately administer the admixture for infusion as a slow intravenous infusion [ see Recommended Dosage, (2.2)] ASCOR vials contain 25, 000 mg of ascorbic acid and the largest recommended single dose is 200 mg.

In small cell lung cancer, the Etoposide Injection USP dose in combination with other approved chemotherapeutic drugs ranges from 35 mg/m2/day for 4 days to 50 mg/m2/day for 5 days. The dosage should be modified to take into account the myelosuppressive effects of other drugs in the combination or the effects of prior X-ray therapy or chemotherapy which may have compromised bone marrow reserve. Skin reactions associated with accidental exposure to Etoposide Injection USP may occur. Preparation for Intravenous Administration Etoposide Injection USP must be diluted prior to use with either 5% Dextrose Injection, or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, to give a final concentration of 0.2 to 0.4 mg/mL. If solutions are prepared at concentrations above 0.4 mg/mL, precipitation may occur.

Dosing and Administration for Adult Patients Patient Population Recommended Dosage Strength and Frequency Adult RA, AS, and PsA 50 mg weekly Adult PsO Starting Dose: 50 mg twice weekly for 3 months Maintenance Dose: 50 mg once weekly See the Enbrel (etanercept) “Instructions for Use” insert for detailed information on injection site selection and dose administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]. Based on a study of 50 mg Enbrel twice weekly in patients with RA that suggested higher incidence of adverse reactions but similar American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response rates, doses higher than 50 mg per week are not recommended. Adult Plaque Psoriasis Patients In addition to the 50 mg twice weekly recommended starting dose, starting doses of 25 mg or 50 mg per week were shown to be efficacious. 2.2 Pediatric Patients Enbrel is administered by subcutaneous injection. Dosing and Administration for Pediatric Patients (PsO or JIA ) Pediatric Patients Weight Recommended Dose 63 kg (138 pounds) or more 50 mg weekly Less than 63 kg (138 pounds) 0.8 mg/kg weekly To achieve pediatric doses other than 25 mg or 50 mg, use reconstituted Enbrel lyophilized powder.

Escitalopram oral solution should generally be administered once daily, morning or evening with or without food ( 2.1 , 2.2 ). Indication Recommended Dose MDD ( 2.1 ) Adolescents ( 2.1 ) Initial: 10 mg once daily Recommended: 10 mg once daily Maximum: 20 mg once daily Adults ( 2.1 ) Initial: 10 mg once daily Recommended: 10 mg once daily Maximum: 20 mg once daily GAD ( 2.2 ) Adults ( 2.2 ) Initial: 10 mg once daily Recommended: 10 mg once daily No additional benefits seen at 20 mg/day dose (2.1). 10 mg/day is the recommended dose for most elderly patients and patients with hepatic impairment ( 2.3 ). 2.1 Major Depressive Disorder Initial Treatment Adolescents The recommended dose of escitalopram oral solution is 10 mg once daily. A flexible-dose trial of escitalopram oral solution (10 to 20 mg/day) demonstrated the effectiveness of escitalopram oral solution [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. If the dose is increased to 20 mg, this should occur after a minimum of three weeks. Adults The recommended dose of escitalopram oral solution is 10 mg once daily. A fixed-dose trial of escitalopram oral solution demonstrated the effectiveness of both 10 mg and 20 mg of escitalopram oral solution, but failed to demonstrate a greater benefit of 20 mg over 10 mg [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. If the dose is increased to 20 mg, this should occur after a minimum of one week. Systematic evaluation of continuing escitalopram oral solution 10 or 20 mg/day in adults patients with major depressive disorder who responded while taking escitalopram oral solution during an 8-week, acute-treatment phase demonstrated a benefit of such maintenance treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. 2.2 Generalized Anxiety Disorder Initial Treatment Adults The recommended starting dose of escitalopram oral solution is 10 mg once daily. If the dose is increased to 20 mg, this should occur after a minimum of one week. 2.3 Special Populations 10 mg/day is the recommended dose for most elderly patients and patients with hepatic impairment. If acceptable alternatives to linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are not available and the potential benefits of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of serotonin syndrome in a particular patient, escitalopram oral solution should be stopped promptly, and linezolid or intravenous methylene blue can be administered. The risk of administering methylene blue by non-intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg/kg with escitalopram oral solution is unclear.",,,,,,Oral
