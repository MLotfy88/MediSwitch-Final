Caution is also advised in patients who are dehydrated (e.g., due to severe or prolonged diarrhea or vomiting), since they may be more sensitive to the hypotensive effect of the drugs.  Therapy should be initiated with the lowest dosage possible and titrated gradually based on patient response and tolerance in accordance with the individual product package labeling.  During initiation or reinstitution of therapy and following an increase in dosage, patients should be advised not to rise abruptly from a sitting or recumbent position and to avoid situations where injury could result if syncope occur.  Concomitant use of alcohol, extensive periods of standing, prolonged or intense exercise, and exposure to heat can also precipitate orthostatic hypotension and should be minimized.
