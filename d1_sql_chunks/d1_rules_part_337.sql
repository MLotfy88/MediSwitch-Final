Theoretically, coadministration may increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular effects such as hypotension, hypertension, and arrhythmias due to elevated norepinephrine levels.

Symptoms of the serotonin syndrome may include mental status changes such as irritability, altered consciousness, confusion, hallucinations, and coma; autonomic dysfunction such as tachycardia, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, shivering, blood pressure lability, and mydriasis; neuromuscular abnormalities such as hyperreflexia, myoclonus, tremor, rigidity, and ataxia; and gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.', NULL, 'The use of tapentadol in patients currently receiving or within 14 days of receiving a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) is considered contraindicated.', NULL, 'The use of tapentadol in patients currently receiving or within 14 days of receiving a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) is considered contraindicated.', 'Synergism', 'Viloxazine', 'Naltrexone, Acetaminophen, Ibuprofen, Celecoxib, Acetylsalicylic acid, Naloxone', 'Major', NULL, 'DDInter', 'pharmacodynamic', NULL, 'https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/168745/', '[1] De Vita VT, Hahn MA, Oliverio VT "Monoamine oxidase inhibition by a new carcinostatic agent, n-isopropyl-a-(2-methylhydrazino)-p-toluamide (MIH).
