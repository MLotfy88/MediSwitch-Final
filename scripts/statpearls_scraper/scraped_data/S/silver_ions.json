    "toxicity": "When silver is ingested, approximately 10% is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and circulated by the vasculature. Silver is primarily excreted in bile and eliminated through feces, and to a lesser extent, eliminated in urine.\n[3]\n[8]\nIn today’s society, presentations of generalized argyria are most commonly observed in patients who utilize colloidal silver as a form of complementary health supplementation.\n[9]\nInhaling silver particulates or aerosols leads to the accumulation of silver in the lungs and bloodstream.\n[4]\n[20]\nThe Recommended Exposure Level and Permissible Exposure Level for both are 0.1 mg/m\n3\n, according to the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health established by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration. Contact exposure to silver can occur through wound dressings, jewelry, and nasal or ophthalmologic drops, typically leading to localized argyria. However, contact exposure can still lead to generalized argyria.\n[2]\n[13]"
