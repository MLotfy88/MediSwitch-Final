The exact mechanism of interaction is unclear. Certain systemic reactions stemming from parenteral iron therapy are thought to be mediated by inflammatory substances such as bradykinin in response to iron-catalyzed generation of toxic free radicals. Since ACE inhibitors decrease the breakdown of kinins, it is conceivable that they may potentiate these reactions. Anaphylactic-type reactions, including fatalities, have followed the parenteral administration of iron dextran. Such reactions occur most often within the first several minutes of administration and are generally characterized by sudden onset of respiratory difficulty and/or cardiovascular collapse.

Resuscitation techniques and personnel trained in the detection and treatment of anaphylactic-type reactions should be readily available. Prior to the first therapeutic dose, a test dose corresponding to 25 mg iron should be injected gradually. Although anaphylactic reactions are usually evident within a few minutes, observe patients for at least one hour before administering the remainder of the therapeutic dose. Administration must be stopped immediately if signs of an anaphylactoid reaction are observed. Patients should also be closely monitored during each subsequent administration of iron dextran. Fatal reactions have occurred following the test dose and also in situations where the test dose was tolerated.

Prolonged and severe hypoglycemia may occur, although these events have rarely been reported. Significant increases in blood pressure and bradycardia can also occur during hypoglycemia in diabetics treated with insulin and beta-blockers due to antagonism of epinephrine's effect on beta-2 adrenergic receptors, which leads to unopposed alpha-adrenergic effects including vasoconstriction.

Prolonged and severe hypoglycemia may occur, although these events have rarely been reported. Significant increases in blood pressure and bradycardia can also occur during hypoglycemia in diabetics treated with insulin and beta-blockers due to antagonism of epinephrine's effect on beta-2 adrenergic receptors, which leads to unopposed alpha-adrenergic effects including vasoconstriction.

Preliminary data from a small number of HCV-HIV coinfected patients receiving interferon-ribavirin therapy and different antiretroviral regimens containing stavudine do not support a major clinical impact related to the in vitro effect. However, the potential for diminished antiretroviral activity should be considered, as three patients in one study had an increase in HIV viral load of more than 0.5 log after 3 to 6 months of interferon-ribavirin therapy which led to discontinuation of ribavirin in one.
