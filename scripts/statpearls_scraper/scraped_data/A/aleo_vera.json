    "toxicity": "Older patients and those with cardiovascular disease should have a smaller volume of blood removed during phlebotomy sessions to minimize orthostatic effects. Normal saline may be given post phlebotomy to replace the volume lost. Patients need to stay well-hydrated and limit aggressive physical activity within the first 24 hours of phlebotomy.\n\nHigher dose aspirin (more than 100 mg/day) is associated with an increased risk of bleeding, and 900 mg daily is associated with a high rate of gastrointestinal bleeding.\n[25]\n[19]\n[26]\n\nAdverse effects of hydroxyurea include cytopenias, oral ulcers, GI upset, peripheral neuropathy, and rare but severe pulmonary toxicity. If HU is not tolerated, cytoreductive therapy should be changed to other agents listed above."
