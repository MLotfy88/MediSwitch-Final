The risk is thought to extend to teriflunomide, its principal active metabolite, because recommended dosages of both result in a similar range of plasma concentrations of teriflunomide. Serious infections including sepsis, as well as opportunistic infections like Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis, and aspergillosis have been reported with the use of leflunomide, particularly in patients on concomitant hematotoxic therapy. Agents that may be significantly immuno- or myelosuppressive include antineoplastic agents, radiation, zidovudine, linezolid, some antirheumatic agents, high dosages of corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic agents , and long-term topical or inhaled corticosteroids. Rare cases of pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia have also occurred with leflunomide alone, but were most frequent in the presence of concomitant or recent use of methotrexate or other myelotoxic agents. Due to the prolonged elimination half-life of leflunomide's active metabolite, an interaction may occur even when hematotoxic agents are initiated after the discontinuation of leflunomide. Administering a washout procedure with cholestyramine or activated charcoal helps to accelerate elimination of the active metabolite from plasma and reduce the overlap of systemic exposure to these agents.",

Patients should be advised to contact their physician if they develop signs and symptoms of infection such as fever, chills, diarrhea, sore throat, muscle aches, shortness of breath, blood in phlegm, weight loss, red or inflamed skin, body sores, and pain or burning during urination.

Mipomersen has not been studied with other LDL-lowering agents that can also increase hepatic fat, thus concomitant use is not recommended. Patients treated with mipomersen should have serum ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin measured prior to initiation of treatment and regularly during treatment in accordance with the product labeling, and the dosing adjusted or interrupted as necessary. Since alcohol may increase levels of hepatic fat and induce or exacerbate liver injury, the manufacturer recommends that patients taking mipomersen not consume more than one alcoholic drink per day. Patients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience potential signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as fever, rash, itching, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, malaise, right upper quadrant pain, dark urine, pale stools, and jaundice.",
