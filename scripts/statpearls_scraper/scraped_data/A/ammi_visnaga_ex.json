    "indications": "As an extension of the work exploring radiographic indications, scenarios less likely to need EXIT have also surfaced. A systematic review found that lymphatic malformations, neck masses <3.5 cm, and any size fetal neck masses without anatomic compression or airway displacement are unlikely to present complications needing more than standard intubation after delivery. Therefore, these are relative contraindications to EXIT.\n[7]\nDepending on the confidence and experience of the resuscitation team, the airway surgeon may still be requested in the delivery suite to be ready for bronchoscopy or tracheostomy after delivery. Hard contraindications include any congenital anomaly that indicates fetal nonviability.",
    "clinical_significance": "While not common or well-known in the general medical community, the EXIT procedure is lifesaving to most infants needing airway intervention at the time of delivery. Mortality rates of upper airway malformation, head and neck mass, cardiopulmonary malformations, and other specific congenital maladies have drastically declined after the introduction of appropriate prenatal evaluation, team preparation, and meticulous surgical technique. However, EXIT procedures are not without risk to the mother or child, but the possibility of a healthy delivery typically outweighs these risks.\n[32]"
