In addition, symptomatic hypotension can occur in susceptible individuals, which may compromise renal and myocardial perfusion.  In patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF), treatment with AR antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and, rarely, renal failure, myocardial ischemia, and death.  Therapy with AR antagonists should be initiated cautiously in patients with severe CHF, especially when accompanied by volume and/or sodium depletion.  In patients who experience a decline in renal function, discontinuation of AR antagonist therapy is usually not required provided there is symptomatic improvement of the heart failure and renal deterioration is well-tolerated.  Transient hypotension is also not a contraindication to further treatment with AR antagonists, since therapy can usually be reinstated without difficulty after blood pressure stabilizes.', '2', 'Weber MA, Byyny RL, Pratt JH, Faison EP, Snavely DB, Goldberg AI, Nelson EB "Blood pressure effects of the angiotensin II receptor blocker, losartan."

In addition, symptomatic hypotension can occur in susceptible individuals, which may compromise renal and myocardial perfusion.  In patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF), treatment with AR antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and, rarely, renal failure, myocardial ischemia, and death.  Therapy with AR antagonists should be initiated cautiously in patients with severe CHF, especially when accompanied by volume and/or sodium depletion.  In patients who experience a decline in renal function, discontinuation of AR antagonist therapy is usually not required provided there is symptomatic improvement of the heart failure and renal deterioration is well-tolerated.  Transient hypotension is also not a contraindication to further treatment with AR antagonists, since therapy can usually be reinstated without difficulty after blood pressure stabilizes.', '2', 'Weber MA, Byyny RL, Pratt JH, Faison EP, Snavely DB, Goldberg AI, Nelson EB "Blood pressure effects of the angiotensin II receptor blocker, losartan."

Therapy with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors should be administered cautiously in patients with preexisting myopathy, in those with predisposing factors for myopathy or with a history of myoneural disorder, since it may delay the recognition or confound the diagnosis of a drug-induced musculoskeletal effect.  Patients should be advised to report promptly any unusual muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.

Tolerance to the hypotensive effects often develops after a few doses to a few weeks.  Rarely, fatal cardiac arrest has occurred secondary to severe hypotension.  Other reported adverse cardiovascular effects include hypertension, edema, arrhythmias, thrombophlebitis, myocarditis, angina, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and ECG abnormalities such as PR and QT interval prolongation, diffuse T-wave flattening, and ST segment depression.  Therapy with neuroleptic agents should be administered cautiously in patients with severe cardiovascular disease, pheochromocytoma, a predisposition to hypotension, or conditions that could be exacerbated by hypotension such as a history of myocardial infarction, angina, or ischemic stroke.  Close monitoring of cardiovascular status, including ECG changes, is recommended at all dosages.  If parenteral therapy is given, patients should be in a supine position during administration and for at least 30 to 60 minutes afterwards.  Patients who experience orthostatic hypotension should be cautioned not to rise too abruptly.  Occasionally, when severe, hypotension may require treatment with vasoconstrictive agents such as norepinephrine or phenylephrine.

NMS is observed most frequently when high-potency agents like haloperidol are administered intramuscularly, but may occur with any neuroleptic agent given for any length of time.  Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac arrhythmias).  Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria, and acute renal failure.  Neuroleptic agents should not be given to patients with active NMS and should be immediately discontinued if currently being administered in such patients.

Additional monitoring may be necessary when administering maraviroc to patients with preexisting liver dysfunction or who are coinfected with hepatitis B and/or C virus.  The safety and efficacy of maraviroc has not been studied in patients with significant underlying liver disorders; caution is recommended.', '3', '"Product Information. Selzentry (maraviroc)."
