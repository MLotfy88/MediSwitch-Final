      "text": "Not indicated in\nCrotaline (Pit Vipers)\nbites (ie. rattlesnake).\nConsider plan for extricating the patient\nPatient must be\ncarried\nout of the field once dressing is in place\nThe dressing must\nnot\nbe taken down\nuntil the patient has reached definitive care\n. Removing the dressing may release a bolus of venom and antivenom should be immediately available.",

    "Technique": {
