Hypoglycemia and, less frequently, hyperglycemia have been reported, although the latter may also occur due to infection alone.  Hypoglycemia has usually occurred in patients with diabetes receiving concomitant oral hypoglycemic agents and/or insulin.  Administration of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, norfloxacin, and especially gatifloxacin in patients treated with sulfonylureas or other oral hypoglycemic agents has resulted in severe, refractory hypoglycemia and hypoglycemic coma.  Elderly patients and patients with reduced renal function are particularly susceptible.  Blood glucose should be monitored more closely whenever quinolones are prescribed to patients with diabetes.  Gatifloxacin has been known to cause hypoglycemic episodes generally within the first 3 days of therapy and sometimes even after the first dose, while hyperglycemia usually occurs 4 to 10 days after initiation of therapy.  Patients should be counseled to recognize symptoms of hypoglycemia such as headache, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, tremor, weakness, hunger, excessive perspiration, and palpitations.  If hypo- or hyperglycemia occur during quinolone therapy, patients should initiate appropriate remedial therapy immediately, discontinue the antibiotic, and contact their physician.', '2', '"Product Information.

Hypoglycemia has usually occurred in patients with diabetes receiving concomitant oral hypoglycemic agents and/or insulin.  Administration of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, norfloxacin, and especially gatifloxacin in patients treated with sulfonylureas or other oral hypoglycemic agents has resulted in severe, refractory hypoglycemia and hypoglycemic coma.  Elderly patients and patients with reduced renal function are particularly susceptible.  Blood glucose should be monitored more closely whenever quinolones are prescribed to patients with diabetes.  Gatifloxacin has been known to cause hypoglycemic episodes generally within the first 3 days of therapy and sometimes even after the first dose, while hyperglycemia usually occurs 4 to 10 days after initiation of therapy.  Patients should be counseled to recognize symptoms of hypoglycemia such as headache, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, tremor, weakness, hunger, excessive perspiration, and palpitations.  If hypo- or hyperglycemia occur during quinolone therapy, patients should initiate appropriate remedial therapy immediately, discontinue the antibiotic, and contact their physician.', '2', '"Product Information.

Their use is considered by drug manufacturers to be contraindicated in neonates, particularly premature infants and infants of low birth weight.  When used in bacteriostatic saline intravascular flush and endotracheal tube lavage solutions, benzyl alcohol has been associated with fatalities and severe respiratory and metabolic complications in low-birth-weight premature infants.  Thus, single-dose formulations should always be used in infants whenever possible.  However, many experts feel that, in the absence of benzyl alcohol-free equivalents, the amount of the preservative present in these formulations should not necessarily preclude their use if they are clearly indicated.  The American Academy of Pediatrics considers benzyl alcohol in low doses (such as when used as a preservative in some medications) to be safe for newborns.

CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea after antibacterial use.  Since CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after antibacterial use, careful medical history is necessary.  Therapy with broad-spectrum antibacterials and other agents with significant antibacterial activity should be administered cautiously in patients with history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis; pseudomembranous colitis (generally characterized by severe, persistent diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps, and sometimes associated with the passage of blood and mucus), if it occurs, may be more severe in these patients and may be associated with flares in underlying disease activity.  Antibacterial drugs not directed against C difficile may need to be stopped if CDAD is suspected or confirmed.  Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C difficile, and surgical evaluation should be started as clinically indicated.', '3', '"Product Information.

Imipramine appears to have the greatest propensity to induce these effects, while secondary amines such as nortriptyline may do so less frequently.  Tolerance to the hypotensive effects often develops after a few doses to a few weeks.  Rarely, collapse and sudden death have occurred secondary to severe hypotension.  Other reported adverse cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmias, heart block, hypertension, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, myocardial infarction, strokes, congestive heart failure, and ECG abnormalities such as PR and QT interval prolongation.  Therapy with TCAs should be avoided during the acute recovery phase following myocardial infarction, and should be administered only with extreme caution in patients with hyperthyroidism, a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or a predisposition to hypotension.
