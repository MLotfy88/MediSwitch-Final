    "indications": "The major relative contraindications include the following:\n\nHypersensitivity to 5-HT3 receptor antagonists or any formulation components due to cross-reactivity concerns.\nConcomitant use with apomorphine due to concern for a decreased level of consciousness and hypotension.\n[43]\n\nBox Warnings\n\nThe 5-HT3 receptor antagonist labeling includes a warning about the risk of serotonin syndrome in combination with other serotonergic drugs. However, the evidence is limited.\n[41]\nThe 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are associated with a varying level of QT prolongation based on the agent.\n[2]\nOndansetron ODT contains a small amount of phenylalanine. Patients with phenylketonuria cannot metabolize phenylalanine.\n[44]",
    "mechanism": "Gastric irritation or cellular damage triggers the intestinal release of 5-HT, which binds to 5-HT3 receptors in the GI tract. The activation of the 5-HT3 receptors triggers nausea and vomiting.\n[1]\nSerotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonists inhibit the activation of the 5-HT3 receptors peripherally and centrally, resulting in antiemetic effects.\n[1]\nPalonosetron has a higher binding affinity to the 5-HT3 receptors than the first-generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonists.\n[3]\nAdditional receptors that trigger nausea and vomiting include dopamine D2 receptors, muscarinic M1 cholinergic receptors, histamine H1 receptors, cannabinoid receptors, and neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptors. Therefore, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists do not treat all causes of emesis. Antiemetics with different mechanisms of action target the other receptors.\n[1]\n\nPharmacokinetics\n\nAbsorption:\nOndansetron, granisetron, and dolasetron have a rapid and complete absorption following oral administration.\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n\nDistribution:\nOndansetron has a wide volume of distribution and is about 70% bound to plasma proteins.\n[14]\nGranisetron has a high volume of distribution.\n[15]\n\nMetabolism:\nDifferent enzymes of the CYP-450 enzyme system metabolize each of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists.\n[3]\nPatients with high CYP2D6 enzyme activity are less responsive to 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Ondansetron undergoes hepatic metabolism by CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2. Granisetron undergoes first-pass metabolism by CYP2D6.\n[3]\nOndansetron and granisetron have a bioavailability of 60%.\n[14]\n[15]\nThe bioavailability of ondansetron in cancer patients is slightly higher.\n[14]\n[15]\nSmoking induces the metabolism of granisetron.\n[17]\nDolasetron is a prodrug that undergoes hepatic metabolism to an active metabolite, hydrodolasetron.\n[16]\n[18]\nHydrodolasetron undergoes metabolism by CYP 2D6.\n[3]\nPolanosetron undergoes hepatic metabolism and has a bioavailability of about 97% after oral administration.\n[19]\n\nElimination:\nOndansetron undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism to inactive metabolites.\n[14]\nThe elimination half-life for ondansetron is about 4 hours. Granisetron undergoes 12% renal excretion.\n[15]\nThe elimination half-life for granisetron is about 4 to 6 hours. Dolasetron has a half-life of less than 10 minutes, while hydrodolasetron has a half-life of about 7 hours.\n[3]\nUnchanged dolasetron undergoes less than 1% excretion in the urine.\n[16]\nPolanosetron is longer acting than the first-generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and has an elimination half-life of about 40 hours.\n[19]\n[3]\nPolanosetron undergoes about 80% renal excretion, with 40% of the drug being excreted unchanged.",
    "administration": "5-HT3 receptor antagonists come in various formulations, offering multiple administration routes.\n[20]\nThese include oral tablets, orally disintegrating tablets, oral soluble film, oral solution, intramuscular (IM) injection, intravenous (IV) injection, subcutaneous (SubQ) injection, and transdermal patch.\n[21]\n[22]\nPalonosetron comes in an IV formulation. Ondansetron is available as oral tablets, orally disintegrating tablets, an oral solution, and IV and IM formulations. Dolasetron comes in an oral tablet and IV solution. Granisetron is available as an oral tablet, oral solution, transdermal patch, an IV formulation, and extended-release SubQ injection. The extended-release subcutaneous formulation of granisetron is long-acting and provides a therapeutic drug concentration for up to 5 days post-injection and is effective for delayed CINV, in addition to acute CINV.\n[10]\n\nCommon dosing and administration regimens for adults include, but are not limited to:\n\nOndansetron:\nFor nausea and vomiting prophylaxis, chemotherapy-related:\nIV: (moderately to highly emetogenic chemo): 0.15 mg/kg/dose (maximum 16 mg/dose) every 4 hours for 3 doses.\n[23]\nTreatment should be initiated 30 minutes before chemotherapy\n.\nPO: (highly emetogenic chemo): 24 mg once 30 minutes before chemotherapy; ODT dose forms should not be chewed or crushed\n.\nPO: (moderately emetogenic chemo): 8 mg every 8 hours for 2 doses, then 8 mg every 12 hours until 1 or 2 days after chemotherapy completion. Chemotherapy should be started 30 minutes before. Again, ODT dosage forms should not be cut, crushed, or chewed.\nNausea and vomiting prophylaxis, post-operative: 4 mg intramuscularly (IM) or intravenously (IV) for 1 dose.\n[24]\nNausea and vomiting prophylaxis, radiotherapy-related (total body): 8 mg PO for 1 dose, given 1 to 2 hours before each therapy fraction; ODT dosage forms should not be cut, crushed, or chewed.\n[25]\nGranisetron:\nNausea and vomiting prophylaxis, chemotherapy-related: 10 μg/kg IV 30 minutes before chemotherapy; oral dose within 1 hour before chemo. Alternately, 2 mg PO once or 1 mg PO every 12 hours for 2 doses.\n[15]\nGranisetron should only be administered on the days of chemotherapy\nNausea and vomiting prophylaxis, radiotherapy-related: 2 mg orally for a single dose; treatment should be started within 1 hour of radiotherapy.\n[26]\nNausea and vomiting prophylaxis, post-operative: 5-20 μg/kg IV as a single dose administered at the end of surgery.\n[27]\nPalonosetron:\nNausea and vomiting prevention, chemotherapy-related: 0.25 mg IV for 1 dose, started 30 minutes before chemotherapy.\n[28]\nNausea and vomiting prophylaxis, post-operative: 0.075 mg IV for a single dose, started immediately before anesthesia induction.\n[29]\n\nThe American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines suggest administering granisetron extended-release subcutaneous injection or granisetron transdermal patch to patients undergoing a multiday chemotherapy cycle instead of administering a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist each day of the multiday cycle.\n[30]\n\nSpecial Patient Populations\n\nHepatic impairment:\nOndansetron requires dosage adjustment in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\n[14]\nPalonosetron, dolasetron, and granisetron do not require a hepatic dosage adjustment\n\nRenal adjustment:\nOndansetron, palonosetron, and dolasetron do not require renal dosage adjustment. Granisetron requires renal dosage adjustment and is contraindicated in patients with a creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min.\n\nPregnancy considerations:\nOndansetron for nausea and vomiting: 4 mg PO every 8 hours in pregnant women who are not dehydrated or 8 mg IV every 12 hours to be infused over 15 minutes.\n[31]\n\nOlder patients:\nOndansetron does not require dosage adjustment in older adults.\n[14]",
    "adverse_effects": "The serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonists share a similar safety and tolerability profile.\n[32]\n\nMost Common Adverse Reactions\n[1]\n[33]\n\nHeadache (9% to 27%)\nFatigue (9% to 13%)\nMalaise (9% to 13%)\nConstipation (6% to 11%)\n\nOne Percent to 10%\n\nDrowsiness, sedation, dizziness, agitation, anxiety, paresthesia, the sensation of cold, pruritus, skin rash, diarrhea, gynecologic disease, urinary retention, transient increase (greater than 2-fold) of serum aminotransferases, injection site reaction, hypoxia, fever.\n[34]\n\n5-HT3 receptor antagonists carry a risk of dose-dependent QT prolongation.\n[35]\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning about the risk of QT prolongation associated with a single dose of 32 mg intravenous (IV) ondansetron.\n[35]\nMost published literature shows that the risk of QT prolongation with 5-HT3 antagonists is clinically insignificant in healthy patients. A review of several studies conducted on healthy patients concludes that dolasetron carries the highest risk of QT prolongation, followed by ondansetron and then granisetron.\n[36]\nFurther studies are needed to determine the cardiovascular safety of 5-HT3 antagonists in patients with cancer, polypharmacy, and other cardiotoxic medications.\n[36]\nExperts recommend using the antiemetic agent with the least known QT prolongation, such as polanosetron, in patients at risk of QT prolongation.\n[3]\n\nPregnancy\n\n5-HT3 receptor antagonists are FDA pregnancy category B. Available human studies examining early pregnancy conclude there is not a high risk of congenital malformations. There is a small increased risk of septal defects and cleft palate. Animal studies show no increased risk during early pregnancy. The presence or absence of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in breast milk has not been established. The American Academy of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) guidelines provide a treatment algorithm for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. Ondansetron can be added for patients who remain symptomatic despite the use of a pyridoxine/doxylamine combination along with adjunct therapy.\n[37]\nIn patients without dehydration, the ACOG guideline recommends oral ondansetron. In patients with dehydration receiving IV fluid replacement, the ACOG guideline recommends IV ondansetron.\n\nDrug-Drug Interactions\n\nThe 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are metabolized by different isoenzymes of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) system.\n[38]\n[39]\n[40]\nTherefore, these drugs will likely interact with many prescription or over-the-counter medications and supplements. The clinical significance of the 5-HT3 drug-drug interactions is uncertain because studies are limited.\n[18]\nAn in-vitro study showed that ketoconazole inhibits the metabolism of granisetron.\n[18]\nGranisetron does not inhibit CYP450 enzymes. Ondansetron is metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2 enzymes. Therefore, medications that induce or inhibit these CYP450 isoenzymes alter the metabolism of ondansetron. However, ondansetron dosage adjustment is not recommended. Dolasetron is a prodrug activated by CYP450 enzymes in the liver.\n[18]\nDrug interactions with commonly used chemotherapy drugs are not clinically significant. The manufacturer of dolasetron does not recommend dosage adjustments. The World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Health Canada (HC) requested that manufacturers of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists include the risk of serotonin syndrome in drug labeling.\n[41]\nHowever, there is insufficient evidence that administering 5-HT3 receptor antagonists with other serotonergic drugs contributes to the development of serotonin syndrome. The first-generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, dolasetron, ondansetron, granisetron, and tropisetron, may cause QT prolongation.\n[42]\nPalonosetron does not cause a clinically significant QT prolongation.",
    "monitoring": "Baseline ECG for at-risk patient populations should be obtained, and sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium serum levels should be monitored.\n[45]\n\nArrhythmia\n\n5-HT3 receptor antagonists have been associated with cardiac arrhythmia.\n[46]\nThe risk of arrhythmia with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists increases with the concomitant use of other QT-prolonging agents, intravenous route of administration, and patients with a significant medical history.\n[47]\nHealthcare professionals should use 5-HT3 receptor antagonists with caution in patients with a history of congenital long QT syndrome, ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac disease, electrolyte abnormalities, or concomitant cardiotoxic chemotherapy.\n\nSerotonin Syndrome\n\nEvidence is insufficient to conclude that 5-HT3 receptor antagonists contribute to the development of serotonin syndrome.\n[41]\nHowever, the World Health Organization (WHO), the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Health Canada suggest a risk of serotonin syndrome by using 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in combination with other serotonergic drugs. The package inserts for the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist require healthcare professionals to monitor patients for signs of serotonin syndrome.\n[41]\nSigns and symptoms include mental status changes, autonomic instability, tachycardia, labile blood pressure, diaphoresis, flushing, neuromuscular changes, GI symptoms, and seizures.\n[48]\nIf serotonin syndrome occurs, discontinue 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and initiate supportive management.\n\nConstipation\n\nConstipation is a commonly reported adverse effect with all formulations of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists.\n[49]\nTherefore, healthcare professionals should closely monitor patients at risk of intestinal obstruction.\n[46]",
    "toxicity": "Overdose is rare, and there is no fatal dose yet established. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists have a broad therapeutic index with mild side effects that occur infrequently. There is no antidote for 5-HT3 receptor antagonists.\n[50]\nTherefore, the healthcare team treats patients with supportive therapy, such as IV fluid resuscitation and norepinephrine infusions. In a case report of intentional granisetron overdose, the patient presented with significant hemodynamic instability, characterized by hypotension and ECG changes.\n[50]"
