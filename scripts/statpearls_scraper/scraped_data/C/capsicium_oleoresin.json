    "clinical_significance": "Most missions benefit from preemptive planning, which typically allows enough time to conduct a comprehensive MTA. Planning efforts should aim to mitigate these threats as much as possible. However, tactical teams are often deployed without prior notice. When operations occur with little to no time for premission planning, the TEMS provider must initiate the MTA as soon as feasible. As additional information emerges, developing a thorough and actionable MTA report may become possible. The incident commander should receive a briefing on identified threats, the staging location of EMS personnel, and the expected hospital transport route.\n\nTactical teams encounter numerous challenges in operational environments. Integrating MTAs into routine mission planning allows for the anticipation of potential risks to team health and safety. The TEMS provider's role extends beyond treatment to preventing casualties and contributing to mission success. When feasible, a formal MTA should be conducted before the mission, with key findings communicated to the team commander. An effective TEMS leader supports the team commander and enhances the likelihood of a safe operation for all personnel."
