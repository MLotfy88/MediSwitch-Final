    "indications": "Hydrogen peroxide naturally occurs in the body as a byproduct of cellular respiration. As a chemical, it is used in bleaching, cleansing, and disinfecting processes in households and industries. Household concentrations generally range from 3 to 9% and are most commonly found at 3%. Industrial concentrations can be as high as 70%, most commonly ranging between 27.5 to 70%.\n[1]\n\nHome hydrogen peroxide is often used for cerumen removal, mouthwash, surface or fabric cleansing, and hair bleaching.\n[2]\nIt is often used in the medical field as a disinfectant and irrigation fluid at the bedside and in the operating room.\n[3]\nHigher concentrations of hydrogen peroxide are available in some health food stores as a type of \"hyperoxygenation therapy.\" This has been touted as an effective and safe alternative treatment for everything from cancer to mental illness. However, these formulations are not supported by research to be effective and have caused great harm and even death.\n[4]\n[5]\n\nAs a disinfectant, it rapidly oxidizes, and the resultant free radicals damage proteins, DNA, and cell membrane lipids - both bacteria/viruses and tissue.\n[6]\nHydrogen peroxide may be harmful with dermal or ophthalmic exposure, ingestion, wound or rectal irrigation, injection, or inhalation. The toxicity depends on the solution's concentration type of exposure.\n[2]",
    "mechanism": "When exposed to skin, dilute hydrogen peroxide - as is found in most households, can act as an irritant, and symptoms are generally mild. Symptoms are more significant when exposed to mucous membranes but are still mild. Ophthalmic exposure can be very painful and may cause local injury to the cornea or conjunctiva. Similarly, ingestion of dilute hydrogen peroxide also usually results in milder symptoms and generally presents with possible injury to the mucous membranes, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Toxicity from ingestion usually results from the release of oxygen gas when hydrogen peroxide comes into contact with catalase found in tissues.\n[2]\n[7]\n\nMore concentrated hydrogen peroxide solutions, often found in industrial strength solutions, cause significantly more severe damage with all types of exposures. As a concentrated solution, hydrogen peroxide is classified as caustic and can cause significant chemical burns. Ingestion of concentrated hydrogen peroxide may also cause burns to the mouth, throat, and esophagus, as with ingestion of other caustics. However, it will also release significant amounts of oxygen gas when exposed to the enzyme catalase, which is present in living tissue.\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n\nThis gas is released both in the GI tract and in the bloodstream as hydrogen peroxide passes easily through biological membranes and crosses into nearby blood vessels. If introduced into the bloodstream directly, it releases oxygen gas and can cause significant air emboli, including possible cerebral emboli.\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n\nInhalation of hydrogen peroxide may cause severe issues due to tissue injury and airway irritation leading to potential airway compromise.\n[2]\nFinally, concentrated hydrogen peroxide may be cytotoxic due to lipid peroxidation.\n[3]",
    "monitoring": "The history of any patient presenting with exposure should include what they were exposed to and the route. For hydrogen peroxide, the concentration, route of exposure, and location should be determined. This can help guide the physical exam and further evaluation. Ask about their symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, difficulty breathing, or pain. It is also essential to ask about the timing of the exposure and potential co-ingestions or other exposures.\n[2]\n\nThe physical exam should begin with a close examination for soft tissue injury at the exposure site. This would include erythema of the skin, a whitish discoloration, and ulcers in the mouth. This would also include any evidence of airway compromise, including stridor, drooling, abnormal breath sounds, or swelling of the oropharynx or nasopharynx. A physical exam must also include searching for evidence of gas formation, such as subcutaneous emphysema or abdominal distention. A thorough neurologic exam should be performed due to the risk of air emboli.\n[2]\n[12]\n\nNo specific levels are indicated for hydrogen peroxide toxicity itself. However, clinicians should consider obtaining lab work related to potential complications, such as a complete blood count for significant hematemesis, a metabolic panel, and cardiac enzymes to evaluate for e ischemia. You must also consider co-ingestions as accidental and intentional exposures may be at higher risk for exposure to other potentially toxic chemicals.\n[17]\n[18]\n\nImaging should be performed if there is any concern for air embolization and should focus on the area of concern. CT scans or MRIs should be performed for neurological changes. This would include CT or MRI of the head and/or spine as any of these areas may be affected.\n[11]\n[19]\n[20]\n\nImaging the chest with either X-ray or CT should also be performed for any concerns for mediastinal air or other air emboli, including air in the cardiac ventricles. Consider imaging of the abdomen or pelvis to evaluate inappropriate amounts of air in the GI tract or other potential air emboli, such as air in the portal system.\n[4]",
    "administration": "Treatment depends heavily on the type of exposure and concentration of the solution. There is no antidote for hydrogen peroxide, and dialysis is ineffective. Dilute hydrogen peroxide is much less likely to cause significant symptoms, and many of these exposures may be safely observed at home. Ingestion of large amounts of dilute hydrogen peroxide may cause significant symptoms to bring patients to the emergency department. These may also be generally managed with symptomatic management.\n\nCaregivers can consider a nasogastric tube to drain the stomach if the patient presents early enough. This may also help decompress the GI tract and make the patient more comfortable. Nausea and vomiting are the most common presenting symptoms with these types of exposures, and emesis will often be foamy.\n[12]\n\nAs with other topical exposures, the first treatment will be decontamination. Remove any clothing soaked with hydrogen peroxide. Rinse the area with copious amounts of water or normal saline. If a patient presents after ophthalmic exposure, be sure to remove contact lenses if present. Proceed with irrigation with copious amounts of normal saline.\n[2]\nEvaluate for corneal injury using fluorescein and slit lamp if available. Close follow-up with ophthalmology after injury should be encouraged for further treatment of any corneal injury. Treatment for corneal injury is similar to other corneal or conjunctival injuries.\n[21]\n\nIf exposure involves more concentrated solutions, initial treatment remains decontamination -- if possible. However, symptoms are more likely to be more severe, and patients may require more significant interventions. Early intubation is necessary if there is any concern for airway compromise, as tissue damage is likely to progress and progress rapidly.\n[22]\n[23]\n\nPatients with signs or symptoms of significant air emboli need to obtain relevant imaging quickly. If there is air in the mediastinum or heart, or the patient is hypotensive, and there is suspicion o significant air emboli, place patients in the Trendelenburg position to help prevent blockage of the right ventricular outflow tract by intravascular gas.\n[24]\n\nClinicians should consider hyperbaric therapy in symptomatic patients with evidence of air emboli.\n[4]\n[8]\n[25]\n[26]\nIn very severe cases, patients may require central line placement to allow for the removal of air from the major blood vessels or right ventricle.\n[24]",
    "adverse_effects": "Topical injuries will likely heal with no permanent damage. However, if there are severe chemical burns, the patient should be treated as any other burn patient. They will also be at risk for any of the complications seen in other burn patients, such as scarring, dehydration due to fluid losses, and infections. Ophthalmic injuries may cause severe burns and lead to temporary or permanent vision loss.\n[21]\n\nIngestion can lead to scarring of the esophagus or throat, which may lead to strictures and other similar complications.\n[31]\n[32]\nIf the hydrogen peroxide was absorbed or directly introduced into the bloodstream, air emboli might have formed and caused tissue necrosis. This can lead to various effects depending on where the emboli occurred. The patient may have permanent neurological damage or even death. There have been cases of multiple cerebral emboli that have led to severe and permanent disability, as seen in strokes.\n[33]\n[34]"
