It is available as a trace mineral supplement and over the counter as a lozenge form for a reduced duration of common colds and with decreased symptom severity.

Although it has been nasally administered for treating the common cold, this route of administration has been associated with some cases of anosmia [A32414], [A32409], [A32410], [L2080].

Studies show that zinc may be better absorbed in humans in the gluconate form [A32412], [L2105], however, results from other studies may vary.[A27280, L2082]

Interestingly, zinc supplementation has become a critical intervention for treating diarrheal episodes in children. Studies suggest that administration of zinc along with new low osmolarity oral rehydration solutions/salts (oral rehydration solution), may reduce both the duration and severity of diarrheal episodes for up to 12 weeks [L422].

It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infections along with other antibiotics including [amoxicillin], [clarithromycin], and [metronidazole], for example.[A177271][F4498] Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [omeprazole], [esomeprazole], [lansoprazole], [dexlansoprazole], and [rabeprazole].

Pantoprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cell. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of pantoprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, pantoprazole''s duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as pantoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]

PPIs such as pantoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]

Pantoprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing as rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as pantoprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion.[A177574]','["A02BD04", "A02BD11", "A02BC02"]','[]'),(6283,'Ego mix chocolate 20 pieces','ايجو ميكس شيكولاتة 20 قطعة','56','','','','Company','Piece','قطعة','','1','','','','',977,'2024-07-21',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(6285,'Drosming 3/0.03 mg 21 tabs','دروسمينج 3/0.03مجم 21 قرص','51','','','','P & c labs','Tab','أقراص','0.03 mg','1','','','','',1005,'2024-07-25',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(6286,'Hydrocortisone 1% oint. 20 gm','هيدروكورتيزون 1% مرهم 20 جم','21','12.5','Glucocorticoid','Hydrocortisone acetate','Misr','Oint','مرهم','1%','1','كورتيزون موضعي للعين','this medication is used to treat hemorrhoids and itching/swelling in the rectum and anus. it is also used with other medications to treat certain intestinal problems (such as ulcerative colitis of the rectum and other rectal/anal inflammatory conditions).','6221035007077','',8889,'2025-06-28',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Hydrocortisone, or cortisol, is a glucocorticoid secreted by the adrenal cortex.[A188387] Hydrocortisone is used to treat immune, inflammatory, and neoplastic conditions.[L10529,L10532,L10535,L10538,L7772,L7321] It was discovered in the 1930s by Edward Kendall and named Compound F, or 17-hydroxycorticosterone.[A188420]

It is approved by the FDA to treat advanced ovarian cancer in combination with [carboplatin], metastatic breast cancer in combination with [paclitaxel], non-small cell lung cancer in combination with [cisplatin], and pancreatic cancer as monotherapy.[L32950] It is also being investigated in other cancer and tumour types.','["L01BC05"]','[]'),(6320,'Starf plus 30 caps.','ستارف بلس 30 كبسولة','120','','Multivitamin','Iron+zinc+vit. b6+vit b12+copper+folic acid','Mpco','Cap','كبسولة','','3','','','','',688,'2022-12-15',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(6321,'Raw maca 750mg 90 capsules (now)','رو ماكا 750مجم 90 كبسولة','1,800','','','','Now','Capsule','كبسولة','750mg','1','','','','',874,'2022-12-01',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(6322,'Charcoval 30 h.g.c','شاركوفال 30 كبسولة','147','135','Antispasmodic and carminative','Activated charcoal+fennel+caraway+chamomile+ginger+anise','Elixa pharma','Unknown','غير محدد','','3','','','','',795,'2025-08-17',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(6323,'Gemis cook life massage cream 75gm','جيميس كوك لايف مساج كريم 75 جم','190','','Massage cream','Menthol+camphor oil+cinnamon oil+mentha piperita+other natural soothing and analgesic ingredients','Gemis cook','Cream','كريم','75gm','1','','','','',776,'2025-07-29',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(6324,'Sly soyavo cap','سلي سويافو كبسول','199','','Joint arthritis','Soya beans+avocado','Elsaid saliy pharma','Cap','كبسولة','','1','','','','',775,'2022-08-14',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(6325,'Melatime sun screen spf50+ cream gel 120 gm','ميلاتايم صنسكرين اس بي اف 50+ كريم جل 120 جم','550','','Sun block','','Leap cosmeceuticals','Cream','كريم','120 gm','1','','','','',762,'2025-07-29',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(6326,'Mpco lyte 360 ml syrup','مبكو لايت شراب 360 مل','55','','O r s','Potassium+440 mg chloride+370 mg sodium+2.8 mg zinc','Mpco','Syrup','شراب','360 ml','1','','','','',688,'2022-09-01',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(6327,'Amazon ivy syrup 120','امازون ايفي شراب 120 مل','55','','','','Company','Syrup','شراب','','1','','','6224002280084','',594,'2022-08-17',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(6328,'Vacation whitening facial cleansing foam 200ml','فاكيشن وايتننج منظف للوجه فوم 200 مل','295','','Skin care.whitening','Ceramide+alpha arbutin+hyaluronic acid+vitamin e+vitamin c+tea tree oil+glycerin+panthenol+almond oil','Majestic biopharma','Foam','فوم','200ml','1','','','','',606,'2022-08-17',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(6329,'Pointzam 30 tabs','بوينتزام 30 قرص','480','','','','Hayat pharma','Tab','أقراص','','1','','','','',671,'2022-08-17',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(6330,'Vacation whitening night care gel 60 ml','فاكيشن وياتننج نايت كير جل 60 مل','245','','Skin care.whitening','Hyaluronic acid+hydrolyzed collagen+caviar extract+glabridin+kojic acid+alpha arbutin+liquorice extract+vitamin e+vitamin b complex+vitamin c','Majestic biopharma','Gel','جل','60 ml','1','','','','',675,'2025-07-29',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(6331,'Soz act-plus soothing ointment 30 gm','سوز اكت بلس مرهم 30 جم','160','','Cosmetic','Beta-sitosterol+bisabolol+arbutin+retinyl palmitate+honey+beeswax+bht+triethanolamine+peg-8+stearic acid+polysorbate 20+chlorhexidine+methylparaben+aloe barbadensis extract+chamomilla recutita flowe extract+panthenol+dimethicone+allantoin+petrolatum+paraffinumliquidum+hydrogenated soybean oil','Actio pharm','Ointment','مرهم','30 gm','1','','','','',599,'2022-08-17',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(6332,'Rivabedax 10 mg 30 tabs','ريفابيداكس 10مجم 30 قرص','260','','','Rivaroxaban','Averos pharma','Tab','أقراص','10 mg','3','','','','',1056,'2025-07-30',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Rivaroxaban is an anticoagulant and the first orally active direct factor Xa inhibitor.

Indometacin was first discovered in 1963 and it was first approved for use in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration in 1965, [A486] along with other acetic acid derivatives such as [diclofenac] and [sulindac] that were also developed during the 1960s.[A177871] Since then, indometacin has been extensively studied in clinical trials as one of the most potent NSAIDs in blocking prostaglandin synthesis and was among the first NSAIDs to be used in the symptomatic treatment of migraine and for headaches that eventually became known as “indomethacin-responsive” headache disorders.[A177871]

Thiazide-like diuretics such as indapamide are a valuable tool for the treatment of hypertension and continue to grow in popularity, falling behind only ACE inhibitors in terms of prescription frequency.[A204134] When compared to [hydrochlorothiazide] (another commonly prescribed diuretic), indapamide has been shown to be superior at lowering systolic blood pressure, reducing left ventricular mass index, lowering oxidative stress, inhibiting platelet aggregation, and reducing microalbuminuria associated with diabetes.[A204134] Interestingly, unlike thiazide diuretics, several sources suggest that indapamide is not associated with glucose or lipid disturbances.[A204134,A204161]

Although deemed effective in reducing ocular inflammation in clinical studies, topical NSAIDs were also associated with a potential reduction in corneal sensitivity accompanied by an increased risk of superficial punctate keratitis and subjective symptoms of discomfort, including pain, burning or pricking, or a tingling sensation after instillation into the cul‐de‐sac.[A177949]','["S01CC02", "M01AB51", "S01BC01", "M02AA23", "M01AB01", "C01EB03"]','[]'),(6459,'Hpg cranberry 30 caps.','اتش بي جي كرانبيري 30 كبسولة','300','','Uti infections','Cranberry','Treat international pharma','Cap','كبسولة','','3','','','','',903,'2025-08-06',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Cranberry allergenic extract is used in allergenic testing.','[]','[]'),(6462,'Omegal woman 30 caps.','اوميجال وومن 30 كبسولة','300','','Supplement, antioxidant, antiinflammatory,energy production','Omega 3 (dha+epa)+coenzyme(q10)','Xeediapharma','Cap','كبسولة','','1','','','6224010509658','',970,'2025-08-06',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(6463,'Infapro 30 tabs.','انفابرو 30 قرص','60','','Anemia.iron supplement combined with folic acid and calcium','Folic acid+iron+calcium','Egpi','Tab','أقراص','','3','مكمل غذائي غني بالحديد والكالسيوم وحمض الفوليك لعلاج الأنيميا','','','',1428,'2022-05-31',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(6464,'Cosimprel 5/10 mg 15 f.c. tabs.','كوسيمبريل 5 مجم / 10 مجم 15 قرص','140','93','Beta blocker+ace inhibitor','Bisoprolol+perindopril','Servier','Tab','أقراص','10 mg','1','','','6223003961398','',3215,'2025-05-08',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(6465,'Infarca 50mg 20 f.c.tab.','انفاركا 50مجم 20 قرص','51','','Antiplatelet.phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor','Cilostazol','Debeiky > zad','Tab','أقراص','50mg','2','','description cilostazol is a medication used in the alleviation of the symptom of intermittent claudication in individuals with peripheral vascular disease. it is manufactured by otsuka pharmaceutical co. under the trade name pletal. although drugs similar','','',1223,'2022-10-14',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Cilostazol is a quinolinone derivative and antiplatelet agent with vasodilating properties that has been used in the symptomatic treatment of intermittent claudication in patients with peripheral ischaemia.

It was initially approved by the FDA in 1991 [A174175].

It is primarily used for the treatment of respiratory, enteric and genitourinary infections and may be used instead of other macrolides for some sexually transmitted and enteric infections. It is structurally related to erythromycin [A174169].

Azithromycin [9-deoxo-9a-aza-9a-methyl-9a-homoerythromycin] is a part of the _azalide_ subclass of macrolides, and contains a 15-membered ring, with a methyl-substituted nitrogen instead of a carbonyl group at the 9a position on the aglycone ring, which allows for the prevention of its metabolism. This differentiates azithromycin from other types of macrolides [A174175].

In March 2020, a small study was funded by the French government to investigate the treatment of COVID-19 with a combination of azithromycin and the anti-malaria drug [hydroxychloroquine]. The results were positive, all patients taking the combination were virologically cured within 6 days of treatment, however, larger studies are required.[A192546]','["J01RA07", "S01AA26", "J01FA10"]','[]'),(6469,'Infex 100mg 60 f.c.tab.','انفكس 100مجم 60 قرص','54','48','Antiviral.uncoating inhibitor','Amantadine','Marcyrl co. > merz','Tab','أقراص','100mg','6','','(indications) : this medication is a synthetic anti-viral and antiparkinson agent prescribed for parkinson s disease and also for treating certain types of flu. it also is used to prevent and treat respiratory infections caused by influenza a virus (dosag','6223003570316','',1765,'2024-11-27',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'An antiviral that is used in the prophylactic or symptomatic treatment of influenza A.

Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Rosuvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [simvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] This is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than [atorvastatin]''s effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial[A181427] concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.

Rosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]','["C10BX10", "C10BX05", "C10BX07", "C10AA07", "A10BH52", "G01AE10", "C10BX13", "C10BX09", "C10BA09", "C10BX16", "C10BX17", "C10BX14", "C10BA06"]','[]'),(6600,'Gonabe 20 capsules','جونابي 20 كبسولة','210','165','Multivitamin','Vitamin b6+b9+b12+vitamin d3+alpha lipoic acid+benfotiamine','Hi-health pharmaceutical','Capsule','كبسولة','','2','','','','',1983,'2025-10-05',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(6601,'Glucose 5% (gypto) i.v. inf. 500 ml (silicon cap)','جلوكوز 5% جيبتو محلول وريدي زجاجة 500 مل بغطاء سيليكون','30','','Sterile solution','Glucose (dextrose)','Gypto pharma','Cap','كبسولة','5%','1','','','','',949,'2025-08-08',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'A10B',NULL),(6602,'Glucoless 3mg 20 tabs.','جلوكوليس 3مجم 20 قرص','16','','Anti-diabetic.secretagogues.sulfonylurea','Glimepiride','October pharma','Tab','أقراص','3mg','2','','','','',916,'2025-08-08',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'First introduced in 1995, glimepiride is a member of the second-generation sulfonylurea (SU) drug class used for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to improve glycemic control. Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder with increasing prevalences worldwide; it is characterized by insulin resistance in accordance with progressive β cell failure and long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications that lead to co-morbidities and mortalities. Sulfonylureas are one of the insulin secretagogues widely used for the management of type 2 diabetes to lower blood glucose levels. The main effect of SUs is thought to be effective when residual pancreatic β-cells are present,[A177715] as they work by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreatic beta cells and they are also thought to exert extra-pancreatic effects, such as increasing the insulin-mediated peripheral glucose uptake.[A177709] 

Glimepiride works by stimulating the secretion of insulin granules from pancreatic islet beta cells by blocking ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATPchannels) and causing depolarization of the beta cells. Compared to [glipizide], another second SU drug, glimepiride has a longer duration of action. It is sometimes classified as a third-generation SU because it has larger substitutions than other second-generation SUs.[A177703] Compared to other SUs, glimepiride was associated with a lower risk of developing hypoglycemia and weight gain in clinical trials [A177709] as well as fewer cardiovascular effects than other SUs due to minimal effects on ischemic preconditioning of cardiac myocytes.[A177703] It is effective in reducing fasting plasma glucose, postprandial glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin levels and is considered to be a useful, cost-effective treatment option for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus.[A177703] Glimepiride was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States in 1995 for the treatment of T2DM.

Rosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]','["C10BX10", "C10BX05", "C10BX07", "C10AA07", "A10BH52", "G01AE10", "C10BX13", "C10BX09", "C10BA09", "C10BX16", "C10BX17", "C10BX14", "C10BA06"]','[]'),(6622,'Isoptin 5mg/2ml 5 i.v. amp.','ايسوبتن 5 مجم/2مل 5 آمبولات','23','','Antihypertensive.cardioselective calcium chennel blocker','Verapamil','Abbott laboratories','Amp','أمبول','5mg','5','','','','',2018,'2022-10-27',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Verapamil is a phenylalkylamine calcium channel blocker used in the treatment of high blood pressure, heart arrhythmias, and angina,[L8791] and was the first calcium channel antagonist to be introduced into therapy in the early 1960s.[A188514] It is a member of the non-dihydropyridine class of calcium channel blockers, which includes drugs like [diltiazem] and [flunarizine], but is chemically unrelated to other cardioactive medications.[L8791] Verapamil is administered as a racemic mixture containing equal amounts of the S- and R-enantiomer, each of which is pharmacologically distinct - the S-enantiomer carries approximately 20-fold greater potency than the R-enantiomer, but is metabolized at a higher rate.[A188435]','["C09BB10", "C08DA51", "C08DA01"]','[]'),(6625,'Isoptin 80 mg 30 f.c. tabs.','ايسوبتن 80مجم 30 قرص','50','28','Antihypertensive cardio selective calcium channel blocker','Verapamil','Kahira','Tab','أقراص','80 mg','3','علاج ارتفاع ضغط الدم','','8002660037657','',3667,'2024-11-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Verapamil is a phenylalkylamine calcium channel blocker used in the treatment of high blood pressure, heart arrhythmias, and angina,[L8791] and was the first calcium channel antagonist to be introduced into therapy in the early 1960s.[A188514] It is a member of the non-dihydropyridine class of calcium channel blockers, which includes drugs like [diltiazem] and [flunarizine], but is chemically unrelated to other cardioactive medications.[L8791] Verapamil is administered as a racemic mixture containing equal amounts of the S- and R-enantiomer, each of which is pharmacologically distinct - the S-enantiomer carries approximately 20-fold greater potency than the R-enantiomer, but is metabolized at a higher rate.[A188435]','["C09BB10", "C08DA51", "C08DA01"]','[]'),(6626,'Fortiscarnil 50ml serum','فورتيسكارنيل سيروم 50 مل','600','','Anti scar serum','Cb12-bht-vitamin a-propolis-edta','Registry pharma co','Serum','سيروم','50ml','1','','','','',756,'2025-08-08',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(6627,'Isoptin retard 240mg 30 f.c.tab.','ايسوبتن ريتارد 240مجم 30 قرص','170','97.5','Antihypertensive.cardioselective calcium chennel blocker','Verapamil','Kahira > abbott laboratories','Tab','أقراص','240mg','3','علاج ارتفاع ضغط الدم','','8002660037664','',4692,'2025-01-02',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Verapamil is a phenylalkylamine calcium channel blocker used in the treatment of high blood pressure, heart arrhythmias, and angina,[L8791] and was the first calcium channel antagonist to be introduced into therapy in the early 1960s.[A188514] It is a member of the non-dihydropyridine class of calcium channel blockers, which includes drugs like [diltiazem] and [flunarizine], but is chemically unrelated to other cardioactive medications.[L8791] Verapamil is administered as a racemic mixture containing equal amounts of the S- and R-enantiomer, each of which is pharmacologically distinct - the S-enantiomer carries approximately 20-fold greater potency than the R-enantiomer, but is metabolized at a higher rate.[A188435]','["C09BB10", "C08DA51", "C08DA01"]','[]'),(6629,'Isopto atropine 1% eye drops 5 ml','ايزوبتو اتروبين 1% نقط للعين 5 مل','13','','Antimuscarinic.antispasmodic','Atropine sulphate','Novartis > novartis scientific office','Drops','نقط','1%','1','تقليل الالام بالعين -- تقليل الاحمرار والتورم والالتهاب بالعين','description : an alkaloid originally from atropa belladonna but found in other plants mainly solanaceae. indication : for the treatment of poisoning by susceptible organophosphorous nerve agents having cholinesterase activity as well as organophosphorous','5413895003073','',1138,'2022-12-06',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'A03BA01',NULL);

Furthermore, in 2009 the US FDA approved milnacipran for the additional indication of treating fibromyalgia [F3925], although other regional regulatory authorities like the EMA, among others, have not yet approved the agent for such treatment, citing lack of robust evidence of efficacy, insufficient demonstration of maintenance of effect, and other concerns [F3928, F3934]. Nevertheless, milnacipran demonstrates a somewhat unique characteristic among SNRIs to elicit a relatively balanced reuptake inhibition of both serotonin and noradrenaline, with a somewhat increased preference for noradrenaline reuptake inhibition - which is potentially a point of interest given the plausible proposal that noradrenaline plays an important role in the mitigation of pain signals in the descending inhibitory pain pathways in the brain and spinal cord [A175759, A175843, A175846].

Moreover, recent research has shown that the levorotatory enantiomer of milnacipran, levomilnacipran, may have the capacity to inhibit the activity of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1), which has investigationally been associated with β-amyloid plaque formation - making the agent a possible course of treatment for Alzheimer''s disease [A175957].','["N06AX17"]','[]'),(6694,'I.z. globin 30 cap','اي زد جلوبين 30 كبسولة','75','','Anemia','Iron','Pharo pharma','Cap','كبسولة','','3','مكمل غذائي غني بالحديد','','6221094089021','',2630,'2022-12-06',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'A metallic element found in certain minerals, in nearly all soils, and in mineral waters.

More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Rosuvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [simvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] This is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than [atorvastatin]''s effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial[A181427] concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.

Rosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]','["C10BX10", "C10BX05", "C10BX07", "C10AA07", "A10BH52", "G01AE10", "C10BX13", "C10BX09", "C10BA09", "C10BX16", "C10BX17", "C10BX14", "C10BA06"]','[]'),(6743,'Justin blue hair shampoo 175 ml','جاستن بلو شامبو 175 مل','360','290','Hair care','Selenium sulfide+piroctone olamine+rosemary ext.','Kato prestige > egypharma','Amp','أمبول','175 ml','1','','anti-dandruff hair shampoo','6224000870164','',2229,'2024-04-20',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(6744,'Farmactive pu foam non adhesive dressing 10x10 cm','فارماكتيف بي يو فوم نون ادهيسف دريسنج 10 * 10 سم','260','8.75','Skin care.healing','','Elegant care group','Foam','فوم','','1','','','','',828,'2025-08-13',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(6746,'D3 source','دي3 سورس','55','','Vitamin d3','Vitamin d3','Health palace pharma','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',868,'2025-08-13',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(6748,'Fast&up l-arginine 1500 mg 20 eff. tabs.','فاست اند اب 1500 مجم 20 قرص فوار','195','','Amino acid','L-arginine','','Tab','أقراص','1500 mg','2','','','','',793,'2025-08-13',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(6749,'silirase gel 50 gm','سيليريز جل 50 جم','750','690','Scar','dimethicone+cyclopentasiloxane','prt scientific office','gel','جل','50 gm','1','','','','',881,'2026-01-01',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(6751,'Farmactive pu foam non adhesive dressing 10x15 cm','فارماكتيف بي يوم فوم نون ادهيسف دريسنج 10 * 15 سم','270','','Skin care.healing','','Elegant care group','Foam','فوم','','1','','','','',912,'2025-08-13',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(6752,'Desantte oral drops adults 25 ml','ديسانت نقط فم للكبار 25 مل','60','','Dietary supplement','Cholecalciferol(vitamin d3)','Company','Drops','نقط','25 ml','1','','','','',789,'2023-01-12',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Vitamin D, in general, is a secosteroid generated in the skin when 7-dehydrocholesterol located there interacts with ultraviolet irradiation - like that commonly found in sunlight [L5689].

Structurally, ergocalciferol differs from cholecalciferol in that it possesses a double bond between C22 and C23 and has an additional methyl group at C24 [L5689]. Finally, ergocalciferol is pharmacologically less potent than cholecalciferol, which makes vitamin D3 the preferred agent for medical use [L5689].

Appropriate levels of vitamin D must be upheld in the body in order to maintain calcium and phosphorus levels in a healthy physiologic range to sustain a variety of metabolic functions, transcription regulation, and bone metabolism [A223, L5689, L1782, L5771, F4027, F4042, F4048].

The result of doing so allows cGMP present in both the penis and pulmonary vasculature to elicit smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation that subsequently facilitates relief in pulmonary arterial hypertension and the increased flow of blood into the spongy erectile tissue of the penis that consequently allows it to grow in size and become erect and rigid [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

Interestingly enough, it is precisely via this mechanism why sildenafil was at first researched as a potential treatment for angina - or chest pain associated with inadequate blood flow to the heart - before being serendipitously indicated for treating erectile dysfunction in the late 1980s [A175732]. Nevertheless, it is because of this mechanism that sildenafil is also indicated for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension but is also additionally notorious for interacting with various anti-anginal or anti-hypertensive agents to develop potentially rapid, excessive, and/or fatal hypotensive crises [A175579, A175582, A175654].

The result of doing so allows cGMP present in both the penis and pulmonary vasculature to elicit smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation that subsequently facilitates relief in pulmonary arterial hypertension and the increased flow of blood into the spongy erectile tissue of the penis that consequently allows it to grow in size and become erect and rigid [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

Interestingly enough, it is precisely via this mechanism why sildenafil was at first researched as a potential treatment for angina - or chest pain associated with inadequate blood flow to the heart - before being serendipitously indicated for treating erectile dysfunction in the late 1980s [A175732]. Nevertheless, it is because of this mechanism that sildenafil is also indicated for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension but is also additionally notorious for interacting with various anti-anginal or anti-hypertensive agents to develop potentially rapid, excessive, and/or fatal hypotensive crises [A175579, A175582, A175654].

The result of doing so allows cGMP present in both the penis and pulmonary vasculature to elicit smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation that subsequently facilitates relief in pulmonary arterial hypertension and the increased flow of blood into the spongy erectile tissue of the penis that consequently allows it to grow in size and become erect and rigid [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

Interestingly enough, it is precisely via this mechanism why sildenafil was at first researched as a potential treatment for angina - or chest pain associated with inadequate blood flow to the heart - before being serendipitously indicated for treating erectile dysfunction in the late 1980s [A175732]. Nevertheless, it is because of this mechanism that sildenafil is also indicated for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension but is also additionally notorious for interacting with various anti-anginal or anti-hypertensive agents to develop potentially rapid, excessive, and/or fatal hypotensive crises [A175579, A175582, A175654].

Regardless, sildenafil, among a variety of other similar or related PDE5 inhibitors, has become a common and effective treatment for erectile dysfunction and since its formal approval for medical use in the public in 1998 [A175732], continues to see millions of prescriptions written for it internationally. Although the medication has historically been most popularly recognized as Pfizer''s brand name Viagra, sildenafil is currently available generically and even as a non-prescription over the counter medication in some countries [L5656].','["G01AE10", "G04BE03"]','[]'),(6813,'Sly-impress moisturizing & soothing 30 ml nasal spray','سلي امبريس سبراي ملطف ومرطب للانف 30 مل','80','','Nasal spray','Natural isotonic sea water+hyaluronic acid+vit a+vit e+aloevera+panthenol+rosemary+eucalyptus oil+menthol','Elsaid saliy pharma','Spray','بخاخ','30 ml','1','1- مرطب وملطف لأغشية وخلايا الأنف.','','','',1714,'2022-08-10',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(6814,'Diclovance 100mg 20 tabs','ديكلوفانس 100مجم 20 قرص','44','','','Diclofenac sodium','Company','Tab','أقراص','100mg','2','','','','',739,'2022-08-10',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Diclofenac is a phenylacetic acid derivative and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).[label] NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and-2 which are the enzyme responsible for producing prostaglandins (PGs).

More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Rosuvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [simvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] This is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than [atorvastatin]''s effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial[A181427] concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.

Rosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]','["C10BX10", "C10BX05", "C10BX07", "C10AA07", "A10BH52", "G01AE10", "C10BX13", "C10BX09", "C10BA09", "C10BX16", "C10BX17", "C10BX14", "C10BA06"]','[]'),(6845,'Epirovastin 20 mg 7 f.c. tab','ابيروفاستين 20مجم 7 اقراص','38','','Antihyperlipidemic.statins','Rosuvastatin','Eipico','Tab','أقراص','20 mg','1','','','','',833,'2025-08-16',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Rosuvastatin, also known as the brand name product Crestor, is a lipid-lowering drug that belongs to the statin class of medications, which are used to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and manage elevated lipid levels by inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver.

More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Rosuvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [simvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] This is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than [atorvastatin]''s effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial[A181427] concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.

Rosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]','["C10BX10", "C10BX05", "C10BX07", "C10AA07", "A10BH52", "G01AE10", "C10BX13", "C10BX09", "C10BA09", "C10BX16", "C10BX17", "C10BX14", "C10BA06"]','[]'),(6862,'Ejadaxtin 60 mg 3 f.c. tabs.','ايجاداكستين 60مجم 3 اقراص','30','','','Dapoxetine','Wadi elneel benta','Tab','أقراص','60 mg','3','','','','',867,'2025-08-16',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'G04BX14',NULL),(6863,'Egyhusten 120 ml syrup','ايجيهاستن شراب 120 مل','55','','Dietary supplement','Ivy leaf extract+licorice root extract+thyme leaf extract','Egybiotics','Syrup','شراب','120 ml','1','','','','',749,'2025-08-16',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(6864,'Ketam 500mg/10ml vial','كيتام 500مجم/10مل فيال','51','21.5','General anaesthesia','Ketamine','Eipico','Vial','فيال','500mg','1','','','','',2127,'2025-01-04',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist with a potent anesthetic effect.[A31869] It was developed in 1963 as a replacement for phencyclidine (PCP) by Calvin Stevens at Parke Davis Laboratories.

Having been developed in the 1980s by GlaxoSmithKline and approved by the US FDA since January 1991, ondansetron has demonstrated a long history of use and efficacy.

Apart from its main FDA-approved indications, diltiazem has also been used for numerous off-label indications, such as anal fissures (in topical formulations), migraine prophylaxis, pulmonary hypertension, and rest-related cramps in the lower extremities.[L6289] Typically available in extended-release oral and intravenous formulations, diltiazem is marketed under various brand names with Cardizem and Tiazac being the most common ones.','["C08DB01", "C05AE03"]','[]'),(6927,'Kids formula 250 gram powder','كيدز فورميولا 250 جم باودر','126','64','Dietary supplement','Skimmed milk+whey protein+maltodextrine+sucrose+sodium caseinate+natural flavour','Eagle pharma','Powder','بودرة','','1','','','','',881,'2024-06-26',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(6928,'Diglifloz plus 10/1000mg 30 f.c. tabs.','ديجليفلوز بلس 10/1000مجم 30 قرص','306','19.2','Anti-diabetic.secretagogues.sglt2 inhibitors','Dapagliflozin+metformin','Marcyrl pharmaceutical industries (mpi)','Tab','أقراص','1000mg','3','','','','',934,'2025-08-16',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(6930,'Diclac-n 4% gel 50 gm','ديكلاك ان 4% جل 50 جم','72','55','Nsaid.acetic acid derivatives','Diclofenac sodium','Novartis','Gel','جل','4%','1','','','6223002642908','',937,'2025-11-25',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Diclofenac is a phenylacetic acid derivative and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).[label] NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and-2 which are the enzyme responsible for producing prostaglandins (PGs).

Diclofenac was the product of rational drug design based on the structures of [phenylbutazone], [mefenamic acid], and [indomethacin].[A180796] The addition of two chlorine groups in the ortho position of the phenyl ring locks the ring in maximal torsion which appears to be related to increased potency. It is often used in combination with [misoprostol] to prevent NSAID-induced gastric ulcers.

It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infections along with other antibiotics including [DB01060], [DB01211], and [DB00916], for example.[A177271, F4498] Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [DB00338], [DB00213], [DB00448], [DB05351], and [DB01129]. Esomeprazole is the s-isomer of [DB00338], which is a racemate of the S- and R-enantiomer. Esomeprazole has been shown to inhibit acid secretion to a similar extent as [DB00338], without any significant differences between the two compounds _in vitro_. 

Esomeprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of esomeprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, esomeprazole''s duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]

PPIs such as esomeprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as esomeprazole has been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients such as iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]

Rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as esomeprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion.[A177574] Esomeprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing to prevent this rebound effect.','["A02BD06", "A02BC05", "M01AE52"]','[]'),(6974,'Angioblock mono 300 mg 30 f.c. tabs.','انجيوبلوك مونو 300 مجم 30 قرص','113','','Anti-hypertensive.angiotensin blocker','Irbesartan','Global advanced pharmaceuticals (gap)','Tab','أقراص','300 mg','3','','','','',761,'2022-11-08',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Irbesartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) indicated to treat hypertension or diabetic nephropathy.[L7456,L7459] It can also be used as part of a combination product with [hydrochlorothiazide] for patients not well controlled or not expected to be well controlled on monotherapy.[L7459] Unlike angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, ARBs are not associated with a dry cough.[L7456,L7459]

More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Rosuvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [simvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] This is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than [atorvastatin]''s effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial[A181427] concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.

Clinical trials have determined that this drug reduces glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels and reduces body weight, proving to be effective for patients with type 2 diabetes.[A186053] In June 2021, semaglutide was approved by the FDA for chronic weight management in adults with general obesity or overweight who have at least one weight-related condition, marking semaglutide as the first approved drug for such use since 2014.[L34485] The use of semaglutide in weight management is also approved by Health Canada [L39347] and the EMA.[L41335]','["A10BJ06"]','[]'),(6997,'Alka-misr alkaline wash powder 12 sachets','الكا-مصر غسول قلوي بودرة 12 كيس','40','28','Nasal/vaginal wash','Borax+sodium bicarbonate+sodium chloride','Misr > al delta pharmaceuticals trading co.','Powder','بودرة','','1','','','6224009706037','',2291,'2025-01-15',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(6998,'Krema-rosa 100mg 6 vag. tabs.','كريما روزا 100مجم 6 أقراص مهبلية','11','','Antifungals.imidazoles','Clotrimazole','Eipico','Tab','أقراص','100mg','1','','','6221032115355','',996,'2022-12-06',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'This drug is a broad spectrum antimycotic or antifungal agent.

It is classified as a serotonin modulator and stimulator (SMS) as it has a multimodal mechanism of action towards the serotonin neurotransmitter system whereby it simultaneously modulates one or more serotonin receptors and inhibits the reuptake of serotonin. More specifically, vortioxetine acts via the following biological mechanisms: as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) through inhibition of the serotonin transporter, as a partial agonist of the 5-HT1B receptor, an agonist of 5-HT1A, and an antagonist of the 5-HT3, 5-HT1D, and 5-HT7 receptors. SMSs were developed because there are many different subtypes of serotonin receptors, however, not all of these receptors appear to be involved in the antidepressant effects of SRIs. Some serotonin receptors seem to play a relatively neutral or insignificant role in the regulation of mood, but others, such as 5-HT1A autoreceptors and 5-HT7 receptors, appear to play an oppositional role in the efficacy of SRIs in treating depression.','["N06AX26"]','[]'),(7004,'Kupan 25mg 20 tab.','كيوبان 25 مجم 20 قرص','9','','Nsaid.propionic acid derivatives','Ketoprofen','Hikma pharma > chemipharm','Tab','أقراص','25mg','2','','','','',850,'2023-01-12',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Ketoprofen, a propionic acid derivative, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAIA) with analgesic and antipyretic properties.','["M01AE03", "M02AA10", "M01AE53"]','[]'),(7005,'Kupan 50mg 20 caps.','كيوبان 50مجم 20 كبسولة','20','7','Nsaid.propionic acid derivatives','Ketoprofen','Hikma pharma > chemipharm','Cap','كبسولة','50mg','2','','','','',972,'2024-12-28',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Ketoprofen, a propionic acid derivative, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAIA) with analgesic and antipyretic properties.','["M01AE03", "M02AA10", "M01AE53"]','[]'),(7006,'K-uy super gel','كيه-يو واي سوبر جل','12','','Lubricating jelly','Eicosapentaenoic acid','Eco','Gel','جل','','1','مزلق و ملين للجلد لمنع الاحتكاك والالتهابات','','','',1819,'2022-08-18',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(7008,'K-viton 10mg 20 sugar coated tab.','ك-فيتون 10مجم 20 قرص','14','7.5','Vitamin k','Vitamin k4','Kahira','Tab','أقراص','10mg','2','','','6221068000373','',1656,'2024-12-08',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL);

Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, protecting cell membranes from oxidative damage[A176104]. The antioxidant effects are currently being researched for use in the treatment of diseases causing bone loss, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and associated comorbidities, eye diseases, inflammatory diseases (including skin conditions), lipid disorders, neurological diseases, and radiation damage[A176369].

The result of doing so allows cGMP present in both the penis and pulmonary vasculature to elicit smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation that subsequently facilitates relief in pulmonary arterial hypertension and the increased flow of blood into the spongy erectile tissue of the penis that consequently allows it to grow in size and become erect and rigid [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

Interestingly enough, it is precisely via this mechanism why sildenafil was at first researched as a potential treatment for angina - or chest pain associated with inadequate blood flow to the heart - before being serendipitously indicated for treating erectile dysfunction in the late 1980s [A175732]. Nevertheless, it is because of this mechanism that sildenafil is also indicated for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension but is also additionally notorious for interacting with various anti-anginal or anti-hypertensive agents to develop potentially rapid, excessive, and/or fatal hypotensive crises [A175579, A175582, A175654].

Regardless, sildenafil, among a variety of other similar or related PDE5 inhibitors, has become a common and effective treatment for erectile dysfunction and since its formal approval for medical use in the public in 1998 [A175732], continues to see millions of prescriptions written for it internationally. Although the medication has historically been most popularly recognized as Pfizer''s brand name Viagra, sildenafil is currently available generically and even as a non-prescription over the counter medication in some countries [L5656].','["G01AE10", "G04BE03"]','[]'),(7020,'Solovit zinc glycinate 20mg 30 hgc','سولوفيت زنك جليسينات 20مجم 30 كبسولة','119','','Multivitamin','Zinc glycinate 20mg','Solovit for dietary supplement','Sol','محلول','20mg','3','','','','',829,'2025-08-17',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(7021,'Invabragin 7.5mg 20 tabs','انفابراجين 7.5مجم 20 قرص','124','','','','Company','Tab','أقراص','7.5mg','2','','','','',868,'2024-05-16',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(7023,'Labipress 5 mg/ml i.v. inf./bolus vial','لابيبريس 5مجم/مل فيال وريدي','42','','Anti-hypertensive.beta blocker.unselective','Labetalol','Debeiky > novell pharma','Vial','فيال','5 mg','1','','about labetalol a mixed alpha/beta adrenergic antagonist antihypertensive(pregnancy-induced hypertension). mechanism of action of labetalol labetalol is an adrenergic antagonist capable of blocking alpha-1 beta-1 and beta-2 receptors and additional weak b','','',1260,'2022-08-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Labetalol is a racemic mixture of 2 diastereoisomers where dilevalol, the R,R'' stereoisomer, makes up 25% of the mixture.[L7730] Labetalol is formulated as an injection or tablets to treat hypertension.[L7727,L7730]
