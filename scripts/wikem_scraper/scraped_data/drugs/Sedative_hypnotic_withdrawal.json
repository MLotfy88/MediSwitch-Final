    "Background": {
      "text": "Sedative/hypnotics, including benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and non-benzodiazepine \"Z-drugs\" (e.g., zolpidem, eszopiclone), are commonly prescribed for anxiety, insomnia, and seizure disorders. While effective in the short term, these agents carry a significant risk for tolerance, physical dependence, and withdrawal upon abrupt discontinuation. The underlying pathophysiology of withdrawal stems from chronic modulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, resulting in a state of central nervous system hyperexcitability when the inhibitory effect is suddenly removed\n[1]\n. Sedative/hypnotic withdrawal remains underrecognized in clinical practice despite its potentially life-threatening complications, such as seizures and delirium\n[2]\n.",

    "Clinical_Features": {
      "text": "For short-acting agents like alprazolam or zolpidem, withdrawal can begin within 6–24 hours after the last dose. Long-acting agents like diazepam may produce symptoms after several days.\nCommon features include:\nMild: anxiety, insomnia, restlessness, tremors, diaphoresis\nModerate: palpitations, nausea, myoclonus, perceptual disturbances\nSevere: hallucinations, psychosis, seizures, and delirium tremens-like presentations\nSymptoms typically peak within 48–72 hours but can persist for weeks, especially with long-term use.\n[3]\nA clinical feature distinguishing sedative/hypnotic withdrawal from alcohol withdrawal is the potential for prolonged symptoms due to the long half-life of some agents.",
