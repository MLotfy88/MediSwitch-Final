According to the product labeling, multiple CYP450 isoenzymes (CYP450 3A4, 2B6, and 2D6) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases contribute to osilodrostat metabolism, and no single pathway contributes greater than 25% to the total clearance. Some of the known CYP450 3A4 and 2B6 inducers also induce UDP-glucuronosyltransferases.', 'DDInter', 'The potential for diminished pharmacologic effects of osilodrostat should be considered during concomitant use of a CYP450 3A4 and/or 2B6 inducer. An increase in the dosage of osilodrostat may be required. Dosage adjustments should be based on clinical response and tolerance. Patients should have regular monitoring of 24-hour urine free cortisol and serum or plasma cortisol during treatment, as well as regular evaluations of their signs and symptoms.
