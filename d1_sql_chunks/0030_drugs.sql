It belongs to the sulfonylurea class of insulin secretagogues, which act by stimulating β cells of the pancreas to release insulin. Sulfonylureas increase both basal insulin secretion and meal-stimulated insulin release. Medications in this class differ in their dose, rate of absorption, duration of action, route of elimination and binding site on their target pancreatic β cell receptor. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, though less so than insulin. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased in elderly, debilitated and malnourished individuals. Chlorpropamide is not recommended for the treatment of NIDDM as it increases blood pressure and the risk of retinopathy (UKPDS-33). Up to 80% of the single oral dose of chlorpropramide is metabolized, likely in the liver; 80-90% of the dose is excreted in urine as unchanged drug and metabolites.

As the binding of pantoprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, pantoprazole''s duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as pantoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]

PPIs such as pantoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]

Pantoprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing as rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as pantoprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion.[A177574]','["A02BD04", "A02BD11", "A02BC02"]','[]'),(24540,'Pantomerican 40 mg 14 f.c. tabs.','بانتوميريكان 40مجم 14 قرص','98','68','Peptic ulcer.proton pump inhibitor','Pantoprazole','Sigma > paxal pharmaceutical','Tab','أقراص','40 mg','2','علاج التهاب المريء التآكلي (تلف المريء من حمض المعدة الناجم عن مرض الارتجاع المعدي المريئي ، أو ارتجاع المريء) عند البالغين','about pantoprazole a proton pump inhibitor benzimidazole derivative anti ulcer. mechanism of action of pantoprazole pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor. it is a prodrug. after administration it diffuses in to the parietal cell of the stomach and accum','6225000356986','',3147,'2024-12-04',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Pantoprazole is a first-generation proton pump inhibitor (PPI) used for the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), for gastric protection to prevent recurrence of stomach ulcers or gastric damage from chronic use of NSAIDs, and for the treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions including Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) Syndrome.

It is reported that ribavirin might be only effective in early stages of viral hemorrhagic fevers including Lasser fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever, and Hantavirus infection. Ribavirin is a prodrug that is metabolized into nucleoside analogs that blocks viral RNA synthesis and viral mRNA capping. Before the development of newer drugs, ribavirin and [DB00008]/[DB00022] dual therapy was considered the first-generation and standard antiviral treatment [A19626]. The dual therapy was administered for 48 weeks in patients with genotype 1, 4, 5, and 6, and 24 weeks in patients with genotype 2 and 3 [A19626]. Newer drugs developed as Hepatitis C viral infection treatments can be used to reduce or eliminate the use of ribavirin, which are associated with serious adverse effects. They also improve therapeutic efficacy in patients with failed [DB00008]/[DB00022] and ribavirin-based therapy. The potential use of ribavirin as a treatment for acute myeloid leukemia is currently under investigation.

According to 2017 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and 2015 consensus guidelines from the Canadian Association for the Study of the Liver (CASL), ribavirin is typically used as an adjunct therapy to various first-line and second-line combination therapies recommended for each genotypes. Ribavirin is added to decrease relapse rates by accelerating viral clearance early in the treatment course [A19645]. When used to treat Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, it is always used as a part of combination therapies as ribavirin monotherapy is not efficacious in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection [A19644]. Additionally, including ribavirin in the regimen can increase the risk of anemia. 

In HCV genotye 1/2/3/4/5/6 patients, ribavirin can be used in combination therapy involving [DB09102] and [DB08934], Eplusa ([DB08934], [DB11613]), Harvoni ([DB08934], [DB09027]), [DB06290] and [DB08934], Viekira Pak ([DB09296], [DB09297], [DB00503], [DB09183]), Technivie ([DB00503], [DB09296], [DB09297]) and Zepatier ([DB11574], [DB11575]).

More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Rosuvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [simvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] This is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than [atorvastatin]''s effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial[A181427] concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.

Rosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]','["C10BX10", "C10BX05", "C10BX07", "C10AA07", "A10BH52", "G01AE10", "C10BX13", "C10BX09", "C10BA09", "C10BX16", "C10BX17", "C10BX14", "C10BA06"]','[]'),(24691,'Pentastatin 5 mg 20 f.c. tabs.','بنتاستاتين 5مجم 20 قرص','59','34','Antihyperlipidemic.statins','Rosuvastatin','Penta pharma-egypt','Tab','أقراص','5 mg','2','','about rosuvastatin statin hmg-coa reductase inhibitor antilipemic. mechanism of action of rosuvastatin it is a hypolipidaemic statin which competitively inhibits the conversion of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme a (hmg coa) to mevalonate. the drug ex','','',1298,'2024-07-21',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Rosuvastatin, also known as the brand name product Crestor, is a lipid-lowering drug that belongs to the statin class of medications, which are used to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and manage elevated lipid levels by inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver.

Rosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]','["C10BX10", "C10BX05", "C10BX07", "C10AA07", "A10BH52", "G01AE10", "C10BX13", "C10BX09", "C10BA09", "C10BX16", "C10BX17", "C10BX14", "C10BA06"]','[]'),(24693,'Pentaviton 30 f.c. tab.','بنتافيتون 30 قرص','27','','Multivitamins','Folic acid+vitamin b1+vitamin b2+vitamin b6+vitamin b12','International drug agency (idi) > novell pharma','Tab','أقراص','','3','مكمل غذائى لعلاج الانيميا ودعم الجهاز العصبى وامداد الجسم بالطاقة','','6223004070525','',1746,'2022-12-26',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(24694,'Pentaxim vaccine 0.5ml','بينتاكسيم فاكسين لقاح 0.5مل','126','','Vaccine','Diphtheria+haemophilus influenza b+pertussis+poliomyelitis+tetanus toxoid','Sanofi pasteur-france > etimex-egypt','Pen','قلم','0.5ml','1','','','','',1142,'2022-07-14',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(24695,'Pentolate 1% eye drops 10 ml','بنتولات قطرة عين 10 مل','8','','Mydriatic','Cyclopentolate','Amoun','Pen','قلم','1%','1','','about cyclopentolate ophthalmic anticholinergic(anti-muscarinic) a mydriatic and cycloplegic agent for diagnostic purposes. mechanism of action of cyclopentolate cyclopentolate is a muscarinic receptor blocker. it nonselectively inhibits the muscarinic ac','6221025017000','',1043,'2023-04-18',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'None','[]','[]'),(24696,'Pentolegic 1% eye drops 30*0.5 ml sdu','بنتولجيك قطرة عين 30 عبوة','54','','Mydriatic','Cyclopentolate','Orchidia pharmaceutical industries','Pen','قلم','1%','1','معقم للعين -- موسع لحدقة العين قبل العمليات الجراحية والفحص','about cyclopentolate ophthalmic anticholinergic(anti-muscarinic) a mydriatic and cycloplegic agent for diagnostic purposes. mechanism of action of cyclopentolate cyclopentolate is a muscarinic receptor blocker. it nonselectively inhibits the muscarinic ac','6223005441164','',2088,'2022-05-15',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'None','[]','[]'),(24697,'Pentotitis 100 mg 30 h.g. caps.','بينتوتيتيس 100مجم 30 كبسولة','66','','Anti-inflammatory','Pentosan polysulphate','Andalous pharma','Cap','كبسولة','100 mg','3','مضاد للالتهاب','','','',968,'2022-05-27',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(24699,'Pentox 600mg sr 10 f.c.tab','بنتوكس 600مجم اس آر 10 اقراص','10','','Anti-ischemic','Pentoxifylline','Hikma pharma > atos pharma','Tab','أقراص','600mg','1','','','','',1017,'2022-06-15',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Pentoxifylline (PTX) is a synthetic dimethylxanthine derivative that modulates the rheological properties of blood and also has both anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.[A226415, L30300] Although originally developed to treat intermittent claudication, a form of exertion-induced leg pain common in patients with peripheral arterial disease, PTX has been investigated for its possible use in diverse conditions, including osteoradionecrosis, diabetic kidney disease, and generally any condition associated with fibrosis.[A226410, A226415, A226455] More recently, PTX has been suggested as a possible treatment for COVID-19-induced pulmonary complications due to its ability to regulate the production of inflammatory cytokines.[A226608]

Pantoprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cell. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of pantoprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, pantoprazole''s duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as pantoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]

PPIs such as pantoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]

Pantoprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing as rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as pantoprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion.[A177574]','["A02BD04", "A02BD11", "A02BC02"]','[]'),(24721,'Peptoloc 40mg 7 tab.','بيبتولوك 40مجم 7 اقراص','21','','Peptic ulcer.proton pump inhibitor','Pantoprazole','Kahira > multipharma','Tab','أقراص','40mg','1','','about pantoprazole a proton pump inhibitor benzimidazole derivative anti ulcer. mechanism of action of pantoprazole pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor. it is a prodrug. after administration it diffuses in to the parietal cell of the stomach and accum','','',1449,'2022-07-17',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Pantoprazole is a first-generation proton pump inhibitor (PPI) used for the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), for gastric protection to prevent recurrence of stomach ulcers or gastric damage from chronic use of NSAIDs, and for the treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions including Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) Syndrome.

Long term use of PPIs such as pantoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]

PPIs such as pantoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]

Pantoprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing as rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as pantoprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion.[A177574]','["A02BD04", "A02BD11", "A02BC02"]','[]'),(24722,'Nymphacora 20 tablets','نيمفاكورا 20 قرص','120','95','Calcium supplement','Calcium carbonate+magnesium+vitd3+zinc+boron+copper+manganese+selenium','Doctors pharma','Tablet','أقراص','','2','','','','',1099,'2025-08-23',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(24724,'Pepzol 40mg 14 caps','بيبزول 40مجم 14 كبسولة','81','75','Peptic ulcer.proton pump inhibitor','Omeprazole','Hikma pharma','Cap','كبسولة','40mg','1','','','6221000001017','',3561,'2024-08-20',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Originally approved by the FDA in 1989, omeprazole is a _proton-pump inhibitor_, used to treat gastric acid-related disorders.

Haloperidol is indicated for the treatment of the manifestations of several psychotic disorders including schizophrenia, acute psychosis, Tourette syndrome, and other severe behavioural states.[F4645] It is also used off-label for the management of chorea associated with Huntington''s disease and for the treatment of intractable hiccups as it is a potent antiemetic. Dopamine-antagonizing medications such as haloperidol are though to improve psychotic symptoms and states that are caused by an over-production of dopamine, such as schizophrenia, which is theorized to be caused by a hyperdopaminergic state within the limbic system of the brain.[A34360]

Use of the first-generation antipsychotics (including haloperidol) is considered highly effective for the management of the "positive" symptoms of schizophrenia including hallucinations, hearing voices, aggression/hostility, disorganized speech, and psychomotor agitation. However, this class of drugs is also limited by the development of movement disorders induced by dopamine-blockade such as drug-induced parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, tardive dyskinesia, as well as other side effects including sedation, weight gain, and prolactin changes. While there are limited high-quality studies comparing haloperidol to lower-potency first-generation antipsychotics such as [DB00477], [DB01624], [DB00623], and [DB01403], haloperidol typically demonstrates the least amount of side effects within this class, but demonstrates a stronger disposition for causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).[A180613, A180616, A180625] These other low‐potency antipsychotics are limited by their lower affinity for dopamine receptors, which requires a higher dose to effectively treat symptoms of schizophrenia. In addition, they block many receptors other than the primary target (dopamine receptors), such as cholinergic or histaminergic receptors, resulting in a higher incidence of side effects such as sedation, weight gain, and hypotension.

Interestingly, in vivo pharmacogenetic studies have demonstrated that the metabolism of haloperidol may be modulated by genetically determined polymorphic _CYP2D6_ activity. However, these findings contradict the findings from studies in vitro with human liver microsomes and from drug interaction studies in vivo. Inter-ethnic and pharmacogenetic differences in haloperidol metabolism may possibly explain these observations.[A32346]

First-generation antipsychotic drugs have largely been replaced with second- and third-generation (atypical) antipsychotics such as [DB00734], [DB00334], [DB00363], [DB01224], [DB01238], and [DB00246]. However, haloperidol use remains widespread and is considered the benchmark for comparison in trials of the newer generation antipsychotics.[A180625]

It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infections along with other antibiotics including [amoxicillin], [clarithromycin], and [metronidazole], for example.[A177271][F4498] Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [omeprazole], [esomeprazole], [lansoprazole], [dexlansoprazole], and [rabeprazole].

Pantoprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cell. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of pantoprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, pantoprazole''s duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as pantoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]

PPIs such as pantoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]

Pantoprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing as rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as pantoprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion.[A177574]','["A02BD04", "A02BD11", "A02BC02"]','[]');

The result of doing so allows cGMP present in both the penis and pulmonary vasculature to elicit smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation that subsequently facilitates relief in pulmonary arterial hypertension and the increased flow of blood into the spongy erectile tissue of the penis that consequently allows it to grow in size and become erect and rigid [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

Interestingly enough, it is precisely via this mechanism why sildenafil was at first researched as a potential treatment for angina - or chest pain associated with inadequate blood flow to the heart - before being serendipitously indicated for treating erectile dysfunction in the late 1980s [A175732]. Nevertheless, it is because of this mechanism that sildenafil is also indicated for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension but is also additionally notorious for interacting with various anti-anginal or anti-hypertensive agents to develop potentially rapid, excessive, and/or fatal hypotensive crises [A175579, A175582, A175654].

Regardless, sildenafil, among a variety of other similar or related PDE5 inhibitors, has become a common and effective treatment for erectile dysfunction and since its formal approval for medical use in the public in 1998 [A175732], continues to see millions of prescriptions written for it internationally. Although the medication has historically been most popularly recognized as Pfizer''s brand name Viagra, sildenafil is currently available generically and even as a non-prescription over the counter medication in some countries [L5656].','["G01AE10", "G04BE03"]','[]'),(24913,'Physiogel a.i. cream 50ml','فسيوجل كريم 50مل','72','','Skin care','Aqua+olea europaea+glycerin+pentylene glycol+palm glycerides+olus+hydrogenated lecithin+squalene+bet','Glaxo smithkline > modern office for import','Cream','كريم','50ml','1','','*relieves redness and irritation - restores the cutaneous barrier - for dry and sensitive skin *fragrance free - preservative free','6001076228255','',947,'2022-12-08',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(24914,'Physiomer baby mist nasal spray 115ml','فيزيومير بخاخ رضع 115 مل','400','290','Nasal decongestant','Natural undiluted and isotonic seawater','Laboratoire de la mer > star international company','Spray','بخاخ','115ml','1','بخاخ للانف في حالات المخاط --يساعد علي تحسين التنفس -- يساعد علي التخلص من المخاط --','*clears your toddler s nasal passages and helps restore breathing as well as comfort and wellbeing during sleeping and feeding. *in daily use: it cleanses humidifies and eliminates excess mucus - clears dust allergens pollutants and pathogens (viruses and','3564300031234','',5650,'2024-02-20',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(24915,'Physiomer baby mist unidoses 30 doses of 5ml','فيزيومير بيبي ميست يونيدوز 30 عبوة 5 مل','320','225','Nasal care','Natural undiluted and isotonic seawater','Laboratoire de la mer > star international company','Unknown','غير محدد','5ml','30','','*clears your toddler s nasal passages and helps restore breathing as well as comfort and wellbeing during sleeping and feeding. *in daily use: it cleanses humidifies and eliminates excess mucus - clears dust allergens pollutants and pathogens (viruses and','3564300001008','',1351,'2024-02-20',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(24916,'Physiomer eucalyptus nasal spray 135ml','فيزيومير اوكاليبتوس بخاخ للانف 135 مل','225','170','Nasal decongestant','Natural seawater+hypertonic concentration of mineral salts+essential oil of eucalyptus globulus+natu','Laboratoire de la mer > star international company','Spray','بخاخ','135ml','1','','','3564300001046','',1218,'2024-02-10',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(24917,'Physiomer hypertonic nasal spray 135ml','فيزيومير هيبرتونيك سبراي للانف 135 مل','350','250','Nasal decongestant','Natural undiluted seawater+hypertonic concentration of mineral salts','Laboratoire de la mer > star international company','Spray','بخاخ','135ml','1','علاج احتقان الانف -- تحسين التنفس -- علاج التهابات الانف و الرشح والزكام','*relieves nasal congestion due to cold rhinosinusitis or allergic rhinitis. *nasal decongestant which is suitable for prolonged use and safe during pregnancy while breastfeeding.','3564300001039','',3434,'2024-02-20',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(24918,'Physiomer hypertonic nasal spray 20ml','فيزيومير هايبرتونيك بخاخ للانف 20 مل','170','165','Nasal decongestant','Natural undiluted seawater+hypertonic concentration of mineral salts','Laboratoire de la mer > star international company','Spray','بخاخ','20ml','1','','*relieves nasal congestion due to cold rhinosinusitis or allergic rhinitis. *nasal decongestant which is suitable for prolonged use and safe during pregnancy while breastfeeding.','3564300001022','',1192,'2023-12-10',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(24919,'Physiomer nasal aspirator','فيزيومير استنشاق للانف اسبيريتور','300','225','Nasal decongestant','','Laboratoire de la mer > star international company','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','3564300000025','',1071,'2024-02-20',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(24920,'Physiomer normal jet nasal spray 135ml','فيزيومير نورمال جيت بخاخ للانف 135 مل','350','300','Nasal decongestant','Natural undiluted and isotonic seawater','Laboratoire de la mer > star international company','Spray','بخاخ','135ml','1','','*for adults and children age 6 + *in case of stuffy nose it clears the upper respiratory tract and helps restore nasal breathing comfort and wellbeing. *in case of fluid or abundant secretions due to a cold or any other nasal infection: cleanses moistens','3564300031258','',1901,'2025-10-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(24921,'Physiomer strong jet nasal spray 210ml','فيزيومير سترونج جيت بخاخ للانف 210 مل','350','250','Nasal decongestant','Natural undiluted and isotonic seawater','Laboratoire de la mer > star international company','Spray','بخاخ','210ml','1','','*for adults and children age 10 + *it provides relief for adults suffering from significant respiratory discomfort due to chronic or infectious rhinosinusal pathologies. *in cases of scabs or thick sticky purulent nasal discgarge: abundantly irrigates dee','3564300001015','',2954,'2024-02-20',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL);
