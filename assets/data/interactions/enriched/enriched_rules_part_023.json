There have been isolated reports of QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias occurring in patients treated with SMX-TMP intravenously. Patients should be advised to seek prompt medical attention if they experience symptoms that could indicate the occurrence of torsade de pointes such as dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, palpitation, irregular heart rhythm, shortness of breath, or syncope.",

Conversely, anticholinergic agents may negate the already small pharmacologic benefits of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in the treatment of dementia.

For patients requiring treatment to counteract adverse effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor therapy (e.g., gastrointestinal intolerance, urinary problems), an agent without anticholinergic properties should be used whenever possible. Otherwise, a dosage reduction, slower titration, or even discontinuation of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor should be considered. For patients who are already receiving an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor with anticholinergic agents, every attempt should be made to discontinue the latter or substitute them with less anticholinergic alternatives. Caution is required, however, since anticholinergic withdrawal may occur.

      "effect": "The antidiuretic response to vasopressin or desmopressin may be potentiated by certain drugs, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic/tetracyclic antidepressants, carbamazepine, chlorpropamide, chlorpromazine, clofibrate, eslicarbazepine, fludrocortisone, haloperidol, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, urea, and some antineoplastic agents (e.g., vinca alkaloids, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide). These drugs can occasionally cause fluid retention, in some cases secondary to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Coadministration with vasopressin or desmopressin may, therefore, increase the risk of water intoxication and/or hyponatremia. Seizure and coma in association with severe hyponatremia have been reported during concomitant use of desmopressin and imipramine or ibuprofen.",
      "management_text": "Caution is advised when vasopressin or desmopressin is used in combination with drugs that can cause fluid retention or SIADH. Some authorities recommend adjusting vasopressin dosage as needed. Serum electrolytes, especially sodium, as well as BUN and creatinine should be monitored regularly. Patients should be advised to seek medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms of water intoxication or hyponatremia such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, headache, malaise, lethargy, irritability, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, muscle spasm, unsteadiness (which may lead to falls), anuria, and weight gain. Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated; therefore, early treatment is important to help prevent progression to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, and death.",

Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can decrease serum bicarbonate in a dose-related manner and induce non-anion gap, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. In addition, they can promote stone formation by reducing urinary citrate excretion and increasing urinary pH. Because they alter electrolyte and fluid balance, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may also predispose patients to heat-related disorders. Oligohidrosis and hyperthermia have specifically been reported with the use of topiramate or zonisamide, particularly in pediatric patients, and coadministration with other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may potentiate the risk according to the manufacturers.

If metabolic acidosis develops and persists, consideration should be given to reducing the dosage or discontinuing treatment. Manifestations of acute or chronic metabolic acidosis may include hyperventilation, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and anorexia, or more severe sequelae like cardiac arrhythmias or stupor. If left untreated, metabolic acidosis can also lead to nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis, osteomalacia (or rickets in children), osteoporosis, and reduced growth rates in pediatric patients. Increased fluid intake is recommended during therapy with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors to increase urinary output, which lowers the concentration of substances involved in stone formation. Patients, particularly pediatric patients, should be monitored closely for evidence of decreased sweating and increased body temperature, especially in warm or hot weather. Proper hydration before and during vigorous activities or exposure to warm temperatures is recommended. Patients (or their guardians or caregivers) should contact their doctor immediately if they develop signs or symptoms of kidney stones such as sudden back pain, abdominal pain and/or blood in the urine, of if they are not sweating as usual, with or without a fever. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors should be used cautiously in the presence of predisposing factors to acidosis, such as renal impairment, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, prolonged or severe diarrhea, a ketogenic diet (i.e., high protein/low carbohydrate), or surgery.",

Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can decrease serum bicarbonate in a dose-related manner and induce non-anion gap, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. In addition, they can promote stone formation by reducing urinary citrate excretion and increasing urinary pH. Because they alter electrolyte and fluid balance, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may also predispose patients to heat-related disorders. Oligohidrosis and hyperthermia have specifically been reported with the use of topiramate or zonisamide, particularly in pediatric patients, and coadministration with other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may potentiate the risk according to the manufacturers. Oligohidrosis and hyperthermia are sometimes associated with serious sequelae, but may be preventable by prompt recognition of symptoms and appropriate treatment.",
      "management_text": "The use of more than one carbonic anhydrase inhibitor at a time is generally not recommended. Patients receiving treatment with a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor should have baseline and periodic measurements of serum bicarbonate. If metabolic acidosis develops and persists, consideration should be given to reducing the dosage or discontinuing treatment. Manifestations of acute or chronic metabolic acidosis may include hyperventilation, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and anorexia, or more severe sequelae like cardiac arrhythmias or stupor. If left untreated, metabolic acidosis can also lead to nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis, osteomalacia (or rickets in children), osteoporosis, and reduced growth rates in pediatric patients. Increased fluid intake is recommended during therapy with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors to increase urinary output, which lowers the concentration of substances involved in stone formation. Patients, particularly pediatric patients, should be monitored closely for evidence of decreased sweating and increased body temperature, especially in warm or hot weather. Proper hydration before and during vigorous activities or exposure to warm temperatures is recommended. Patients (or their guardians or caregivers) should contact their doctor immediately if they develop signs or symptoms of kidney stones such as sudden back pain, abdominal pain and/or blood in the urine, of if they are not sweating as usual, with or without a fever. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors should be used cautiously in the presence of predisposing factors to acidosis, such as renal impairment, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, prolonged or severe diarrhea, a ketogenic diet (i.e., high protein/low carbohydrate), or surgery.",
