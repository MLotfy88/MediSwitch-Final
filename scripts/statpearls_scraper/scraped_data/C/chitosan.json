    "indications": "Indications for treatment include traumatic hemorrhage from any of the following locations:\n\nGroin\nAxilla\nBase of neck\nPerineum\nShoulder girdle",
    "clinical_significance": "Traumatic hemorrhage is the leading cause of preventable military death and the 2nd leading cause of death in civilian trauma patients.\n[5]\nA study evaluating U.S. combat casualties from 2001 to 2011 found that 19.2% of preventable prehospital deaths resulted from junctional hemorrhage.\n[7]\n\nMassive hemorrhage is a time-dependent condition. Treatment options for ongoing hemorrhage in the prehospital setting have historically been limited. Hemostatic transfusion algorithms aid in emergency department resuscitation but are less useful in the prehospital environment, where access to blood products is rare. Prehospital interventions must focus on quickly finding and stopping the bleeding to facilitate rapid transport to definitive care.\n\nThe rising incidence of civilian mass shootings and bombings makes military medicine innovations increasingly relevant in the civilian sector. Advances in prehospital hemorrhage control may allow more time for definitive surgical management and yield a significant survival advantage. As discussed above, recognizing the possible consequences of massive junctional hemorrhage has led to numerous innovations in prehospital junctional hemorrhage control. Besides skillfully administering state-of-the-art medical and surgical interventions, EMS providers must be competent in managing hemorrhage."
