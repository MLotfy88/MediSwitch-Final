Some supportive data are available for medroxyprogesterone.  Specifically, medroxyprogesterone treatment may be associated with breast cancer, primarily when the drug is administered intramuscularly.  A pooled analysis of two case-control studies, one from the World Health Organization and the other from New Zealand, revealed a small overall relative risk of breast cancer in women who have ever used intramuscular medroxyprogesterone acetate.  The relative risk was higher in the subgroup of women who had initiated therapy within the previous 5 years.  Thus, an increased risk (approximately 2-fold) is associated with intramuscular medroxyprogesterone use in the first 5 years.

Imipramine appears to have the greatest propensity to induce these effects, while secondary amines such as nortriptyline may do so less frequently.  Tolerance to the hypotensive effects often develops after a few doses to a few weeks.  Rarely, collapse and sudden death have occurred secondary to severe hypotension.  Other reported adverse cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmias, heart block, hypertension, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, myocardial infarction, strokes, congestive heart failure, and ECG abnormalities such as PR and QT interval prolongation.  Therapy with TCAs should be avoided during the acute recovery phase following myocardial infarction, and should be administered only with extreme caution in patients with hyperthyroidism, a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or a predisposition to hypotension.
