    "indications": "Pancytopenia is a hematologic condition characterized by a decrease in all three peripheral blood cell lines. It is characterized by a hemoglobin value of less than 12 g/dL in women and 13 g/dL in men, platelets of less than 150,000 per mcL, and leukocytes of less than 4000 per ml (or absolute neutrophil count of less than 1800 per ml).\n[1]\n[2]\nHowever, these thresholds mainly depend on age, sex, race, and varying clinical scenarios.\n\nLeukopenia is primarily seen as neutropenia since neutrophils constitute the majority of leukocytes. Pancytopenia is not a disease but a manifestation of other underlying conditions.\n[3]\nIt is commonly associated with multiple benign and malignant conditions.\n[1]\nPancytopenia could be a result of decreased production of the cells or increased destruction. Anyone presenting with pancytopenia requires a thorough evaluation to identify the underlying etiology.",
    "mechanism": "The etiology of pancytopenia can be broadly categorized as a central type that involves production disorders or a peripheral type that involves disorders of increased destruction.\n[4]\nThese causes could contribute to pancytopenia independently or as a combination.\n\nDecreased production (central type):\nPancytopenia due to decreased production is mainly secondary to nutritional deficiencies. Pancytopenia caused by bone marrow failure is known as aplastic anemia. Aplastic anemia could be idiopathic/autoimmune, secondary to infections (such as parvovirus B19, hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cytomegalovirus, or Epstein-Barr virus), after drug toxicity, or chemotherapeutic agents (methotrexate, dapsone, carbimazole, carbamazepine, chloramphenicol). Pancytopenia can also be related to inadequate intake (as seen in eating disorders and alcoholics) or malabsorption.\n[5]\n\nBone marrow infiltration/replacement:\nThe production of cell lines is also impaired when the bone marrow is infiltrated by malignancies (lymphoma, leukemia, multiple myeloma) or granulomatous disorders. Metastatic tumors can also cause bone marrow replacement late in the disease, thus producing pancytopenia.\n\nIncreased destruction (peripheral type):\nPeripheral destruction of cells can be associated with many autoimmune conditions (such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis) and splenic sequestration (alcoholic liver cirrhosis, HIV, tuberculosis, malaria). Hypersplenism affects platelets and erythrocytes more than leukocytes.\n\nWith the current\nCovid-19 pandemic\n, pancytopenia has been reported secondary to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\nBone marrow aspiration had shown viral infection and infiltration with SARS-CoV-2.\n[9]\n\nDespite extensive workup, a subset of patients has unexplained cytopenia, classified as\nidiopathic cytopenias of unknown significance\n.\n[10]\n\nThe table below summarizes the causes of pancytopenia according to the mechanisms involved:\n\nTable\nAutoimmune disorders (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], rheumatoid arthritis [RA], sarcoidosis) Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)\n\nTable 1. Mechanisms of pancytopenia\n\nTable\nAspirin Salicylates\n\nTable 2. Drugs causing pancytopenia",
    "monitoring": "The initial workup includes a complete blood count, along with a reticulocyte count. This will help to determine if the pancytopenia is secondary to decreased production. The mean corpuscular volume would point towards megaloblastic anemia. A peripheral blood smear can show abnormal cells such as blasts, dysplastic leukocytes, and immature cells. These abnormal cells may be related to conditions described in table 3. The diagnosis related to abnormal cells may require further investigations:\n\nBone marrow aspirate and biopsy\nCytogenetic testing (fluorescent in situ hybridization [FISH] or karyotype) of bone marrow or peripheral blood\nFlow cytometry of bone marrow and/or peripheral blood\nMolecular studies (e.g., mutation analysis, gene expression profiling)\nThe workup should also include vitamin B12 and folate levels, liver chemistry, and lactate dehydrogenase.\n\nInfectious workup should be done as pancytopenia can be associated with infections such as HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis.\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n\nIn pancytopenia cases secondary to an acute viral infection, no further workup should be performed as most resolved rapidly. Follow-up laboratories can be performed to confirm the resolution of the pancytopenia. Similarly, in severe infections with sepsis, further workup should not be performed as pancytopenia is most likely the result of sepsis. The termination of the infection/sepsis will correct the pancytopenia.\n\nFurther evaluation for undiagnosed hepatitis and autoimmune conditions or malignancies should be pursued if suspected.\n[21]\nSerum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels can help patients with a negative workup, as there are cases of hyperparathyroidism causing pancytopenia.\n[22]\n[23]\nA thyroid profile should also be obtained, as hyperthyroidism is associated with pancytopenia.\n[24]\n[25]\n\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy can be done if no specific etiology is found to evaluate the status of the bone marrow stem cells. Bone marrow aspiration establishes the diagnosis of pancytopenia in 75% of cases.\n[13]\n[26]\nThe most common etiologies found are hypoplastic marrow, followed by megaloblastic anemia and hematological malignancies. Pathological examination of the bone marrow biopsy is helpful in malignant etiologies. It can show a clonal population of cells, primary/secondary malignant cells, acellular marrow, fibroblasts, granulomas from tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, or fungal infections.\n\nTable\n\nTable 3. Abnormal cells on blood smear with associated conditions",
    "administration": "Treatment is based on the underlying etiology of pancytopenia. Nutritional deficiencies should be corrected. Any offending drug should be discontinued. Treatment for infections such as HIV or tuberculosis should be started immediately. If an autoimmune condition or malignancy is diagnosed, it should be treated. Aplastic anemia secondary to viral infections such as parvovirus is transient and symptomatic treatment should suffice. Treatment options for patients with severe aplastic anemia could include a hematopoietic stem cell transplant and immunosuppression. Hematology referral should be sought for these patients.\n\nSupportive care for patients includes red blood cell transfusion for anemia to alleviate symptoms and perfuse vital structures. Platelet transfusion is indicated for thrombocytopenia of less than 10,000 per mcL to prevent spontaneous intracranial bleeding. Prompt initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is recommended for patients with neutropenic fever or severe neutropenia with an absolute neutrophil count of less than 500 per ml due to the risk of death from sepsis.",
    "adverse_effects": "Complications of pancytopenia include an increased risk of infections, life-threatening anemia, and bleeding. Patients presenting with fever will need broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungals with pan cultures. Supportive transfusions with packed red blood cells and platelets should be initiated promptly if severe anemia or thrombocytopenia with bleeding is present. Other complications include tumor lysis syndrome seen in patients receiving chemotherapy for substantial tumors like high-grade lymphoma and acute leukemia.\n[29]"
