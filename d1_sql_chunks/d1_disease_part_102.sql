Expert hematologic consultation should be available for all patients treated with felbamate.  Since aplastic anemia typically develops without premonitory clinical or laboratory signs, it should be borne in mind that routine blood testing may not be reliably used to prevent development of the syndrome.  However, in some cases, it may allow the detection of hematologic changes before the condition is full-blown.
