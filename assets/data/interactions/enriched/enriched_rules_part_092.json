Peripheral neuropathy is a common, potentially severe side effect of thalidomide that may be irreversible. Thalidomide can cause bradycardia and may potentiate the risk of torsade de pointes arrhythmia associated with the use of drugs that prolong the QT interval.",
      "management_text": "Caution is advised if thalidomide is used in combination with other neurotoxic agents. All patients treated with thalidomide should be examined at monthly intervals for the first three months of therapy and periodically thereafter to detect early signs of neuropathy such as burning, tingling, pain, or numbness in the hands and feet. Electrophysiological testing may be performed at baseline and every six months during therapy to detect asymptomatic neuropathy. Consideration should be given to immediate discontinuation of thalidomide in patients who develop peripheral neuropathy to limit further damage. Symptoms may improve or return to baseline in some patients upon discontinuation of thalidomide, although the complete time course of this toxicity has not been fully characterized. Because bradycardia is a risk factor for torsade de pointes arrhythmia, caution is advised when thalidomide is used with drugs that can prolong the QT interval or induce torsade de pointes arrhythmia. Patients should be monitored for bradycardia, atrioventricular block and syncope, and advised to seek medical attention if they experience dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, shortness of breath, or slow or irregular heartbeat. A dose reduction of thalidomide or discontinuation may be required.",

Since the development of peripheral neuropathy appears to be dose-related, the recommended dosage of zalcitabine should not be exceeded.
