      "text": "\"Focused assessment with sonography for trauma\"\nPrioritize: Do primary survey of ATLS first (\nABCDE\n)\nFAST exam follows ABCDE to assess “C” looking for free fluid\nSensitivity of 42% and specificity of ≥98%\n[1]\n[2]\nAs little as 100 mL of free fluid can be seen\n[3]\n[4]\n, though >500 mL is needed for the common user\n[5]\nIf blunt trauma start with RUQ view first\nIn penetrating start with cardiac views first to rule out tamponade\nSerial exams extremely helpful",
