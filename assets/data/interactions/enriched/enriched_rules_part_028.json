The proposed mechanisms include additive slowing in AV conduction, reduced cardiac contractility secondary to beta-blockade, and decreased peripheral vascular resistance secondary to calcium channel blockade. In addition, some calcium channel blockers may inhibit the CYP450 metabolism of hepatically metabolized beta blockers, resulting in increased serum concentrations.",

Symptoms of hypoglycemia such as tremor and tachycardia may be absent, making it more difficult for patients to recognize an oncoming episode.

Prolonged and severe hypoglycemia may occur, although these events have rarely been reported. Significant increases in blood pressure and bradycardia can also occur during hypoglycemia in diabetics treated with insulin and beta-blockers due to antagonism of epinephrine's effect on beta-2 adrenergic receptors, which leads to unopposed alpha-adrenergic effects including vasoconstriction. Other effects reported with various beta-blockers include decreased glucose tolerance and decreased glucose-induced insulin secretion.",
