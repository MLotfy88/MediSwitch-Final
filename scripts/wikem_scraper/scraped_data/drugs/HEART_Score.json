Patient's can be discharged with follow-up.\n4-6\n: 12-16.6% risk of adverse cardiac event. Patients should be admitted to the hospital for trending of\ntroponin\nand provocative testing.\n≥7\n: 50-65% risk of adverse cardiac event, suggesting early invasive measures with these patients and close coordination with inpatient cardiology\n",
