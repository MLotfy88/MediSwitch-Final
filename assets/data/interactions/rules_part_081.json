In healthy individuals, a thorough QT study did not show slowed ventricular conduction (widen QRS) with lamotrigine; however, the risk of slow ventricular conduction and proarrhythmias, including sudden death may be increased in patients with structural heart disease or myocardial ischemia.

A joint task force of the International League Against Epilepsy and the American Epilepsy Society issued an advisory on Feb 25, 2021, for healthcare professionals in response to the FDA safety warning on the cardiac effects of lamotrigine.  For patients under 60 years with no cardiac risk factors, they advise that clinicians should prescribe lamotrigine as usual.  For patients with cardiac risk (over 60 years and under 60 years with known cardiac disease or significant risk factors), they advise clinicians to consider obtaining an ECG prior to initiating lamotrigine and repeating ECG as the serum lamotrigine level approaches the upper limit of the therapeutic range and/or with concomitant use of other sodium channel blockers or substances known to impair atrioventricular and/or intra-ventricular cardiac conduction.  They also advise clinicians to consider obtaining an ECG and/or cardiology consult in patients with sudden onset syncope or pre-syncope with loss of muscular tone without a clear vasovagal or orthostatic cause.
