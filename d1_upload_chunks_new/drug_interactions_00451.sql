Theoretically, the concomitant administration of bivalirudin (plus aspirin) and platelet inhibitors may increase the risk of bleeding complications due to additive or synergistic effects on the clotting cascade. However, limited data from drug interaction studies do not suggest pharmacodynamic interactions with the platelet inhibitors, ticlopidine and abciximab.', 'DDInter', 'Until further data are available, the coadministration of bivalirudin and antiplatelet agents, and possibly other agents with antiplatelet activity such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), should probably be undertaken with caution. Close clinical and laboratory observation for bleeding complications is recommended.', 'Synergism', 'Until further data are available, the coadministration of bivalirudin and antiplatelet agents, and possibly other agents with antiplatelet activity such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), should probably be undertaken with caution.', 'Moderate', 'pharmacodynamic', NULL, 'https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/45270/', '', 'Protein C, Acenocoumarol, Selexipag', 'Fludrocortisone, Fluocinolone acetonide, Hydrocortisone, Prednisolone, Betamethasone, Fluorometholone, Methylprednisolone, Dexamethasone, Rabeprazole, Misoprostol, Chondroitin sulfate, More', 1767369485);
