For the treatment of erectile dysfunction, an initial sildenafil dosage of 25 mg should be considered in patients treated concomitantly with potent CYP450 3A4 inhibitors. Patients should be advised to promptly notify their physician if they experience pain or tightness in the chest or jaw, irregular heartbeat, nausea, shortness of breath, visual disturbances, syncope, or prolonged erection (greater than 4 hours). For the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, a dosage adjustment for sildenafil should be considered during coadministration with some CYP450 3A4 inhibitors such as erythromycin, saquinavir, clarithromycin, telithromycin, and nefazodone. However, use with very potent CYP450 3A4 inhibitors such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, or itraconazole is not recommended.
