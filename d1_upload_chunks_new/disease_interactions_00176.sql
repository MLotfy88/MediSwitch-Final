Potassium is irritating to the GI mucosa and may cause ulcerative and/or stenotic lesions during prolonged physical contact.  Based on spontaneous adverse reaction reports, the frequency of small bowel lesions associated with enteric-coated preparations of potassium chloride is 40 to 50 per 100,000 patient-years, while that for wax matrix controlled-release formulations is less than one per 100,000 patient years.  Esophageal ulceration has also been reported following administration of controlled-release formulations of potassium chloride in cardiac patients with esophageal compression due to enlarged left atrium.  Potassium supplementation should be administered as a liquid preparation or as an aqueous suspension in patients with esophageal obstruction and/or delayed gastrointestinal transit time.
Because of ulcerogenic effects, oral potassium should be administered cautiously in patients with peptic ulcers or other upper gastrointestinal diseases associated with inflammation, bleeding, or perforation.  Patients should be advised not to crush, chew, or break potassium tablets or capsules, and to take them with meals and a full glass of water or other liquid.  Potassium liquids should be diluted prior to consumption.', '3', '', 'DDInter', 0);
