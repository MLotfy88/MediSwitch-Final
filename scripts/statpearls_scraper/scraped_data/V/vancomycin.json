    "indications": "Antimicrobial resistance is becoming an increasingly common clinical dilemma for medical providers. In particular, vancomycin-resistant\nEnterococcus\n(VRE) has become a challenge to manage in the hospital setting. Enterococci are facultative anaerobic gram-positive cocci in pairs/chains that live in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and ordinarily function commensally with humans. However, they can cause a variety of infections, most commonly urinary tract infection (UTI), intraabdominal infection, bacteremia, or endocarditis. Rarely, they can cause meningitis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, or pneumonia. Additionally, vancomycin-resistant\nEnterococcus\noften exists as a colonizing organism that does not always contribute to infection, making it more difficult to determine when and how to treat these infections. Despite these difficulties, infection of vancomycin-resistant\nEnterococcus\nhas been shown to increase both cost and mortality when compared to vancomycin-susceptible isolates. With increasing rates of vancomycin resistance among\nEnterococcus\nisolates, good stewardship combined with aggressive treatment with targeted antibiotics is necessary to treat this frequently encountered infection.\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]",
    "mechanism": "Enterococci have developed a variety of mechanisms of resistance to several antibiotics like aminoglycosides,\nB\n-lactams, tetracyclines, quinolones, and vancomycin (glycopeptide). Intrinsically, they have penicillin-binding proteins with low-affinity to beta-lactams, can produce beta-lactamases, and have decreased cellular permeability to several. Specifically, vancomycin-resistant\nEnterococcus\nresistance is due to the changes in the formation of peptidoglycan that makes up the bacterial cell wall. Normally, vancomycin binds to the D-Ala-D-Ala terminus of the protein precursors to peptidoglycan. Resistance develops as this terminus is changed to D-Ala-D-lactate so that vancomycin binds with less affinity. This is coded by genotypes identified alphabetically as\nVanA\nto\nVanG\n. Of these, the plasmid-based\nVanA\nand\nVanB\ngenotypes are by far the most common, followed distantly in prevalence by the chromosomal phenotypes\nVanD\nand\nVanC\nrespectively. VRE has slightly different resistance formation with Aminoglycosides, all except for Streptomycin, the formation of resistance is mainly due to inactivating enzyme 2\"-phosphotransferase-6′-acetyltransferase. Streptomycin resistance on the other is through the production of streptomycin adenyltransferase.\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]",
    "monitoring": "Workup for vancomycin-resistant\nEnterococcus\nwill begin with the determination that the patient has an underlying infectious disease process. Next, each potential source of infection needs to be evaluated. Specimens from the potential source should be sent for routine cultures before administration of empiric antibiotics to determine the exact species and drug susceptibilities. Sensitivities for fosfomycin, daptomycin, nitrofurantoin, and chloramphenicol are not standard in all laboratories and should be added as clinically appropriate.\n[10]\n[11]",
    "administration": "Antibiotic therapy for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant\nEnterococcus\ndepends on the type of infection and drug susceptibility of the organism or organisms involved. In monomicrobial infections, the antibiotic choice should be tailored to tissue for penetration, culture, and local resistance patterns. Moreover, treatment can be controversial as vancomycin-resistant\nEnterococcus\noften can be found as a colonizer in polymicrobial infections. Initiation of vancomycin-resistant\nEnterococcus\ncoverage should be initiated based on clinical suspicion or failure of prior antibiotic regimens.\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n\nThe vast majority of enterococcal infections are due to\nE. faecalis\n.\nE. faecalis\ntends to be susceptible to beta-lactams and aminoglycosides. Vancomycin resistance is more frequent in undifferentiated\nE. faecalis\nthan resistance to aminopenicillins, stressing that beta-lactams should remain the first choice in most infections before culture data. Conversely, most strains of\nE. faecium\nare highly resistant to beta-lactams and aminoglycosides. In general, if vancomycin-resistant\nEnterococcus\nis highly resistant to other antimicrobial therapies; the two major treatments are linezolid and daptomycin. A meta-analysis of these two therapies has shown that the overall mortality, clinical cure, microbiological cure, and relapse rate were not significantly different. Importantly, the most common genotypic causes of vancomycin resistance are\nVanA\nand\nVanB\nwhich are inducible resistance genes. As a result, patients with initially vancomycin sensitive isolates that do not respond to treatment should be re-cultured.\n\nIf vancomycin-resistant\nEnterococcus\nis isolated and highly susceptible, therapy should be narrowed. For UTIs, monotherapy with high dose ampicillin, 18 to 30 g/day intravenous (IV), should be started. If the UTI is uncomplicated but resistant to ampicillin, then nitrofurantoin 100 mg per os (PO) twice a day or fosfomycin 3g PO single dose are the preferred agents. However, it is important to note that UTIs could be secondary to colonization and removal of the catheter could be therapeutic. For bacteremia, monotherapy with ampicillin often can be used as well. However, this does not provide bactericidal activity, so an aminoglycoside such as gentamycin can usually be added. Ampicillin with ceftriaxone is an alternative regimen as it has similar efficacy to ampicillin and gentamycin but is less nephrotoxic.\n\nIf sensitivities are not available, or for high levels of resistance to beta-lactams or aminoglycosides, linezolid, 600 mg PO or IV twice a day, can be used. A synthetic oxazolidinone antibiotic, this is a bacteriostatic drug that binds to the ribosome, preventing peptide bond formation. For endocarditis, linezolid has been shown to be an effective first-line medication, although it is a bacteriostatic drug. Adverse effects, especially after prolonged use, include thrombocytopenia, anemia, peripheral neuropathy, and risk of inducing serotonin syndrome. Alternatives should be considered with patients who regularly take serotonergic medications.\n\nAnother alternative is an off-label use of high dose daptomycin 8 to 12 mg/kg IV (with renal adjustment) once a day. A lipopeptide antibiotic, it is bactericidal and causes cell membrane depolarization. Importantly, if patients are persistently bacteremic or the minimum inhibitory concentration is high for daptomycin, then combination therapy with ampicillin or ceftaroline can be used. Patients should be evaluated for myopathy, and weekly creatine kinase levels should be obtained. Furthermore, daptomycin is not effective on pulmonary infections as surfactant inactivates it, but this is rarely a concern with vancomycin-resistant\nEnterococcus\nbecause enterococcal pneumonia is exceedingly rare.\n\nTigecycline, a glycylcycline antibiotic, can be used for patients who are intolerant to other agents. It also can be used if other infections are present with the vancomycin-resistant\nEnterococcus\nas it has good coverage against gram positives, some gram negatives, and anaerobes. Although it is off-label, it is specifically considered a preferred agent for polymicrobial intraabdominal infections. It should not be used for vancomycin-resistant\nEnterococcus\nbacteremia as it distributes primarily to tissues and achieves low serum concentrations. Typical dosing is 100 mg IV once followed by 50 mg IV twice a day. Patients should be monitored for major adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting.\n\nChloramphenicol, at 50 to 100 mg/kg/day divided into doses every 6 hours (4 g/day max dose), has been used successfully to treat vancomycin-resistant\nEnterococcus\nbacteremia for many years and has excellent tissue penetration, including the CNS. Due to its high incidence of toxicity and adverse effects, such as aplastic anemia or bone marrow suppression, it should not be used as a first-line agent when other options are available and should generally be initiated in consultation with an infectious-disease specialist. It remains an option in resource-poor environments where modern drugs may not be available.\n[7]\n[15]\n[16]\n[7]",
