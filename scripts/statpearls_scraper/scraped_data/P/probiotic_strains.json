    "clinical_significance": "Gut microbial populations can be modified through various therapeutic and surgical approaches, presenting several methods of treating obesity. One such avenue is using probiotic supplements to provide live bacteria to restore the gut microbiota biodiversity lost in patients with obesity.\n[46]\nBifidobacterium\nis a common microbial species in probiotics that appears to reduce intestinal permeability, which can be expected to protect against harmful bacteria and other toxins entering the circulation, causing inflammation.\n[17]\nRecently, more research has been exploring the potential use of certain strains of\nLactobacillus\nto treat obesity.\n[47]\n[48]\nSpecific prebiotics and other dietary supplements that stimulate the growth of potentially therapeutic bacteria have also been suggested for treating obesity. An example is fish oil, which may alter populations of\nBifidobacterium\nand other species to improve intestinal barrier integrity.\n[49]\n\nSurgical interventions that alter gut microbiota composition may also serve to treat obesity. Gastric bypass surgery decreases food intake and body weight. This surgical procedure also increases the population of\nA muciniphila\nand other species. These same therapeutic effects have been shown when these bacteria species are transferred to germ-free mice. The effects of gastric bypass on gut microbiota suggest that gut microbiota changes may at least partially explain the impact of gastric bypass on reducing obesity.\n[2]\nFecal microbiota transplantation is a method whereby microbiota populations within fecal material from lean individuals are transferred to patients with obesity. Researchers are exploring fecal microbiota transplantation as a potential method of treating obesity by mitigating dysbiosis. Still, more research is needed to refine its limitations and confirm its safety and efficacy in treating obesity.\n[2]\n[50]\n\nLifestyle and diet may play an essential role in maintaining gut microbiota homeostasis. Dietary changes can influence the microbial population in early life, impacting the individual long-term. Nondietary factors can also impact gastrointestinal tract microbiota. For example, smoking has been associated with increased\nBacteroides-Prevotella\nand may contribute to Crohn disease.\n[4]\nSmoking may also affect the microbiota in such a way as to increase the risk of colorectal cancer.\n[51]\nMore research is needed into dietary changes, prebiotics, and probiotics to modify gastrointestinal microbiota positively. Lifestyle modification should usually be introduced along with any planned pharmacologic interventions. These changes include diet modification and smoking cessation."
