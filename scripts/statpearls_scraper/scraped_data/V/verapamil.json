    "indications": "Oral Formulation\n\nIf the patient has hypersensitivity to verapamil or any component in the verapamil formulation (immediate-release or extended-release)\nSevere dysfunction of the left ventricle\nSevere hypotension, defined as a systolic blood pressure reading of less than 90 mmHg or cardiogenic shock (except in patients with a functioning artificial ventricular pacemaker)\nSick sinus syndrome and second or third-degree atrioventricular block (the main exception being in patients who have a functioning artificial ventricular pacemaker)\nAtrial flutter/fibrillation with an accessory bypass tract (Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome, Wolff-Parkinson-White [WPW] syndrome)\n\nIntravenous Formulation\n\nSevere heart failure (unless the heart failure results from a supraventricular tachycardia responsive to verapamil)\nConcomitant use of intravenous beta-blockers",
    "mechanism": "Verapamil is a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. Calcium channel blockers inhibit the entry of calcium ions into the slow L-type calcium channels in the myocardium and vascular smooth muscle during depolarization. This inhibition will produce relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle as well as coronary vasodilation, which is helpful in patients with hypertension. Verapamil also increases myocardial oxygen delivery, which helps patients with vasospastic angina. Verapamil correlates with negative chronotropic effects and decreased sympathetic nervous system activity.\n[5]\n[6]",
    "administration": "Verapamil can be administered either orally (sustained release or immediate release) or intravenously. It is possible to open sustained-release verapamil capsules, and the contents are sprinkled on one tablespoon of applesauce. Patients should receive instructions to swallow immediately with a full glass of cool water. For sustained verapamil products, take with food and swallow whole (they should not be chewed or crushed). When given intravenously, verapamil administration must be over at least a two-minute timeframe.\n\nHypertension\n\nFor immediate-release formulations, the usual dose range is 120 to 360 mg/day given in three divided doses; the maximum dose is 480 mg/day.\n[7]\nFor geriatric patients, consider lower initial doses and titrate to response.\n[8]\nFor immediate-release oral formulations, the initial dose is 40 mg three times daily (TID).\nFor extended-release oral formulations, give an initial dose of 120 mg once daily in the morning or 100 mg once daily at bedtime.\n\nAngina\n\nFor oral dosing, verapamil (immediate-release) should be given 80 mg to 160 mg three times a day (TID).\n[9]\n\nAtrial Fibrillation (AF)\n\nIntravenous\n[10]\nAdminister an initial bolus of 0.075 to 0.15 mg/kg over at least 2 minutes.\nIf the patient does not produce an adequate response, administer an additional 10 mg after 15 to 30 minutes.\nIf the patient produces an adequate response to the initial (or repeat bolus) dose, initiate a continuous infusion.\nOral\n[11]\nFor extended-release formulations, initiate a maintenance dose of 180 to 480 mg once daily.\nFor immediate release formulations, initiate a dose of 240 to 480 mg daily in 3 to 4 divided doses; the maximum daily dose should be 480 mg/day.\n\nIVT\n\nIntravenous\nAdminister 2.5 to 5.0 mg every 15 to 30 minutes\n[12]\n[13]\nOral\nFor immediate-release, formulations administer 360 mg/day in three divided doses.\nFor extended-release formulations, administer 240 to 480 mg once daily.\n[14]\n[15]\n\nCluster Headaches\n\nOral: For immediate release formulations, administer 240 mg in three divided doses; if this dose does not produce an adequate response, increase the dose by 80 mg every 1 to 2 weeks until symptoms have alleviated or adverse reactions occur.\n[16]\n[17]\n\nPSVT Prophylaxis\n\nDosed orally For immediate release formulations, the usual dosage range is between 240 mg and 480 mg in 3 to 4 divided doses.\n[18]\n\nOngoing Management of SVT\n\nFor immediate release formulations, administer an initial dose of 120 mg in divided doses; the maximum maintenance dose is 480 mg/day.\n\nAcute Treatment of Supraventricular Tachycardia\n\nACLS Guidelines\n\nAdminister 2.5 to 5 mg over 2 minutes (over 3 minutes in geriatric patients) administer a second dose of 5 to 10 mg (approximately 0.15 mg/kg) may be given 15 to 30 minutes after the initial dose only if: the patient does not experience any adverse reactions but does not respond to initial treatment.\n[18]\nThe maximum total dose is 20 to 30 mg.\n[19]\n\nACC/AHA/HRS SVT Guidelines\n\nAdminister 5 to 10 mg (0.075 to 0.15 mg/kg) over 2 minutes\nIf the patient has no response to this dose, a second dose can be given 30 minutes after the initial dose, followed by an infusion of 0.005 mg/kg/minute.",
    "adverse_effects": "Adverse Effects\n\nGingival hyperplasia\nConstipation\nPeripheral edema\nHypotension\nFatigue\nDyspepsia\n\nPrecautions\n\nMay cause first-degree AV block; higher degrees of AV block could occur in patients with sick sinus syndrome - consider a dosage reduction or discontinue verapamil therapy.\n[19]\nIt is considered contraindicated in patients with wide complex tachycardias unless it can be proven to be supraventricular in origin; severe hypotension could occur upon administration.\n[20]\nAvoid use in patients with heart failure, particularly heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction, due to a higher risk than benefit in using calcium channel blockers overall.\n[21]\nUse with caution in patients with HCM with outflow tract obstruction, including those:\nWith high gradients\nAdvanced heart failure\nSinus bradycardia\nVerapamil should not be used in those with HCM and systemic hypotension or severe difficulty breathing at rest.\n[22]\n\nPregnancy\n\nVerapamil can cross the placenta.\nPregnancy Category C\n[23]\nUse during pregnancy may cause adverse effects on the fetus(e.g., bradycardia, heart block, hypotension)\nWomen with HCM controlled with verapamil before pregnancy may continue therapy, but it is recommended to monitor the fetus for slow heart rate, low blood pressure, and heart block.\n[21]\nIt may be used intravenously for the acute treatment of SVT in pregnant women when adenosine or beta-blockers are ineffective or contraindicated. Verapamil may also be used for the ongoing management of SVT in highly symptomatic patients; the recommendation is for the lowest effective dose; avoid use during the first trimester if possible.\n[18]\nIf treatment for hypertension during pregnancy is needed, it is recommended to change to an alternative agent. (ACOG 2013)\n[24]\n\nBreast-Feeding\n\nAlthough verapamil is present in breast milk, the relative infant dose of verapamil is less than or equal to 1% of the weight-adjusted maternal dose, which is below the required RID limit of less than 10 %.\n[25]\n[26]\nTherefore, breastfeeding is acceptable for verapamil, though some manufacturers are against it.\n[27]\n[28]\n[29]\n[25]\n\nThe authors of several case reports calculated the RID of verapamil following maternal use of verapamil 80 to 120 mg three times daily in women less than or equal to 3 months postpartum. Adverse events were not observed in breastfed infants.",
    "monitoring": "The clinician should monitor their blood pressure, heart rate, and liver function tests for patients who are on verapamil.\n\nGoals of Therapy\n\nBlood pressure is an essential indicator of how the patient with confirmed hypertension is doing with verapamil. The ASCVD risk and comorbidities of the patient require an evaluation to evaluate the specific blood pressure goal for the patient.\n[30]\nIf the patient with confirmed hypertension has known cardiovascular disease or a 10-year ASCVD risk greater than or equal to 10%, then the recommended target blood pressure is less than 130/80 mm Hg - for patients without markers of increased ASCVD risk, a target blood pressure less than 130/80 is not a recommendation but is a reasonable goal.\n[30]\n\nSpecial Populations\n\nRenal Impairment:\nIf repeated intravenous injections are necessary for therapy, monitor blood pressure, and PR readings\nLiver Impairment (Cirrhosis):\nMonitor ECG and reduce dose to:\n20% in oral formulations\n50% in intravenous formulations",
    "toxicity": "Like all calcium channel blockers, an overdose of verapamil can lead to negative inotropic and chronotropic effects, dilation of arterial vasculature, and hypotension. Additionally, verapamil’s blockade of slow calcium channels in pancreatic beta cells can lead to inhibited insulin release, thereby causing hyperglycemia. If a patient experiences bradycardia with hypotension/metabolic acidosis and hyperglycemia is indicative of verapamil toxicity. The most serious complications from a verapamil overdose are bradycardia and hypotension, as both can lead to death if the patient is left untreated.\n\nIf a patient presents with verapamil toxicity within 1 hour, two decontamination procedures exist; gastric lavage and single-dose activated charcoal.\n[31]\n[32]\nIf a patient presents with verapamil toxicity after 1 hour of ingestion has elapsed, whole bowel irrigation using polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution is a viable decontamination procedure.\n[33]\nAccording to experimental and clinical studies, ipecac and cathartics have not proven beneficial decontamination procedures.\n[33]\n[34]\n[35]\n\nTreatment of Calcium Channel Blocker Overdose\n[36]\n\nPatients with symptoms should undergo treatment with the prioritization of first-line therapy. Determination of which treatment is first-line depends upon the desired effect to include:\n\nIntravenous calcium\nHigh dose insulin monotherapy (in patients with myocardial dysfunction)\nNorepinephrine or epinephrine if the patient is suffering from shock (norepinephrine is preferable in patients with vasodilatory shock)\n\nPatients refractory to first-line therapies:\n\nFat emulsion therapies\nIncremental doses of high dose insulin therapy – in patients with myocardial dysfunction\nUse of a pacemaker – in patients with unstable bradycardia/high-grade AV block without significant alteration in cardiac inotropy\n\nPatients with refractory shock/precardiac-arrest:\n\nIncremental doses of high dose insulin\nFat emulsion therapy\nVenoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (only to be used when the refractory shock contains a significant cardiogenic component)\n\nAdministration of calcium chloride or calcium gluconate in symptomatic patients is another therapeutic alternative. Calcium chloride is used in nonacidotic patients because it delivers three times the amount of calcium than calcium gluconate. In contrast, calcium gluconate is used in acidotic patients because calcium chloride could worsen the acidosis. Both calcium formulations must have IV administration."
