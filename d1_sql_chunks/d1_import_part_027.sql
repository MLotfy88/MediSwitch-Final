The hetero-octomeric complex of the channel is composed of four pore-forming Kir6.2 subunits and four regulatory sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) subunits. Alternative splicing allows the formation of channels composed of varying subunit isoforms expressed at different concentrations in different tissues.[A177730] In pancreatic beta cells, ATP-sensitive potassium channels play a role as essential metabolic sensors and regulators that couple membrane excitability with glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS).[A177727] When there is a decrease in the ATP:ADP ratio, the channels are activated and open, leading to K+ efflux from the cell, membrane hyperpolarization, and suppression of insulin secretion.[A177727] In contrast, increased uptake of glucose into the cell leads to elevated intracellular ATP:ADP ratio, leading to the closure of channels and membrane depolarization. Depolarization leads to activation and opening of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and consequently an influx of calcium ions into the cell.[A177727] Elevated intracellular calcium levels causes the contraction of the filaments of actomyosin responsible for the exocytosis of insulin granules stored in vesicles.[A177715] Glimepiride blocks the ATP-sensitive potassium channel by binding non-specifically to the B sites of both sulfonylurea receptor-1 (SUR1) and sulfonylurea receptor-2A (SUR2A) subunits as well as the A site of SUR1 subunit of the channel to promote insulin secretion from the beta cell.[A177715] ', 'Glimepiride stimulates the secretion of insulin granules from the pancreatic beta cells and improves the sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin to increase peripheral glucose uptake, thus reducing plasma blood glucose levels and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels.

It is estimated that the activity of GLP-1 and GIP contribute more than 70% to the insulin response to an oral glucose challenge. They stimulate insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner via G-protein-coupled GIP and GLP-1 receptor signalling. In addition to their effects on insulin secretion, GLP-1 is also involved in promoting islet neogenesis and differentiation, as well as attenuating pancreatic beta-cell apoptosis. Incretin hormones also exert extra-pancreatic effects, such as lipogenesis and myocardial function.[A232523] In type II diabetes mellitus, GLP-1 secretion is impaired, and the insulinotropic effect of GIP is significantly diminished.[A232488]



Vildagliptin exerts its blood glucose-lowering effects by selectively inhibiting dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), an enzyme that rapidly truncates and inactivates GLP-1 and GIP upon their release from the intestinal cells. DPP-4 cleaves oligopeptides after the second amino acid from the N-terminal end. Inhibition of DPP-4 substantially prolongs the half-life of GLP-1 and GIP, increasing the levels of active circulating incretin hormones.[A232523] The duration of DPP-4 inhibition by vildagliptin is dose-dependent.[A232533] Vildagliptin reduces fasting and prandial glucose and HbA1c. It enhances the glucose sensitivity of alpha- and beta-cells and augments glucose-dependent insulin secretion. Fasting and postprandial glucose levels are decreased, and postprandial lipid and lipoprotein metabolism are also improved.[A232488,A232528]', 'Vildagliptin works to improve glycemic control in type II diabetes mellitus by enhancing the glucose sensitivity of beta-cells (β-cells) in pancreatic islets and promoting glucose-dependent insulin secretion. Increased GLP-1 levels leads to enhanced sensitivity of alpha cells to glucose, promoting glucagon secretion. Vildagliptin causes an increase in the insulin to glucagon ratio by increasing incretin hormone levels: this results in a decrease in fasting and postprandial hepatic glucose production. Vildagliptin does not affect gastric emptying. It also has no effects on insulin secretion or blood glucose levels in individuals with normal glycemic control.[L32803]

This This 6-member ring enables cefdinir and other cephalosporins to resist inactivation by certain bacterial enzymes.[A180772]



With a mechanism similar to other beta-lactam antibiotics, the bactericidal activity of cefdinir is caused by the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Cefdinir, like other cephalosporins, penetrates the bacterial cell wall, combats inactivation by beta-lactamase enzymes, and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins.[A180772] This interferes with the final step of transpeptidation in cell walls, eventually leading to cell lysis, which eventually leads to the death of bacteria that are susceptible to this drug.[A180724] Cefdinir has shown affinity to penicillin protein binding proteins 2 and 3. [A15746,A180760,A15747] It has also been shown to inhibit transpeptidase enzymes of various bacteria, which may play a role in its bactericidal action.[A180766,A180769] One in vitro study suggests that cefdinir inhibits myeloperoxidase release extracellularly.[A11897] The impact of this potential drug target in relation to its mechanism of action is unknown.', 'Cefdinir is a bactericidal agent that treats bacterial infections by interfering with cell wall synthesis.[L7330]

Due to its activity against prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis, ibuprofen has been attributed to alteration of platelet function and prolongation of gestation and labour.[A39092]



As ibuprofen is a widely used medication, the main therapeutic indications are:



* Patent Ductus Arteriosus - it is a neonatal condition wherein the ductus arteriosus (blood vessel that connects the main pulmonary artery to the proximal descending aorta) fails to close after birth causing severe risk of heart failure. The prostaglandin inhibition of ibuprofen has been studied for the treatment of this condition as it is known that prostaglandin E2 is responsible for keeping the ductus arteriosus open.[A39100]



* Rheumatoid- and osteo-arthritis - ibuprofen is very commonly used in the symptomatic treatment of inflammatory, musculoskeletal and rheumatic disorders.[A39176]



* Cystic fibrosis - the use of high dosages of ibuprofen has been proven to decrease inflammation and decreasing polymorphonuclear cell influx in the lungs.[A39177]



* Orthostatic hypotension - ibuprofen can induce sodium retention and antagonize the effect of diuretics which has been reported to be beneficial for patients with severe orthostatic hypotension.[A1651]



* Dental pain - ibuprofen is used to manage acute and chronic orofacial pain.[A10901]



* Pain - ibuprofen is widely used to reduce minor aches and pains as well as to reduce fever and manage dysmenorrhea. It is very commonly used for the relief of acute indications such as fever and tension headaches.[A39092] It is also used to manage mild to moderate pain and moderate to severe pain as an adjunct to opioid analgesics.[L40208]



* Investigational uses - efforts have been put into developing ibuprofen for the prophylaxis of Alzheimer''s disease, Parkinson disease, and breast cancer.[A39092]', 'The exact mechanism of action of ibuprofen is unknown. However, ibuprofen is considered an NSAID and thus it is a non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, which is an enzyme involved in prostaglandin (mediators of pain and fever) and thromboxane (stimulators of blood clotting) synthesis via the arachidonic acid pathway.[L4614]



Ibuprofen is a non-selective COX inhibitor and hence, it inhibits the activity of both COX-1 and COX-2. The inhibition of COX-2 activity decreases the synthesis of prostaglandins involved in mediating inflammation, pain, fever, and swelling while the inhibition of COX-1 is thought to cause some of the side effects of ibuprofen including GI ulceration.[A39195]', 'Ibuprofen has multiple actions in different inflammatory pathways involved in acute and chronic inflammation. The main effects reported in ibuprofen are related to the control of pain, fever and acute inflammation by the inhibition of the synthesis of prostanoids by COX-1 and COX-2. Pain relief is attributed to peripheral affected regions and central nervous system effects in the pain transmission mediated by the dorsal horn and higher spinothalamic tract. Some reports have tried to link the pain regulation with a possible enhancement on the synthesis of endogenous cannabinoids and action on the NMDA receptors. The effect on pain has been shown to be related to the cortically evoked potentials.[A39190]



The antipyretic effect is reported to be linked to the effect on the prostanoid synthesis due to the fact that the prostanoids are the main signaling mediator of pyresis in the hypothalamic-preoptic region.[A39190]



The use of ibuprofen in dental procedures is attributed to the local inhibition of prostanoid production as well as to anti-oedemic activity and an increase of plasma beta-endorphins. Some reports have suggested a rapid local reduction of the expression of COX-2 in dental pulp derived by the administration of ibuprofen.[A39190]



The administration of ibuprofen in patients with rheumatic diseases has shown to control joint symptoms.[A39092] 



Ibuprofen is largely used in OTC products such as an agent for the management of dysmenorrhea which has been proven to reduce the amount of menstrual prostanoids and to produce a reduction in the uterine hypercontractility.[A39181] As well, it has been reported to reduce significantly the fever and the pain caused by migraines.[A39182, A39183] This effect is thought to be related to the effect on platelet activation and thromboxane A2 production which produces local vascular effects in the affected regions. This effect is viable as ibuprofen can enter in the central nervous system.[A39190]



In the investigational uses of ibuprofen, it has been reported to reduce neurodegeneration when given in low doses over a long time.[A39184] On the other hand, its use in Parkinson disease is related to the importance of inflammation and oxidative stress in the pathology of this condition.[A39185] The use of ibuprofen for breast cancer is related to a study that shows a decrease of 50% in the rate of breast cancer.[A39186]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

It is often used in combination with [misoprostol] as a gastro-protective agent in patients with high risk of developing NSAID-induced ulcers.', 'Diclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 and -2, the enzymes responsible for production of prostaglandin (PG) G<sub>2</sub> which is the precursor to other PGs.[label,T116] These molecules have broad activity in pain and inflammation and the inhibition of their production is the common mechanism linking each effect of diclofenac.



PGE<sub>2</sub> is the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.[A179023] It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.[T116,A179023] PGE<sub>2</sub> activates the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled EP<sub>1</sub> receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE<sub>2</sub> also activates the EP<sub>4</sub> receptor, coupled to G<sub>s</sub>, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE<sub>2</sub> act via EP<sub>3</sub> to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP<sub>2</sub> to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI<sub>2</sub> is known to play a role via its G<sub>s</sub>-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.



PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP<sub>2</sub> receptors.[T116,A179044] Similarly to β adrenergic receptors these are G<sub>s</sub>-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE<sub>2</sub> also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.[T116] PGD<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP<sub>1</sub> receptor.[A179044] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.



PGE<sub>2</sub> can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory G<sub>q</sub> EP<sub>3</sub> receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.[T116] This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever. NSAIDs prevent the generation of PGE<sub>2</sub> thereby reducing the activity of these neurons.

Topical tretinoin is also indicated alone [L45389] or in combination with [benzoyl peroxide] [L34869] or [clindamycin] [L45384] for the treatment of acne vulgaris. It is also used in prescription and over-the-counter for treating various skin conditions such as melasma,[L45394] hyperpigmentation,[A257474] and photoaging [A258180] alone or in combination with other drugs.', 'The exact mechanism of action of tretinoin in skin conditions and acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) has not been fully elucidated; however, several proposed mechanisms exist. Tretinoin is believed to exert its pharmacological actions by binding to and activating two types of nuclear receptors - retinoic acid receptors (RARs) alpha, beta, and gamma and retinoid X receptors (RXRs). In the human skin, RARs (especially RAR-alpha) form heterodimers with RXR to act as inducible transcription regulators of genes involved in cell differentiation by binding to retinoic acid response elements.[A257724,A258185] Tretinoin binds to RXRs to promote epidermal proliferation. It also blocks the actions of inflammatory mediators, enhancing procollagen production and collagen type I and III formations.[A257474,A257629,A257609,A257699] Some animal and human studies suggest that tretinoin induces the expression of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), which stimulates the transcription of several types of collagen messenger RNA. Collagen formation curtails further solar UV-induced skin damage and aging processes.[A257699]



Acne is associated with abnormal follicular formation from excessive keratinization of epithelial cells. Tretinoin promotes cornified cell detachment and enhances keratinocyte shedding. It also stimulates mitotic activity and loosely-adherent corneocyte turnover to expel comedo contents, reducing microcomedo precursor lesions of acne vulgaris.[A257474,L34869] Tretinoin may reduce epidermal melanin and pigmentation by increasing keratinocyte turnover and reducing tyrosinase activity.[A257609,A258180]



RAR-alpha and -beta have also been implicated in APL.[A257724] APL is characterized by a t(15;17) chromosomal translocation, which fuses the promyelocytic myeloid leukemia (PML) gene with the RAR-alpha gene.[A257689,A257694] The resulting PML-RAR-alpha fusion protein plays a role in the pathogenesis of APL by aberrating promyelocyte differentiation. The PML-RAR-alpha fusion protein is found to be predominant in leukemic cells, exerting a dominant negative effect on RAR, RXR and PML function.[A257689] Tretinoin induces terminal differentiation in hemopoietic precursor cell lines and APL cells.[A257694] Tretinoin is believed to promote caspase-mediated cleavage and proteasome-dependent degradation to cause apoptosis and degradation of the PML-RAR-alpha fusion protein.[A257474] It may also convert the fusion protein from a transcription repressor to an activator.[A257474]', 'Tretinoin is a vitamin A derivative that promotes cell production, proliferation, and differentiation. When used topically, tretinoin regulates epidermal cell turnover and collagen production. It also prevents collagen loss, reduces inflammation, and blocks the induction of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), which are enzymes that disrupt collagen and elastic fibres.[A257474,A257629,A257609,A258180] In short-term and long-term studies, topical application of tretinoin at doses ranging from 0.001% to 0.1% was associated with improvements in clinical signs of photoaging and fine wrinkles, increased epidermal thickness, compaction of the stratum corneum, and decreased melanin content.[A257684,A258180,A258185,A257699] It also improved melanocyte differentiation and distribution, promotion of epidermal hyperplasia, and angiogenesis.[A257699]

This action promotes the release of histamine from ECL cells. Upon release, histamine acts on H<sub>2</sub> receptors expressed on the basolateral membrane of parietal cells, leading to increased intracellular cAMP levels and activated proton pumps on parietal cells. Proton pump releases more protons into the stomach, thereby increasing the secretion of acid.

Most drug therapies aim to alleviate symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia, silodosin included. Lower urinary tract symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia are categorized into three main groups: voiding or obstructive (hesitancy, slow stream, intermittency, incomplete emptying), storage or irritative (frequency, urgency, nocturia, urge urinary incontinence), and postmicturition (postvoid dribbling). Prostate contraction is the main contributor to lower urinary tract symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. The smooth muscle tone of the prostate is regulated by α<sub>1A</sub>-adrenoceptors, which are the most highly expressed subtype of α<sub>1</sub>adrenoceptors in the human prostate tissue.[A231159] It has been reported that blockade of α<sub>1A</sub>-adrenoceptors relieves bladder outlet obstruction. Blockade of α<sub>1D</sub>-adrenoceptors, another subtype found in prostate tissue, is believed to alleviate storage symptoms due to detrusor overactivity.[A231229]



α<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors are G protein-coupled receptors: upon binding of its natural ligand, norepinephrine and epinephrine, leads to the activation of phospholipase C and downstream signalling molecules, including inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol. Ultimately, there is an increase in intracellular calcium levels and, consequently, smooth muscle contraction. Silodosin is an antagonist of α<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors, with the highest selectivity for the α<sub>1A</sub>-adrenoceptor subtype. By blocking the α<sub>1A</sub>-adrenoceptor signalling pathway, silodosin promotes prostatic and urethral smooth muscle relaxation, thereby improving lower urinary tract symptoms such as voiding. Silodosin also targets afferent nerves in the bladder, relieving bladder overactivity and storage symptoms.[A231159]', 'Silodosin is an antagonist of α<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors. It has the highest selectivity for the α<sub>1A</sub>-adrenoceptor subtype, with a 162-fold greater affinity than α<sub>1B</sub>-adrenoceptor and about a 50-fold greater affinity than for α<sub>1D</sub>-adrenoceptor. In clinical trials, silodosin improved maximum urinary flow rate, voiding symptoms, and storage symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia.[A231159, A231174] Following oral administration, silodosin had a rapid onset of effect in men,[A231174] with early effects of relieving lower urinary tract symptoms occurring within two to six hours post-dose.[A231229]

A number of studies have shown that melatonin may be effective for treating sleep-wake cycle disturbances in children and adolescents with mental retardation, autism, and other central nervous system disorders.

', 'Melatonin is a derivative of tryptophan. It binds to melatonin receptor type 1A, which then acts on adenylate cylcase and the inhibition of a cAMP signal transduction pathway. Melatonin not only inhibits adenylate cyclase, but it also activates phosphilpase C. This potentiates the release of arachidonate. By binding to melatonin receptors 1 and 2, the downstream signallling cascades have various effects in the body. The melatonin receptors are G protein-coupled receptors and are expressed in various tissues of the body. There are two subtypes of the receptor in humans, melatonin receptor 1 (MT1) and melatonin receptor 2 (MT2). Melatonin and melatonin receptor agonists, on market or in clinical trials, all bind to and activate both receptor types.The binding of the agonists to the receptors has been investigated for over two decades or since 1986. It is somewhat known, but still not fully understood. When melatonin receptor agonists bind to and activate their receptors it causes numerous physiological processes.

MT1 receptors are expressed in many regions of the central nervous system (CNS): suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SNC), hippocampus, substantia nigra, cerebellum, central dopaminergic pathways, ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens. MT1 is also expressed in the retina, ovary, testis, mammary gland, coronary circulation and aorta, gallbladder, liver, kidney, skin and the immune system. MT2 receptors are expressed mainly in the CNS, also in the lung, cardiac, coronary and aortic tissue, myometrium and granulosa cells, immune cells, duodenum and adipocytes.

The binding of melatonin to melatonin receptors activates a few signaling pathways. MT1 receptor activation inhibits the adenylyl cyclase and its inhibition causes a rippling effect of non activation; starting with decreasing formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and then progressing to less protein kinase A (PKA) activity, which in turn hinders the phosphorilation of cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB binding protein) into P-CREB. MT1 receptors also activate phospholipase C (PLC), affect ion channels and regulate ion flux inside the cell. The binding of melatonin to MT2 receptors inhibits adenylyl cyclase which decreases the formation of cAMP.[4] As well it hinders guanylyl cyclase and therefore the forming of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Binding to MT2 receptors probably affects PLC which increases protein kinase C (PKC) activity. Activation of the receptor can lead to ion flux inside the cell.', 'Melatonin is a hormone normally produced in the pineal gland and released into the blood. The essential amino acid L-tryptophan is a precursor in the synthesis of melatonin. It helps regulate sleep-wake cycles or the circadian rhythm. Production of melatonin is stimulated by darkness and inhibited by light. High levels of melatonin induce sleep and so consumption of the drug can be used to combat insomnia and jet lag.

MT1 and MT2 receptors may be a target for the treatment of circadian and non circadian sleep disorders because of their differences in pharmacology and function within the SCN. SCN is responsible for maintaining the 24 hour cycle which regulates many different body functions ranging from sleep to immune functions

Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]', 'Pitavastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A181421] Pitavastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which increase hepatic uptake of LDL, thereby reducing circulating LDL-C levels. 



In vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that statins exert vasculoprotective effects independent of their lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] This includes improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response.



Statins have also been found to bind allosterically to β2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and in T cell activation.[A181559]', 'Pitavastatin is an oral antilipemic agent which inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. It is used to lower total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and trigleride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, rosuvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A181087, A181406]



Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]



**Skeletal Muscle Effects**



Pitavastatin may cause myopathy (muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness with creatine kinase (CK) above ten times the upper limit of normal) and rhabdomyolysis (with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria). Rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis with statin use, including pitavastatin. Predisposing factors for myopathy include advanced age (≥65 years), female gender, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. In most cases, muscle symptoms and CK increases resolved when treatment was promptly discontinued. As dosages of pitavastatin greater than 4mg per day were associated with an increased risk of severe myopathy, the product monograph recommends a maximum daily dose of 4mg once daily.[L48616]



The risk of myopathy during treatment with pitavstatin may be increased with concurrent administration of interacting drugs such as [fenofibrate], [niacin], [gemfibrozil], and [cyclosporine].  Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors coadministered with [colchicine], and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together.[L48616]



Real-world data from observational studies has suggested that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]



**Hepatic Dysfunction**



Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with pitavastatin. In most cases, the elevations were transient and either resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including pitavastatin.[L48616]



Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury.[L48616]



**Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels**

Indicated for the treatment of persistent (non-transient) facial erythema of rosacea in adults 18 years of age or older.[L6535]', 'In the eye, alpha-1 adrenoceptors play a role in vasoconstriction, mydriasis, eyelid retraction, and elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) whereas alpha-2 adrenoceptors are responsible for IOP reduction via a complex Gi-coupled signaling cascade pathway. Activation of alpha-2 receptors leads to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and reduction of cyclic AMP levels. As a result, there is a decrease in norpinephrine (NE) release at the synaptic junction, NE-induced stimulation of beta-2 adrenoceptors, and production of aqueous humor by the ciliary epithelium.[A178969] An elevated IOP is the most significant risk factor for developing glaucomatous optic neuropathy, which is associated with progressive visual field loss and functional disability if left untreated.[A179002] Regardless of the etiology of the disease, the aim of current therapies for glaucoma is to reduce IOP, as reduction of IOP significantly reduces the risk of progression of vision loss even when IOP is already within the normal range.[A36674] When administered ophthalmically, brimonidine is rapidly absorbed into the eye, acts as an agonist at ocular alpha-2 adrenoceptors and lowers IOP via a dual mechanism of action.[A178981] It is proposed that initial dosing of the drug causes a reduction in aqueous humour production and chronic dosing leads to an increase in uveoscleral outflow.[A179002] Brimonidine does not affect episcleral venous pressure.[A178969] By reducing IOP, brimonidine aims to reduce the likelihood of glaucomatous visual field loss in ocular hypertension, and slow the progression of visual field defect in established open-angle glaucoma.[A178951] When applied topically on skin, brimonidine reduces erythema through direct vasocontriction of small arteries and veins.[A178978] As brimonidine mediates a potent peripheral vasoconstrictive activity by selectively working on the alpha-2 adrenoceptors, the use of brimonidine is thought to be efficacious for the treatment of facial erythema of rosacea, which is thought to arise from vasomotor instability and abnormal vasodilation of the superficial cutaneous vasculature of the face.[A178984]', 'Brimonidine is a highly selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist that is 1000-fold more selective for the alpha2-adrenergic receptor than the alpha1-adrenergic receptor.[L6544] This characteristic gives the drug some therapeutic advantages, since it reduces the risk of systemic side effects, such as systemic hypotension, bradycardia, and sedation. In addition, there is a reduction in the risk for developing alpha-1 mediated ocular unwanted effects, such as conjunctival blanching, mydriasis, and eyelid retraction.[A179002] However, despite high alpha-2 receptor specificity, brimonidine may still produce alpha-1 adrenoceptor-mediated ocular effects, such as conjunctival vasoconstriction.[A178969] Brimonidine has a peak ocular hypotensive effect occurring at two hours post-dosing.[label] In a randomized, double-blind clinical study, ocular administration of 0.2% brimonidine in healthy volunteers resulted in a 23% reduction of mean intraocular pressure from baseline at 3 hours following administration.[A178951] In comparative studies consisting of patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, the ocular hypotensive effect of brimonidine was maintained during treatment periods of up to 1 year.[A178945] 



Brimonidine mediates vasoconstrictive effects and it was shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory properties in _ex vivo_ human skin model and _in vivo_ inflammation models.[A179041] In a clinial trials consisting of adults with moderate to severe facial erythema of rosacea, brimonidine was shown to improve the extent of redness at 3 hours after application, compared to placebo.[L6544] It was shown to be a potent vasoconstrictor of human subcutaneous vessels with a diameter of less than 200 µm. In _in vivo_ mouse inflammation models, brimonidine displayed anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting edema.[A178978] In a randomized, double-blind study, brimonidine reduced erythema for the 12 hours of the study in a dose-dependent manner.[A178978]



When adminsitered systemically, brimonidine was shown to cause cardiovascular effects by decreasing blood pressure, decreasing heart and respiratory rate, and prolonging the PR interval in the electrocardiogram. This is due to the targeting of adrenoceptors by the drug.[A178963,A178966] Although the clinical significance has not been established, there is evidence that brimonidine exhibits neuroprotective activity in experimental models of cerebral ischemia and optic nerve injury.[A178969] _In vitro_ studies show that brimonidine mediated protective effects on neuronal cells from kainate acid insult and on cultured retinal ganglion cells from glutamate-induced cytotoxicity, which is a possible mediator of secondary neuronal degeneration in human glaucoma. Neuroprotective actions of brimonidine were also demonstrated in rat models of acute retinal ischemia and chronic IOP elevation. It has been proposed that brimonidine may exert neuroprotective effects on the retina and optic nerve by enhancing intrinsic retinal ganglion cell survival mechanisms and/or induction of neuronal survival factors, such as bFGF.[A178951] However, further investigations are needed to conclude on these possible therapeutic benefits of the drug.', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Thrombin is a serine protease that is required to activate fibrinogen to fibrin, which is the loose meshwork that completes the clotting process.

When there is not enough Vitamin A to bind these receptors, natural cell differentiation and growth are interrupted.', 'Vitamin A is effective for the treatment of Vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A refers to a group of fat-soluble substances that are structurally related to and possess the biological activity of the parent substance of the group called all-<i>trans</i> retinol or retinol. Vitamin A plays vital roles in vision, epithelial differentiation, growth, reproduction, pattern formation during embryogenesis, bone development, hematopoiesis and brain development. It is also important for the maintenance of the proper functioning of the immune system.', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

', '**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].



Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].



In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].



There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].



Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].



The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. 



In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].



In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].



The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].', 'Zinc is involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of human proteins may bind zinc, in addition to hundreds of proteins that transport and traffic zinc. It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is an essential element for a proper sense of taste and smell and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations [L2211].



Studies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions [L2095]:



**Colds:** Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently [L2095].



**Wound healing:** Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements [L2095]. 



**Diahrrea**: Oral zinc supplements can reduce the symptoms of diarrhea in children with low levels of zinc, especially in cases of malnutrition [L2095].

Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]', 'Pitavastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A181421] Pitavastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which increase hepatic uptake of LDL, thereby reducing circulating LDL-C levels. 



In vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that statins exert vasculoprotective effects independent of their lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] This includes improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response.



Statins have also been found to bind allosterically to β2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and in T cell activation.[A181559]', 'Pitavastatin is an oral antilipemic agent which inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. It is used to lower total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and trigleride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, rosuvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A181087, A181406]



Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]



**Skeletal Muscle Effects**



Pitavastatin may cause myopathy (muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness with creatine kinase (CK) above ten times the upper limit of normal) and rhabdomyolysis (with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria). Rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis with statin use, including pitavastatin. Predisposing factors for myopathy include advanced age (≥65 years), female gender, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. In most cases, muscle symptoms and CK increases resolved when treatment was promptly discontinued. As dosages of pitavastatin greater than 4mg per day were associated with an increased risk of severe myopathy, the product monograph recommends a maximum daily dose of 4mg once daily.[L48616]



The risk of myopathy during treatment with pitavstatin may be increased with concurrent administration of interacting drugs such as [fenofibrate], [niacin], [gemfibrozil], and [cyclosporine].  Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors coadministered with [colchicine], and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together.[L48616]



Real-world data from observational studies has suggested that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]



**Hepatic Dysfunction**



Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with pitavastatin. In most cases, the elevations were transient and either resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including pitavastatin.[L48616]



Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury.[L48616]



**Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels**



Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with statins, including pitavastatin. Optimize lifestyle measures, including regular exercise, maintaining a healthy body weight, and making healthy food choices.[L48616]

Adalimumab has also been used off-label to treat Pyoderma gangrenosum.[A40001,A40002]', 'Adalimumab binds with specificity to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and inhibits its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. Adalimumab also lyses surface tumor necrosis factor expressing cells in vitro when in the presence of complement.[A39984,A39999] Adalimumab does not bind or inactivate lymphotoxin (Tumor necrosis factor-beta). TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that plays a role in normal inflammatory and immune responses.[A39999] Increased levels of TNF are found in the joint synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis patients, and play an imperative role in pathologic inflammation and joint destruction that are major complications of these diseases. Increased levels of TNF are also measured in psoriasis plaques. In plaque psoriasis, treatment with adalimumab may decrease the epidermal thickness and inflammatory cell infiltration. The relationship between these pharmacodynamics and the mechanism(s) by which adalimumab achieves its clinical effects is not known. Additionally, adalimumab alters biological responses that are induced/regulated by TNF, including changes in the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration during inflammation (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 with an IC50 of 1-2 X 10-10M).[L35370]', 'After treatment with adalimumab, a decrease in levels of acute phase reactant proteins of inflammation (C­ reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was measured compared to baseline in patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. A decrease in CRP levels was also observed in patients diagnosed with Crohn’s disease. Serum levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that lead to the tissue remodeling responsible for cartilage destruction were also found to be decreased after administration of adalimumab.[L35370] A reduction in signs and symptoms of disease, the induction of clinical response, inhibition of structural damage, and improvements in physical function in adult and pediatric patients with various inflammatory conditions have been demonstrated.[A39983, A39999, L35370]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Its role in potentiating insulin signalling cascades has been implicated in several studies. Chromium upregulates insulin-stimulated insulin signal transduction via affecting effector molecules downstream of the insulin receptor (IR). IR-mediated signalling pathway involves phoshorylation of multiple intracellular domains and protein kinases, and downstream effector molecules [A32353]. Upon activation by ligands, intracellular β-subunit of IR autophosphorylates and activates tyrosine kinase domain of the IR, followed by activation and phosphorylation of regulatory proteins and downstream signalling effectors including phosphatidylinositol 2-kinase (PI3K). PI3K activates further downstream reaction cascades to activate protein kinase B (Akt) to ultimately promote translocation of glucose transporter-4 (Glut4)-vesicles from the cytoplasm to the cell surface and regulate glucose uptake [A32353]. Chromium enhances the kinase activity of insulin receptor β and increases the activity of downstream effectors, pI3-kinase and Akt. 



Under insulin-resistant conditions, chromium also promotes GLUT-4 transporter translocation that is independent of activity of IR, IRS-1, PI3-kinase, or Akt; chromium mediates cholesterol efflux from the membranes via increasing fluidity of the membrane by decreasing the membrane cholesterol and upregulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein [A32353]. As a result, intracellular GLUT-4 transporters are stimulated to translocate from intracellular to the plasma membrane, leading to enhanced glucose uptake in muscle cells [L1990]. Chromium attenuates the activity of PTP-1B _in vitro,_ which is a negative regulator of insulin signaling. It also alleviates ER stress that is observed to be elevated the suppression of insulin signaling. ER stress is thought to activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which subsequently induces serine phosphorylation of IRS and aberration of insulin signalling [A32353]. Transient upregulation of AMPK by chromium also leads to increased glucose uptake [A32353]. ', 'Trivalent chromium is part of glucose tolerance factor, an essential activator of insulin-mediated reactions. Chromium helps to maintain normal glucose metabolism and peripheral nerve function. Chromium increases insulin binding to cells, increases insulin receptor density and activates insulin receptor kinase leading to enhanced insulin sensitivity [A32351].

Historically, cod liver oil was often given to children because the vitamin d content in the oil had been shown to prevent or treat vitamin D deficiency and condition of rickets associated with it [A33159]. Over time, this common use in children growing up may have conferred upon cod liver oil its identity as a healthy and useful all-purpose dietary supplement.



However, since cod liver oil is a composite of several other nutritional compounds including the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as well as vitamin A and vitamin D [A33159, L2872, L2871], the presence in varying amounts of all of these compounds at once makes it difficult to recommend or use cod liver oil as an appropriate supplement to confer any one particular health effect or for any one particular nutritional deficiency.



Regardless, because it does contain a combination of a number of important and healthy nutritional compounds, cod liver oil has sometimes been recommended in the literature for conferring the health effects of some of these compounds, such as the potential use of cod liver oil supplements in post-heart attack patients for secondary prophylaxis associated with the use of omega-3 fatty acids [A33165].', 'As cod liver oil consists of the component compounds of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), vitamin A, and vitamin D [A33159, L2872, L2871] further information about the mechanisms of action of these cod liver oil components can be found by searching for fish oil, vitamin A, and vitamin D on DrugBank.', 'As cod liver oil is a composite of several other nutritional compounds including the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as well as vitamin A and vitamin D [A33159, L2872, L2871], the presence in varying amounts of all of these compounds at once makes it difficult to recommend or use cod liver oil as an appropriate supplement to confer any one particular health effect or for any one particular nutritional deficiency.



For example, one tablespoon of cod liver oil contains approximately 4,080 ug of retinol (vitamin A) and 34 ug (1,360 IU) of vitamin D [L2871]. Since the general dietary reference intake of vitamin A is only 900 ug per day for adult men, 700 ug per day for women, and 3000 ug per day as the tolerable upper intake level, the regular intake of cod liver oil as a regular supplement can result in harmful levels of vitamin A accumulating in the liver and sufficient to cause hypervitaminosis A [A33163], which is associated with various symptoms such as blurred vision, changes in consciousness, skin and hair changes, liver damage, among many others.



Moreover, while cod liver oil only contains a certain percentage of the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA per amount of the oil [L2871], separate fish oils supplement products that exclusively consist of only EPA and DHA are available in a great variety of different percentage content formulations, even including prescription strength formulations should certain patients need such a level of therapy. Furthermore, such exclusive omega-3 fatty acid supplement products do not contain any vitamin A or D either, which allows patients to use the supplements without any concern about affecting their vitamin A or D levels or exposing themselves to the unnecessary excess intake of vitamins.



Subsequently, although cod liver oil contains a combination of healthy dietary supplements like EPA, DHA, vitamin A, and vitamin D, the presence in varying amounts of all of these compounds all at once makes it difficult to effectively titrate for appropriate amounts of intake for all the compounds involved when using cod liver oil as a general supplement, often resulting in either an excess or insufficient amount of one or more the aforementioned compounds.

Following irradiation, aloe polysaccharides block the upregulation of pro-apoptotic p53, Bax, and Bad while blocking downregulating anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 [A32473]. _In vivo_, aloe polysaccharides may act as a scavenger for oxygen free radicals including DPPH, alkyl radicals, superoxides, and singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals that may also be generated by superoxides [A32470, A32476]. Hydrogen peroxide, which is a weak initiate lipid peroxidation, may also be effectively scavenged by aloe polysaccharides [A32476]. In a Fenton reaction system, aloe polysaccharides demonstrated a concentration-dependent scavenging activity against hydroxyl radical that were generated during the reaction [A32476]. Aloe polysaccharides may also compete with oxygen to react with nitric oxide (NO), thereby inhibiting the generation of nitrite and peroxynitrite anions that act as free radicals [A32476]. 



Findings from a study investigating the effects of aloe polysaccharides on doxorubicin-induced oxidative stress suggest that aloe polysaccharides mediate potent antioxidant actions _in vivo_ [A32476]. Doxorubicin, known to generate reactive oxygen species such as superoxide and hydroxy radicals, was administered to albino rats. This led to myocardial oxidative stress and cardiac injury accompanied by leakage of LDH and CPK from cardiac myocytes and to serum due to lipid peroxidation of cardiac membranes, reduced levels of antioxidant coenzyme GSH, and increased levels of SOD from a compensatory and combative mechanism of oxidative stress [A32476]. Treatment with aloe polysaccharides resulted in a significant decrease in serum LDH and CPK levels, indicating that aloe polysaccharides are capable in stabilizing cardiac membranes from peroxidative damage. Restored levels of endogenous GSH and SOD in a dose-dependent manner were also observed with the treatment of aloe polysaccharides, suggesting that aloe polysaccharides exhibit potent antioxidant properties [A32476].



In a study of rats with open cutaneous back wounds, treatment with aloe polysaccharides decreased the levels of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) and induced tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) during the early stage of wound repair, resulting in decreased collagen breakdown and increased preservation of collagen content in the injured area [A32471]. A study proposes that acemannan, a common aloe polysaccharide, stimulates BMSC proliferation, ALPase activity, expression of VEGF, BMP-2, OPN, BSP, and mineralization leading to osteoblast differentiation and bone formation during socket healing [A32475]. ', 'Aloe polysaccharides mediate antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions, as well as immunoregulatory activities. Various studies indicate that aloe polysaccharides possess effective free radical scavenging activity _in vitro_, and produce potent antioxidant potential during oxidative stress _in vivo_ [A32476]. According to the findings of studies _in vitro_ and _in vivo_, aloe polysaccharides exhibit radioprotective activity. Treatment with acemmanan, which is a common aloe polysaccharide, on CH3 mice with radiation-induced skin reactions resulted in reduced signs of those reactions [A32473]. Studies suggest that aloe polysaccharides may evidently attenuate tumor growth in mice [A32473]. Treatment of aloe polysaccharides in Vero cells as well as in the in vivo zebrafish model led to protective effects against AAPH-indued oxidative stress resulting from accumulation of free radical species and improved cell viability [A32470].

Cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy are associated with the release of serotonin (5-HT) from enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine, presumably initiating a vomiting reflex through stimulation of 5-HT3 receptors located on vagal afferents [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Ondansetron may block the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a central release of serotonin from the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Thus, the antiemetic effect of ondansetron is probably due to the selective antagonism of 5-HT3 receptors on neurons located in either the peripheral or central nervous systems, or both [F3178, F3181, F3184].



Although the mechanisms of action of ondansetron in treating postoperative nausea and vomiting and cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting may share similar pathways, the role of ondansetron in opiate-induced emesis has not yet been formally established [F3181, F3184].', 'Ondansetron is a highly specific and selective serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist, not shown to have activity at other known serotonin receptors and with low affinity for dopamine receptors [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161]. The serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery, and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161]. The temporal relationship between the emetogenic action of emetogenic drugs and the release of serotonin, as well as the efficacy of antiemetic agents, suggest that chemotherapeutic agents release serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine by causing degenerative changes in the GI tract [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161]. The serotonin then stimulates the vagal and splanchnic nerve receptors that project to the medullary vomiting center, as well as the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors in the area postrema, thus initiating the vomiting reflex, causing nausea and vomiting [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161].



Moreover, the effect of ondansetron on the QTc interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo and positive (moxifloxacin) controlled, crossover study in 58 healthy adult men and women [F3181, F3184]. Ondansetron was tested at single doses of 8 mg and 32 mg infused intravenously over 15 minutes [F3181, F3184]. At the highest tested dose of 32 mg, prolongation of the Fridericia-corrected QTc interval (QT/RR0.33=QTcF) was observed from 15 min to 4 h after the start of the 15 min infusion, with a maximum mean (upper limit of 90% CI) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline-correction of 19.6 (21.5) msec at 20 min [F3181, F3184]. At the lower tested dose of 8 mg, QTc prolongation was observed from 15 min to 1 h after the start of the 15-minute infusion, with a maximum mean (upper limit of 90% CI) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline-correction of 5.8 (7.8) msec at 15 min [F3181, F3184]. The magnitude of QTc prolongation with ondansetron is expected to be greater if the infusion rate is faster than 15 minutes [F3181, F3184]. The 32 mg intravenous dose of ondansetron must not be administered [F3181, F3184]. No treatment-related effects on the QRS duration or the PR interval were observed at either the 8 or 32 mg dose [F3181, F3184].



An ECG assessment study has not been performed for orally administered ondansetron [F3181, F3184]. On the basis of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling, an 8 mg oral dose of ondansetron is predicted to cause a mean QTcF increase of 0.7 ms (90% CI -2.1, 3.3) at steady-state, assuming a mean maximal plasma concentration of 24.7 ng/mL (95% CI 21.1, 29.0) [F3181, F3184]. The magnitude of QTc prolongation at the recommended 5 mg/m2 dose in pediatrics has not been studied, but pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling predicts a mean increase of 6.6 ms (90% CI 2.8, 10.7) at maximal plasma concentrations [F3181, F3184]. 



In healthy subjects, single intravenous doses of 0.15 mg/kg of ondansetron had no effect on esophageal motility, gastric motility, lower esophageal sphincter pressure, or small intestinal transit time [F3178]. Multiday administration of ondansetron has been shown to slow colonic transit in healthy subjects [F3178]. Ondansetron has no effect on plasma prolactin concentrations [F3178].', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Risperidone is additionally indicated in Canada for the short-term symptomatic management of aggression or psychotic symptoms in patients with severe dementia of the Alzheimer type unresponsive to nonpharmacological approaches.[L12906]



Risperidone is also used off-label for a number of conditions including as an adjunct to antidepressants in treatment-resistant depression.[A177226]', 'Though its precise mechanism of action is not fully understood, current focus is on the ability of risperidone to inhibit the D2 dopaminergic receptors and 5-HT2A serotonergic receptors in the brain. Schizophrenia is thought to result from an excess of dopaminergic D2 and serotonergic 5-HT2A activity, resulting in overactivity of central mesolimbic pathways and mesocortical pathways, respectively.[A1115, A1116, A1117]



D2 dopaminergic receptors are transiently inhibited by risperidone, reducing dopaminergic neurotransmission, therefore decreasing positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as delusions and hallucinations.[A251765] Risperidone binds transiently and with loose affinity to the dopaminergic D2 receptor, with an ideal receptor occupancy of 60-70% for optimal effect.[A1119,A31773] Rapid dissociation of risperidone from the D2 receptors contributes to decreased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), which occur with permanent and high occupancy blockade of D2 dopaminergic receptors.[A1118,A1119] Low-affinity binding and rapid dissociation from the D2 receptor distinguish risperidone from the traditional antipsychotic drugs. A higher occupancy rate of D2 receptors is said to increase the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms and is therefore to be avoided.[A1118,A1119,A31771] 

 

Increased serotonergic mesocortical activity in schizophrenia results in negative symptoms, such as depression and decreased motivation. The high-affinity binding of risperidone to 5-HT2A receptors leads to a decrease in serotonergic activity. In addition, 5-HT2A receptor blockade results in decreased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms, likely by increasing dopamine release from the frontal cortex, and not the nigrostriatal tract. Dopamine level is therefore not completely inhibited.[A1117,A1119] Through the above mechanisms, both serotonergic and D2 blockade by risperidone are thought to synergistically work to decrease the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms. 

 

Risperidone has also been said to be an antagonist of alpha-1 (α1), alpha-2 (α2), and histamine (H1) receptors.[A37034] Blockade of these receptors is thought to improve symptoms of schizophrenia, however the exact mechanism of action on these receptors is not fully understood at this time.[L12885]', 'The primary action of risperidone is to decrease dopaminergic and serotonergic pathway activity in the brain, therefore decreasing symptoms of schizophrenia and mood disorders.[A1115,A1116]



Risperidone has a high binding affinity for serotonergic 5-HT2A receptors when compared to dopaminergic D2 receptors in the brain.[A1114,A1115] Risperidone binds to D2 receptors with a lower affinity than first-generation antipsychotic drugs, which bind with very high affinity. A reduction in extrapyramidal symptoms with risperidone, when compared to its predecessors, is likely a result of its moderate affinity for dopaminergic D2 receptors.[A1119,A1117]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Its action on presynaptic AT<sub>1</sub> receptors results in the inhibition of sympathetically stimulated noradrenaline release.

The α4β7 integrin is expressed on the surface of a discrete subset of memory T-lymphocytes that preferentially migrate into the gastrointestinal tract. Mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) is mainly expressed on gut endothelial cells and plays a critical role in homing T-lymphocytes to gut lymph tissue. The interaction of the α4β7 integrin with MAdCAM-1 has been implicated as an important contributor to chronic inflammation, a hallmark of ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease.

Neuroendocrine cells called enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells lie close to the parietal cells and regulate the basal secretion of histamine. Histamine release is also promoted from stimulation by acetylcholine and gastrin, a peptide hormone. Gastrin (G) cells release gastrin, which works on CCK<sub>2</sub> receptors on ECL cells. This action promotes the release of histamine from ECL cells. Upon release, histamine acts on H<sub>2</sub> receptors expressed on the basolateral membrane of parietal cells, leading to increased intracellular cAMP levels and activated proton pumps on parietal cells.

Cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy are associated with the release of serotonin (5-HT) from enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine, presumably initiating a vomiting reflex through stimulation of 5-HT3 receptors located on vagal afferents [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Ondansetron may block the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a central release of serotonin from the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Thus, the antiemetic effect of ondansetron is probably due to the selective antagonism of 5-HT3 receptors on neurons located in either the peripheral or central nervous systems, or both [F3178, F3181, F3184].



Although the mechanisms of action of ondansetron in treating postoperative nausea and vomiting and cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting may share similar pathways, the role of ondansetron in opiate-induced emesis has not yet been formally established [F3181, F3184].', 'Ondansetron is a highly specific and selective serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist, not shown to have activity at other known serotonin receptors and with low affinity for dopamine receptors [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161]. The serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery, and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161]. The temporal relationship between the emetogenic action of emetogenic drugs and the release of serotonin, as well as the efficacy of antiemetic agents, suggest that chemotherapeutic agents release serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine by causing degenerative changes in the GI tract [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161]. The serotonin then stimulates the vagal and splanchnic nerve receptors that project to the medullary vomiting center, as well as the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors in the area postrema, thus initiating the vomiting reflex, causing nausea and vomiting [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161].



Moreover, the effect of ondansetron on the QTc interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo and positive (moxifloxacin) controlled, crossover study in 58 healthy adult men and women [F3181, F3184]. Ondansetron was tested at single doses of 8 mg and 32 mg infused intravenously over 15 minutes [F3181, F3184]. At the highest tested dose of 32 mg, prolongation of the Fridericia-corrected QTc interval (QT/RR0.33=QTcF) was observed from 15 min to 4 h after the start of the 15 min infusion, with a maximum mean (upper limit of 90% CI) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline-correction of 19.6 (21.5) msec at 20 min [F3181, F3184]. At the lower tested dose of 8 mg, QTc prolongation was observed from 15 min to 1 h after the start of the 15-minute infusion, with a maximum mean (upper limit of 90% CI) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline-correction of 5.8 (7.8) msec at 15 min [F3181, F3184]. The magnitude of QTc prolongation with ondansetron is expected to be greater if the infusion rate is faster than 15 minutes [F3181, F3184]. The 32 mg intravenous dose of ondansetron must not be administered [F3181, F3184]. No treatment-related effects on the QRS duration or the PR interval were observed at either the 8 or 32 mg dose [F3181, F3184].



An ECG assessment study has not been performed for orally administered ondansetron [F3181, F3184]. On the basis of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling, an 8 mg oral dose of ondansetron is predicted to cause a mean QTcF increase of 0.7 ms (90% CI -2.1, 3.3) at steady-state, assuming a mean maximal plasma concentration of 24.7 ng/mL (95% CI 21.1, 29.0) [F3181, F3184]. The magnitude of QTc prolongation at the recommended 5 mg/m2 dose in pediatrics has not been studied, but pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling predicts a mean increase of 6.6 ms (90% CI 2.8, 10.7) at maximal plasma concentrations [F3181, F3184]. 



In healthy subjects, single intravenous doses of 0.15 mg/kg of ondansetron had no effect on esophageal motility, gastric motility, lower esophageal sphincter pressure, or small intestinal transit time [F3178]. Multiday administration of ondansetron has been shown to slow colonic transit in healthy subjects [F3178]. Ondansetron has no effect on plasma prolactin concentrations [F3178].', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Moreover, there have also been studies demonstrating the capacity for lactulose to minimize the formation of gallstones and even some investigations regarding the experimental use of the agent in developing novel anticancer agents owing to its ability to bind galactin carbohydrates involved in various tumor progressions [L6202].', 'Lactulose is a synthetic disaccharide derivative of lactose that consists of one molecule of galactose and one molecule of fructose.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] Saccharolytic bacteria present in the large intestine subsequently break the substance down into organic acids like lactic acid and small amounts of formic and acetic acids.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] Such resultant volatile fatty acid metabolites, in combination with hydrogen and methane that is also generated consequently enhance intraluminal gas formation, peristaltic gut motility, and elicit an osmotic effect that facilitates an increase in the water content of stool as well as associated stool softening.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] All of these actions ultimately assist in facilitating and increasing the frequency of bowel movements in patients experiencing constipation, although it may take 24 to 48 hours after using the medication for this laxative effect to become evident.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]



At the same time, the formation of such acids via the metabolism of lactulose by colonic bacteria also acidifies the contents of the colon, thereby contributing to the treatment of portal-systemic encephalopathy (PSE).[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] As one of the principal features of PSE involves the accumulation of nitrogenous waste products like ammonia in the systemic circulation, a state in which the colonic contents become more acidic than blood allows ammonia in the circulation to diffuse into the colon.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]. Furthermore, ammonia that diffuses into the acidic colon is ionized to ammonium ions that are incapable of being absorbed back into the blood.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] These effects, combined with the laxative action of lactulose facilitates the excretion of excess ammonia.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] And finally, it is also believed that an acidic colonic environment results in the elimination of urease-producing bacteria that contribute to the formation of ammonia while surviving colonic bacteria use up any trapped ammonia in the colon as a source of nitrogen for protein synthesis.[L6202]', 'Lactulose formulations are most commonly administered via the oral route or the rectal route.[L6202] Consequently, because the substance experiences minimal absorption by the gut it typically remains localized in the gastrointestinal tract environment and ultimately demonstrates almost all of its pharmacologic effects within the gut.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] In particular, as lactulose elicits its laxative effects in enhancing stool amounts and softening stool, such biochemical and physiologic activities can cause increased bowel sounds (borborygmi), a feeling of bloatedness, belching, frequent flatus, and diarrhea.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]   ', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Clinical studies have shown amikacin sulfate injection to be effective in bacterial septicemia (including neonatal sepsis); in serious infections of the respiratory tract, bones and joints, central nervous system (including meningitis) and skin and soft tissue; intra-abdominal infections (including peritonitis); and in burns and postoperative infections (including post-vascular surgery).[F1954]



Clinical studies have shown amikacin also to be effective in serious, complicated, and recurrent urinary tract infections due to the above organisms.

**Important notes regarding Staphylococcus and Sensitivity testing:**



Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains, is the principal Gram-positive organism sensitive to amikacin.

The use of amikacin in the treatment of staphylococcal infections should be restricted only to second-line therapy, and should be limited to only those patients suffering from severe infections caused by susceptible strains of staphylococcus species who have failed to show sensitivity to other available antibiotics.[F1949]



Bacteriologic studies should be performed to identify causative organisms and their susceptibilities to amikacin. Amikacin may be used as initial therapy in suspected gram-negative infections and therapy may be initiated before obtaining the results of susceptibility testing.[Label,F1949,F1954]', 'The primary mechanism of action of amikacin is the same as that for all aminoglycosides. It binds to bacterial 30S ribosomal subunits and interferes with mRNA binding and tRNA acceptor sites, interfering with bacterial growth. This leads to disruption of normal protein synthesis and production of non-functional or toxic peptides. Other actions have been postulated for drugs of this class.[Label,F1949,F1950] Amikacin, as well as the rest of the aminoglycosides, are generally bacteriocidal against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.[L4680,F1954]', 'Amikacin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic.

Such interaction has been reported in a study that investigated the effects of neuronal outgrowth induced by beta amyloid peptides; while amyloid peptides cause lipid disorganization within the cell membranes leading to neuronal death, piracetam demonstrated to decrease the destabilizing effects of amyloid peptide [A31534]. The authors suggest that piracetam induces a positive curvature of the membrane by occupying the polar groups in the phospholipids to counteract the negative curvature induced by amyloid peptides , which in turn would decrease the likelihood of membrane fusion [A31532]. This mechanism of action is thought to improve membrane stability, allowing the membrane and transmembrane proteins to maintain and recover the three-dimensional structure or folding for normal function [L1124] such as membrane transport, chemical secretion, and receptor binding and stimulation [A31532]. 



Through restored membrane fluidity, piracetam promotes restored neurotransmission such as glutamatergic and cholinergic systems, enhances neuroplasticity and mediates neuroprotective and anticonvulsant effects at the neuronal level [A31532]. It is also demonstrated that piracetam also improves the fluidity of platelet membranes. At the vascular level, piracetam decreases adhesion of erythrocytes to cell wall and reduces vasospasm which in turn improves microcirculation including cerebral and renal blood flow [A31532]. ', 'Piracetam is known to mediate various pharmacodynamic actions:



**Neuronal effects**: 



Piracetam modulates the cholinergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic, and glutamatergic neurotransmission although the drug does not display high affinity to any of the associated receptors (Ki >10μM). Instead, piracetam increases the density of postsynaptic receptors and/or restore the function of these receptors through stabilizing the membrane fluidity [A31532]. In the forebrain of aging mice, the density of NMDA receptors was increased by approximately 20% following 14 days of piracetam treatment. Based on the findings of various animal and human studies, the cognitive processses including learning, memory, attention and consciousness were enhanced from piracetam therapy without inducing sedation and psychostimulant effects [L1125]. Piracetam mediate neuroprotective effects against hypoxia-induced damage, intoxication, and electroconvulsive therapy [L1125]. 



In two studies involving alcohol-treated rats with evidences of withdrawal-related neuronal loss, piracetam was shown to reduce the extent of neuronal loss and increase the numbers of synapses in the hippocampus by up to 20% relative to alcohol-treated or alcohol-withdrawn rats [A31532]. This suggests that piracetam is capable in promoting neuroplasticity when recoverable neural circuits are present [A31532]. Although the mechanism of action is not fully understood, administration of piracetam prior to a convulsant stimulus reduces the seizure severity and enhances the anticonvulsant effectiveness of conventional antiepileptics such as carbamazepine and diazepam [A31535]. 



**Vascular effects**: 



Piracetam is shown to increase the deformability of erythrocytes, reduce platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent manner, reduce the adhesion of erythrocytes to vascular endothelium and capillary vasospasm. In healthy volunteers, piracetam mediated a direct stimulant effect on prostacycline synthesis and reduced the plasma levels of fibrinogen and von Willebrand’s factors (VIII: C; VIII R: AG; VIII R: vW) by 30 to 40% [L1125].

Whereas drugs like colchicine cause the depolymerization of microtubules in vivo, paclitaxel arrests their function by having the opposite effect; it hyper-stabilizes their structure. This destroys the cell''s ability to use its cytoskeleton in a flexible manner. Specifically, paclitaxel binds to the &beta; subunit of tubulin. Tubulin is the "building block" of mictotubules, and the binding of paclitaxel locks these building blocks in place. The resulting microtubule/paclitaxel complex does not have the ability to disassemble. This adversely affects cell function because the shortening and lengthening of microtubules (termed dynamic instability) is necessary for their function as a transportation highway for the cell. Chromosomes, for example, rely upon this property of microtubules during mitosis. Further research has indicated that paclitaxel induces programmed cell death (apoptosis) in cancer cells by binding to an apoptosis stopping protein called Bcl-2 (B-cell leukemia 2) and thus arresting its function.', 'Paclitaxel is a taxoid antineoplastic agent indicated as first-line and subsequent therapy for the treatment of advanced carcinoma of the ovary, and other various cancers including breast cancer.

Impairment of thymidylate synthesis in patients with folic acid deficiency is thought to account for the defective deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis that leads to megaloblast formation and megaloblastic and macrocytic anemias. Folic acid is particularly important during phases of rapid cell division, such as infancy, pregnancy, and erythropoiesis, and plays a protective factor in the development of cancer. As humans are unable to synthesize folic acid endogenously, diet and supplementation is necessary to prevent deficiencies. In order to function properly within the body, folic acid must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted by anti-metabolite therapies such as [DB00563] as they function as DHFR inhibitors to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, and therefore prevent the formation of DHF and THF.

Hyperuricemia is closely related to gout, whereby it may exist for many years before the first clinical attack of gout; thus, aberrated serum uric acid levels and hyperuricemia are believed to be the biochemical aberration involved in the pathogenesis of gout.[A230548] Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) can act as a xanthine oxidase or xanthine dehydrogenase. In humans, it is a critical enzyme for uric acid production as it catalyzes the oxidation reaction steps from hypoxanthine to xanthine and from xanthine to uric acid in the pathway of purine metabolism.[A19658] Febuxostat potently inhibits XOR, blocking both its oxidase and dehydrogenase activities. With high affinity, febuxostat binds to XOR in a molecular channel leading to the molybdenum-pterin active site, where [allopurinol] demonstrates relatively weak competitive inhibition.[A230548] 



XOR is mainly found in the dehydrogenase form under normal physiological conditions; however, in inflammatory conditions, XOR can be converted into the xanthine oxidase form, which catalyzes reactions that produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as peroxynitrite. ROS contribute to vascular inflammation and alterations in vascular function. As febuxostat can inhibit both forms of XOR, it can inhibit ROS formation, oxidative stress, and inflammation.[A2743] In a rat model, febuxostat suppressed renal ischemia-reperfusion injury by attenuating oxidative stress.[A2744]', 'Febuxostat is a novel, selective xanthine oxidase/dehydrogenase inhibitor that works by decreasing serum uric acid in a dose-dependent manner.

PGE<sub>2</sub> is the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.[A179023] It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.[T116,A179023] PGE<sub>2</sub> activates the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled EP<sub>1</sub> receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE<sub>2</sub> also activates the EP<sub>4</sub> receptor, coupled to G<sub>s</sub>, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE<sub>2</sub> act via EP<sub>3</sub> to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP<sub>2</sub> to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI<sub>2</sub> is known to play a role via its G<sub>s</sub>-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.



PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP<sub>2</sub> receptors.[T116,A179044] Similarly to β adrenergic receptors these are G<sub>s</sub>-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE<sub>2</sub> also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.[T116] PGD<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP<sub>1</sub> receptor.[A179044] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.



PGE<sub>2</sub> can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory G<sub>q</sub> EP<sub>3</sub> receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.[T116] This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever. NSAIDs prevent the generation of PGE<sub>2</sub> thereby reducing the activity of these neurons.

Therapeutic efforts directed toward the control of hyperphosphatemia include reduction in the dietary intake of phosphate, inhibition of absorption of phosphate in the intestine with phosphate binders, and removal of phosphate from the body by more efficient methods of dialysis. The rate of removal of phosphate by dietary manipulation or by dialysis is insufficient. Dialysis patients absorb 40% to 80% of dietary phosphorus.

These folic acid congeners are transported across cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis where they are needed to maintain normal erythropoiesis, synthesize purine and thymidylate nucleic acids, interconvert amino acids, methylate tRNA, and generate and use formate. Using vitamin B12 as a cofactor, folic acid can normalize high homocysteine levels by remethylation of homocysteine to methionine via methionine synthetase.', 'Folic acid is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin found in foods such as liver, kidney, yeast, and leafy, green vegetables. Also known as folate or Vitamin B9, folic acid is an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in DNA and RNA synthesis. More specifically, folic acid is required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. Folic acid is the precursor of tetrahydrofolic acid, which is involved as a cofactor for transformylation reactions in the biosynthesis of purines and thymidylates of nucleic acids. Impairment of thymidylate synthesis in patients with folic acid deficiency is thought to account for the defective deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis that leads to megaloblast formation and megaloblastic and macrocytic anemias. Folic acid is particularly important during phases of rapid cell division, such as infancy, pregnancy, and erythropoiesis, and plays a protective factor in the development of cancer. As humans are unable to synthesize folic acid endogenously, diet and supplementation is necessary to prevent deficiencies. In order to function properly within the body, folic acid must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted by anti-metabolite therapies such as [DB00563] as they function as DHFR inhibitors to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, and therefore prevent the formation of DHF and THF.

As neutrophils promote both the initiation and the maintenance of inflammation at sites of infection, suppressed neutrophil responses lead to extreme susceptibility to infection.[A35605] Low neutrophil levels, or neutropenia, caused by chronic neutropenia, myelosuppressive chemotherapy, and radiation therapy increases the risk of infection and related events.[A245868] Neutropenia caused by chemotherapy or radiation therapy can further progress into febrile neutropenia, which is associated with an elevated risk for life-threatening systemic infections and chemotherapy-associated morbidity and mortality.[A35591]



The production and release of functional neutrophils from the bone marrow are normally regulated by granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF), which are major cytokine regulators of neutrophilic granulocytes.[A35605] G-CSFs act on hematopoietic cells by binding to specific cell surface receptors to stimulate the proliferation‚ differentiation‚ and maturation of neutrophil progenitors.

PGE<sub>2</sub> is the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.[A179023] It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.[T116,A179023] PGE<sub>2</sub> activates the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled EP<sub>1</sub> receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE<sub>2</sub> also activates the EP<sub>4</sub> receptor, coupled to G<sub>s</sub>, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE<sub>2</sub> act via EP<sub>3</sub> to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP<sub>2</sub> to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI<sub>2</sub> is known to play a role via its G<sub>s</sub>-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.



PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP<sub>2</sub> receptors.[T116,A179044] Similarly to β adrenergic receptors these are G<sub>s</sub>-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE<sub>2</sub> also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.[T116] PGD<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP<sub>1</sub> receptor.[A179044] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.



PGE<sub>2</sub> can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory G<sub>q</sub> EP<sub>3</sub> receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.[T116] This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever. NSAIDs prevent the generation of PGE<sub>2</sub> thereby reducing the activity of these neurons.

', '**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].



Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].



In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].



There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].



Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].



The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. 



In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].



In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].



The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].', 'Zinc is involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of human proteins may bind zinc, in addition to hundreds of proteins that transport and traffic zinc. It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is an essential element for a proper sense of taste and smell and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations [L2211].



Studies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions [L2095]:



**Colds:** Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently [L2095].



**Wound healing:** Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements [L2095]. 



**Diahrrea**: Oral zinc supplements can reduce the symptoms of diarrhea in children with low levels of zinc, especially in cases of malnutrition [L2095].

A multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluated the efficacy of glimepiride (1–8 mg) as monotherapy titrated over 10 weeks compared with placebo in T2DM subjects who were not controlled by diet alone.[A177703] In this study, there was a reduction in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) by 46 mg/dL, post-prandial glucose (PPG) by 72 mg/dL, and HbA1c by 1.4% more than the placebo.[A177703] In another randomized study comprising of patients with T2DM receiving either placebo or one of the three doses (1, 4, or 8 mg) of glimepiride during a 14-week study period, all glimepiride regimens significantly reduced FPG, PPG, and HbA1c values (P < 0.001) compared to placebo by the end of the study period.[A177703] The 4- and 8-mg doses of glimepiride were more effective than the 1-mg dose; however, the 4-mg dose provided a nearly maximal antihyperglycemic effect.[A177703]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

The Health Canada monograph for rosuvastatin further specifies that rosuvastatin is indicated for the reduction of elevated total cholesterol (Total-C), LDL-C, ApoB, the Total-C/HDL-C ratio and triglycerides (TG) and for increasing HDL-C in hyperlipidemic and dyslipidemic conditions when response to diet and exercise alone has been inadequate. It is also indicated for the prevention of major cardiovascular events (including risk of myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and coronary artery revascularization) in adult patients without documented history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events, but with at least two conventional risk factors for cardiovascular disease.[F4652]



Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]', 'Rosuvastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A181421] Rosuvastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which increases hepatic uptake of LDL. Rosuvastatin also inhibits hepatic synthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL).[F4649] The overall effect is a decrease in plasma LDL and VLDL. 



In vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that rosuvastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] This includes improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response.



Statins have also been found to bind allosterically to β2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and in T cell activation.[A181559]



Rosuvastatin exerts an anti-inflammatory effect on rat mesenteric microvascular endothelium by attenuating leukocyte rolling, adherence and transmigration.[A1807] The drug also modulates nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression and reduces ischemic-reperfusion injuries in rat hearts.[A1787] Rosuvastatin increases the bioavailability of nitric oxide[A1807,A1799,A1787] by upregulating NOS[A1791] and by increasing the stability of NOS through post-transcriptional polyadenylation.[A1796] It is unclear as to how rosuvastatin brings about these effects though they may be due to decreased concentrations of mevalonic acid.', 'Rosuvastatin is a synthetic, enantiomerically pure antilipemic agent. It is used to lower total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and trigleride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, rosuvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A181087, A181406]



Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]



**Skeletal Muscle Effects**



Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. These risks can occur at any dose level, but are increased at the highest dose (40 mg). Rosuvastatin should be prescribed with caution in patients with predisposing factors for myopathy (e.g., age ≥ 65 years, inadequately treated hypothyroidism, renal impairment).



The risk of myopathy during treatment with rosuvastatin may be increased with concurrent administration of some other lipid-lowering therapies (such as [fenofibrate] or [niacin]), [gemfibrozil], [cyclosporine], [atazanavir]/[ritonavir], [lopinavir]/ritonavir, or [simeprevir].  Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin, coadministered with [colchicine], and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together.[F4649] 



Real-world data from observational studies has suggested that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]



**Liver Enzyme Abnormalities**



Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. In most cases, the elevations were transient and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. There were two cases of jaundice, for which a relationship to rosuvastatin therapy could not be determined, which resolved after discontinuation of therapy. There were no cases of liver failure or irreversible liver disease in these trials.[F4649]



**Endocrine Effects**



Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin calcium tablets. Based on clinical trial data with rosuvastatin, in some instances these increases may exceed the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.[F4649]



An in vitro study found that [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], and [pitavastatin] exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on human pancreas islet β cells, with reductions in cell viability of 32, 41, 34 and 29%, respectively, versus control]. Moreover, insulin secretion rates were decreased by 34, 30, 27 and 19%, respectively, relative to control.[A182012]



HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and lower cholesterol levels and, as such, might theoretically blunt adrenal or gonadal steroid hormone production. Rosuvastatin demonstrated no effect upon nonstimulated cortisol levels and no effect on thyroid metabolism as assessed by TSH plasma concentration. In rosuvastatin treated patients, there was no impairment of adrenocortical reserve and no reduction in plasma cortisol concentrations. Clinical studies with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have suggested that these agents do not reduce plasma testosterone concentration. The effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on male fertility have not been studied. The effects, if any, on the pituitarygonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown.[F4652]



**Cardiovascular**



Ubiquinone levels were not measured in rosuvastatin clinical trials, however significant decreases in circulating ubiquinone levels in patients treated with other statins have been observed. The clinical significance of a potential long-term statin-induced deficiency of ubiquinone has not been established. It has been reported that a decrease in myocardial ubiquinone levels could lead to impaired cardiac function in patients with borderline congestive heart failure.[F4652]



**Lipoprotein A**



In some patients, the beneficial effect of lowered total cholesterol and LDL-C levels may be partly blunted by a concomitant increase in the Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentrations. Present knowledge suggests the importance of high Lp(a) levels as an emerging risk factor for coronary heart disease. It is thus desirable to maintain and reinforce lifestyle changes in high-risk patients placed on rosuvastatin therapy.[F4652] Further studies have demonstrated statins affect Lp(a) levels differently in patients with dyslipidemia depending on their apo(a) phenotype; statins increase Lp(a) levels exclusively in patients with the low molecular weight apo(a) phenotype.[A181418]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

It is a very common over-the-counter medication widely used as an analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic.[A39096]



The use of ibuprofen and its enantiomer [DB09213] in a racemic mix is common for the management of mild to moderate pain related to dysmenorrhea, headache, migraine, postoperative dental pain, spondylitis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and soft tissue disorder.[A39097]



Due to its activity against prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis, ibuprofen has been attributed to alteration of platelet function and prolongation of gestation and labour.[A39092]



As ibuprofen is a widely used medication, the main therapeutic indications are:



* Patent Ductus Arteriosus - it is a neonatal condition wherein the ductus arteriosus (blood vessel that connects the main pulmonary artery to the proximal descending aorta) fails to close after birth causing severe risk of heart failure. The prostaglandin inhibition of ibuprofen has been studied for the treatment of this condition as it is known that prostaglandin E2 is responsible for keeping the ductus arteriosus open.[A39100]



* Rheumatoid- and osteo-arthritis - ibuprofen is very commonly used in the symptomatic treatment of inflammatory, musculoskeletal and rheumatic disorders.[A39176]



* Cystic fibrosis - the use of high dosages of ibuprofen has been proven to decrease inflammation and decreasing polymorphonuclear cell influx in the lungs.[A39177]



* Orthostatic hypotension - ibuprofen can induce sodium retention and antagonize the effect of diuretics which has been reported to be beneficial for patients with severe orthostatic hypotension.[A1651]



* Dental pain - ibuprofen is used to manage acute and chronic orofacial pain.[A10901]



* Pain - ibuprofen is widely used to reduce minor aches and pains as well as to reduce fever and manage dysmenorrhea. It is very commonly used for the relief of acute indications such as fever and tension headaches.[A39092] It is also used to manage mild to moderate pain and moderate to severe pain as an adjunct to opioid analgesics.[L40208]



* Investigational uses - efforts have been put into developing ibuprofen for the prophylaxis of Alzheimer''s disease, Parkinson disease, and breast cancer.[A39092]', 'The exact mechanism of action of ibuprofen is unknown. However, ibuprofen is considered an NSAID and thus it is a non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, which is an enzyme involved in prostaglandin (mediators of pain and fever) and thromboxane (stimulators of blood clotting) synthesis via the arachidonic acid pathway.[L4614]



Ibuprofen is a non-selective COX inhibitor and hence, it inhibits the activity of both COX-1 and COX-2. The inhibition of COX-2 activity decreases the synthesis of prostaglandins involved in mediating inflammation, pain, fever, and swelling while the inhibition of COX-1 is thought to cause some of the side effects of ibuprofen including GI ulceration.[A39195]', 'Ibuprofen has multiple actions in different inflammatory pathways involved in acute and chronic inflammation. The main effects reported in ibuprofen are related to the control of pain, fever and acute inflammation by the inhibition of the synthesis of prostanoids by COX-1 and COX-2. Pain relief is attributed to peripheral affected regions and central nervous system effects in the pain transmission mediated by the dorsal horn and higher spinothalamic tract. Some reports have tried to link the pain regulation with a possible enhancement on the synthesis of endogenous cannabinoids and action on the NMDA receptors. The effect on pain has been shown to be related to the cortically evoked potentials.[A39190]



The antipyretic effect is reported to be linked to the effect on the prostanoid synthesis due to the fact that the prostanoids are the main signaling mediator of pyresis in the hypothalamic-preoptic region.[A39190]



The use of ibuprofen in dental procedures is attributed to the local inhibition of prostanoid production as well as to anti-oedemic activity and an increase of plasma beta-endorphins. Some reports have suggested a rapid local reduction of the expression of COX-2 in dental pulp derived by the administration of ibuprofen.[A39190]



The administration of ibuprofen in patients with rheumatic diseases has shown to control joint symptoms.[A39092] 



Ibuprofen is largely used in OTC products such as an agent for the management of dysmenorrhea which has been proven to reduce the amount of menstrual prostanoids and to produce a reduction in the uterine hypercontractility.[A39181] As well, it has been reported to reduce significantly the fever and the pain caused by migraines.[A39182, A39183] This effect is thought to be related to the effect on platelet activation and thromboxane A2 production which produces local vascular effects in the affected regions. This effect is viable as ibuprofen can enter in the central nervous system.[A39190]



In the investigational uses of ibuprofen, it has been reported to reduce neurodegeneration when given in low doses over a long time.[A39184] On the other hand, its use in Parkinson disease is related to the importance of inflammation and oxidative stress in the pathology of this condition.[A39185] The use of ibuprofen for breast cancer is related to a study that shows a decrease of 50% in the rate of breast cancer.[A39186]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Vestibular forms of vertigo are often accompanied by auditory dysfunctions such as hyperacusis, hearing loss, and tinnitus.[A220328] In most cases, adaptive mechanisms of the CNS lead to functional recovery after episodes of vertigo, however, syndromes such as Ménière''s disease tend to cause the recurrence of vertigo symptoms. This significantly impacts the quality of life and the ability to carry out daily activities.[A220318] 



**H1-receptor activity**



The mechanism of action of betahistine is multifactorial. Ménière''s disease is thought to result from a disruption of endolymphatic fluid homeostasis in the ear.[A220438] Betahistine mainly acts as a histamine H1-receptor agonist. The stimulation of H1-receptors in the inner ear causes a vasodilatory effect leading to increased permeability of blood vessels and a reduction in endolymphatic pressure; this action prevents the rupture of the labyrinth, which can contribute to the hearing loss associated with  Ménière''s disease. Betahistine is also purported to act by reducing the asymmetrical functioning of sensory vestibular organs and increasing vestibulocochlear blood flow, relieving symptoms of vertigo.[A220433]



**H3-receptor activity**



In addition to the above mechanisms, betahistine also acts as a histamine H3-receptor antagonist, increasing the turnover of histamine from postsynaptic histaminergic nerve receptors, subsequently leading to an increase in H1-agonist activity. H3-receptor antagonism elevates levels of neurotransmitters including serotonin in the brainstem, inhibiting the activity of vestibular nuclei, thus restoring proper balance and decreasing vertigo symptoms.[A220328]', 'Through its actions on the histamine receptors, betahistine provides relief from vertigo associated with Ménière''s disease.[A220328,A220433,L16388] ', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Animal research studies have demonstrated that carbamazepine exerts its effects by lowering polysynaptic nerve response and inhibiting post-tetanic potentiation. In both cats and rats, carbamazepine was shown to decrease pain caused by infraorbital nerve stimulation. A decrease in the action potential in the nucleus ventralis of the thalamus in the brain and inhibition of the lingual mandibular reflex were observed in other studies after carbamazepine use. Carbamazepine causes the above effects by binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels and preventing action potentials, which normally lead to stimulatory effects on nerves.[A180403,T634] In bipolar disorder, carbamazepine is thought to increase dopamine turnover and increase GABA transmission, treating manic and depressive symptoms.[L7216]



A common issue that has arisen is resistance to this drug in up to 30% of epileptic patients, which may occur to altered metabolism in patients with variant genotypes.[A180436] A potential therapeutic target to combat carbamazepine resistance has recently been identified as the EPHX1 gene promoter, potentially conferring resistance to carbamazepine through methylation.[A180439]', '**General effects**

This inhibits the AT1-mediated vasoconstrictive and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II and results in an overall decrease in blood pressure. Candesartan is greater than 10,000 times more selective for AT1 than AT2. Inhibition of aldosterone secretion may increase sodium and water excretion while decreasing potassium excretion.', 'Candesartan cilexetil is an ARB prodrug that is rapidly converted to candesartan, its active metabolite, during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Candesartan confers blood pressure lowering effects by antagonizing the hypertensive effects of angiotensin II via the RAAS. RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. Renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is cleaved by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II increases blood pressure by increasing total peripheral resistance, increasing sodium and water reabsorption in the kidneys via aldosterone secretion, and altering cardiovascular structure. Angiotensin II binds to two receptors: type-1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1) and type-2 angiotensin II receptor (AT2). AT1 is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that mediates the vasoconstrictive and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II. Studies performed in recent years suggest that AT2 antagonizes AT1-mediated effects and directly affects long-term blood pressure control by inducing vasorelaxation and increasing urinary sodium excretion. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are non-peptide competitive inhibitors of AT1. ARBs block the ability of angiotensin II to stimulate pressor and cell proliferative effects.

This increase in calcium and phosphorus levels occurs within three days following drug administration: this effect was reversed within three days of drug discontinuation. In patients with chronic renal failure, serum calcium levels were elevated while parathyroid hormone and alkaline phosphatase levels returned to normal levels within five days following alfacalcidol administration.[L33369] Since alfacalcidol suppresses parathyroid hormone, a reduction in parathyroid hormone levels is achieved more rapidly in patients on intermittent intravenous therapy, with significant reductions occurring within three months of therapy. In patients receiving daily oral therapy of alfacalcidol, the time it takes alfacalcidol to normalize plasma calcium levels may be up to several months, possibly reflecting calcium being utilized for bone mineralization.[L33284] In patients with nutritional osteomalacia, alfacalcidol increased calcium absorption with six hours of oral administration and the effects peaked at 24 hours.[L33369]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

When used in combination with [naltrexone] as the marketed product ContraveⓇ, bupropion is indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adults with an initial body mass index (BMI) of: 30 kg/m^2 or greater (obese) or 27 kg/m^2 or greater (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition (e.g., hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or dyslipidemia).



Bupropion is also used off-label as a first-line treatment in patients with ADHD and comorbid bipolar disorder when used as an adjunct to mood stabilizers.[F4624]', 'Bupropion is a norepinephrine/dopamine-reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) that exerts its pharmacological effects by weakly inhibiting the enzymes involved in the uptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine from the synaptic cleft, therefore prolonging their duration of action within the neuronal synapse and the downstream effects of these neurotransmitters. More specifically, bupropion binds to the norepinephrine transporter (NET) and the dopamine transporter (DAT).[A6399,A178810] 



Bupropion was originally classified as an "atypical" antidepressant because it does not exert the same effects as the classical antidepressants such as Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs), Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs), or Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs). While it has comparable effectiveness to typical first-line options for the treatment of depression such as SSRIs,[A178798,A178804] bupropion is a unique option for the treatment of MDD as it lacks any clinically relevant serotonergic effects, typical of other mood medications, or any effects on histamine or adrenaline receptors.[A6399,A178840] Lack of activity at these receptors results in a more tolerable side effect profile; bupropion is less likely to cause sexual side effects, sedation, or weight gain as compared to SSRIs or TCAs, for example.[A178804,A178807]



When used as an aid to smoking cessation, bupropion is thought to confer its anti-craving and anti-withdrawal effects by inhibiting dopamine reuptake, which is thought to be involved in the reward pathways associated with nicotine, and through the antagonism of the nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptor (AChR), thereby blunting the effects of nicotine.[A178825,A1966,A16508] Furthermore, the stimulatory effects produced by bupropion in the central nervous system are similar to nicotine''s effects, making low doses of bupropion a suitable option as a nicotine substitute.[A179062]  



When used in combination with [naltrexone] in the marketed product ContraveⓇ for chronic weight management, the two components are thought to have effects on areas of the brain involved in the regulation of food intake. This includes the hypothalamus, which is involved in appetite regulation, and the mesolimbic dopamine circuit, which is involved in reward pathways.[L6562] Studies have shown that the combined activity of bupropion and [naltrexone] increase the firing rate of hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons and blockade of opioid receptor-mediated POMC auto-inhibition, which are associated with a reduction in food intake and increased energy expenditure.[L6562,A179038,A179050] This combination was also found to reduce food intake when injected directly into the ventral tegmental area of the mesolimbic circuit in mice, which is an area associated with the regulation of reward pathways.[L6562]', 'Bupropion is chemically unrelated to tricyclic, tetracyclic, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, or other known antidepressant agents. Compared to classical tricyclic antidepressants, Bupropion is a relatively weak inhibitor of the neuronal uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine. In addition, Bupropion does not inhibit monoamine oxidase. Bupropion has been found to be essentially inactive at the serotonin transporter (SERT)(IC50 >10 000 nM),[A178810] however both bupropion and its primary metabolite hydroxybupropion have been found to block the function of cation-selective serotonin type 3A receptors (5-HT3ARs). 



Bupropion produces dose-related central nervous system (CNS) stimulant effects in animals, as evidenced by increased locomotor activity, increased rates of responding in various schedule-controlled operant behaviour tasks, and, at high doses, induction of mild stereotyped behaviour [FDA Label]. Due to these stimulant effects and selective activity at dopamine and norepinephrine receptors, bupropion has been identified as having an abuse potential.[FDA Label,A178846] Bupropion has a similar structure to the controlled substance [DB01560], and has been identified as having mild amphetamine-like activity, particularly when inhaled or injected.[A178846]



Bupropion is also known to lower the seizure threshold, making any pre-existing seizure conditions a contraindication to its use. This risk is exacerbated when bupropion is combined with other drugs or substances that lower the seizure threshold, such as [cocaine], or in clinical situations that would increase the risk of a seizure such as abrupt alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal.[FDA Label] As norepinephrine has been shown to have anticonvulsant properties, bupropion''s inhibitory effects on NET are thought to contribute to its pro-convulsant activity.[A178846]



Bupropion has been shown to increase blood pressure and pose a risk for exacerbation of unmanaged or pre-existing hypertension,[A178852,FDA Label] however, clinical trials of bupropion in smokers with CVD have not identified an increased incidence of CV events including stroke or heart attack.[A178855] In clinical trials, the mean increase in systolic blood pressure associated with the use of bupropion was found to be 1.3 mmHg.[FDA Label]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Intravenous indometacin is indicated to induce closure of a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants weighing between 500 and 1750 g when after 48 hours usual medical management (e.g., fluid restriction, diuretics, digitalis, respiratory support, etc.) is ineffective.[L10553]', 'Indometacin is a nonspecific and reversible inhibitor of the cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzyme or prostaglandin G/H synthase. There are two identified isoforms of COX: COX-1 is universally present in most body tissues and is involved in the synthesis of the prostaglandins and thromboxane A2, while COX-2 is expressed in response to injury or inflammation.[A177871] Constitutively expressed, the COX-1 enzyme is involved in gastric mucosal protection, platelet, and kidney function by catalyzing the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin (PG) G2 and PGG2 to PGH2.[A177871] COX-2 is constitutively expressed and highly inducible by inflammatory stimuli. It is found in the central nervous system, kidneys, uterus, and other organs. COX-2 also catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to PGG2 and PGG2 to PGH2. In the COX-2-mediated pathway, PGH2 is further converted to PGE2 and PGI2 (also known as prostacyclin). PGE2 is involved in mediating inflammation, pain, and fever. Decreasing levels of PGE2 leads to reduced inflammatory reactions. Indometacin is known to inhibit both isoforms of COX, however, with greater selectivity for COX-1, which accounts for its increased adverse gastric effects relative to other NSAIDs. It binds to the enzyme''s active site and prevents the interaction between the enzyme and its substrate, arachidonic acid. Indometacin, unlike other NSAIDs, also inhibits phospholipase A2, the enzyme responsible for releasing arachidonic acid from phospholipids. The analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects of indomethacin as well as adverse reactions associated with the drug occur as a result of decreased prostaglandin synthesis. Its antipyretic effects may be due to action on the hypothalamus, resulting in increased peripheral blood flow, vasodilation, and subsequent heat dissipation.



The exact mechanism of action of indometacin in inducing closure of a patent ductus arteriosus is not fully understood; however, it is thought to be through inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.[L6778] At birth, the ductus arteriosus is normally closed as the tension of the oxygen increases significantly after birth.[A177880] Patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants is associated with congenital heart malformations where PGE1 mediates an opposite effect to that of oxygen. PGE1 dilates the ductus arteriosus through smooth muscle relaxation and prevents the closure of the ductus arteriosus.[A177880] By inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins, indometacin promotes the closure of ductus arteriosus.[L10553]



Indometacin has been described as possessing anticancer and antiviral properties through activation of protein kinase R (PKR) and downstream phosphorylation of eIF2α, inhibiting protein synthesis.[A234429, A234434]', 'Indometacin is an NSAID with analgesic and antipyretic properties that exerts its pharmacological effects by inhibiting the synthesis of factors involved in pain, fever, and inflammation. Its therapeutic action does not involve pituitary-adrenal stimulation.[L6778] Indometacin primarily works by suppressing inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis by providing relief of pain as well as reducing fever, swelling, and tenderness. This effectiveness has been demonstrated by a reduction in the extent of joint swelling, the average number of joints displaying symptoms of inflammation, and the severity of morning stiffness. Increased mobility was demonstrated by a decrease in total walking time and by improved functional capability seen as an increase in grip strength.[L6778] In clinical trials, indometacin was shown to be effective in relieving the pain, reducing the fever, swelling, redness, and tenderness of acute gouty arthritis. Due to its pharmacological actions, the use of indometacin is associated with the risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, as well as gastrointestinal effects such as bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines.[L6778]



In a study of healthy individuals, acute oral and intravenous indometacin therapy resulted in a transiently diminished basal and CO2 stimulated cerebral blood flow; this effect disappeared in one study after one week of oral treatment.[L6778] The clinical significance of this effect has not been established. Compared to other NSAIDs, it is suggested that indometacin is a more potent vasoconstrictor that is more consistent in decreasing cerebral blood flow and inhibiting CO2 reactivity.[A177871] There have been studies that show indometacin directly inhibiting neuronal activity to some extent in the trigeminocervical complex after either superior salivatory nucleus or dural stimulation.[A177871]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Off-label indications include atrial fibrillation and supraventricular tachycardia.[A189666,A189720,A189723,L11286]', 'Amiodarone is considered a class III anti-arrhythmic drug. It blocks potassium currents that cause repolarization of the heart muscle during the third phase of the cardiac action potential. As a result amiodarone increases the duration of the action potential as well as the effective refractory period for cardiac cells (myocytes). Therefore, cardiac muscle cell excitability is reduced, preventing and treating abnormal heart rhythms.[A183137,A189747]



Unique from other members of the class III anti-arrhythmic drug class, amiodarone also interferes with the functioning of beta-adrenergic receptors, sodium channels, and calcium channels channels. These actions, at times, can lead to undesirable effects, such as hypotension, bradycardia, and Torsades de pointes (TdP).[L11265] In addition to the above, amiodarone may increase activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, leading to steatogenic changes in the liver or other organs.[A20227,A20650] Finally, amiodarone has been found to bind to the thyroid receptor due to its iodine content, potentially leading to amiodarone induced hypothyroidism or thyrotoxicosis.[A182168]', 'After intravenous administration, amiodarone acts to relax smooth muscles that line vascular walls, decreases peripheral vascular resistance (afterload), and increases the cardiac index by a small amount. Administration by this route also decreases cardiac conduction, preventing and treating arrhythmias.[A1901,A189666,L3561] When it is given orally, however, amiodarone does not lead to significant changes in the left ventricular ejection fraction. Similar to other anti-arrhythmic agents, controlled clinical trials do not confirm that oral amiodarone increases survival.[L3561] 



Amiodarone prolongs the QRS duration and QT interval.  In addition, a decreased SA (sinoatrial) node automaticity occurs with a decrease in AV node conduction velocity.

The exact mechanism by which timolol reduces ocular pressure is unknown at this time, however, it likely decreases the secretion of aqueous humor in the eye.[L6730] According to one study, the reduction of aqueous humor secretion may occur through the decreased blood supply to the ciliary body resulting from interference with the active transport system or interference with prostaglandin biosynthesis.[A179515]', 'Timolol, when administered by the ophthalmic route, rapidly reduces intraocular pressure.

Resistance: viral genetic determinants resulting in variable response to ribavirin therapy has not been yet determined. ', 'Ribavirin is reported to have several mechanism of actions that lead to inhibition of viral RNA and protein synthesis. 

After activation by adenosine kinase to ribavirin mono-, di-, and triphosphate metabolites. Ribavirin triphosphate (RTP) is the predominant metabolite which directly inhibits viral mRNA polymerase by binding to the nucleotide binding site of the enzyme. This prevents the binding of the correct nucleotides, leading to a reduction in viral replication or to the production of defective virions [A19645]. RTP also demonstrates an inhibitory action on viral mRNA guanylyltransferase and mRNA 2′-O-methyltransferase of dengue virus. Inhibition of these enzymes disrupts the posttranslational capping of the 5′ end of viral mRNA through ribavirin being incorporated at the 5′ end in place of guanosine and preventing the cap methylation step. 



Inhibition of host inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and subsequent depletion of GTP pool is proposed to be another mechanism of action of ribavirin. IMPDH catalyzes the rate-limiting step where inosine 5′-monophosphate is converted to xanthine monophosphate during guanosine monophosphate (GMP) synthesis. GMP is later converted to guanosine triphoshpate (GTP). Ribavirin monophosphate mimics inosine 5′-monophosphate and acts as a competitive inhibitor of IMPDH. Inhibited de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides and decreased intracellular GTP pools leads to a decline in viral protein synthesis and limit replication of viral genomes [A19645].



Ribavirin acts as a mutagen in the target virus to cause an ''error catastrophe'' due to increased viral mutations. RTP pairs with cytidine triphosphate or uridine triphosphate with equal efficiency and to block HCV RNA elongation. It causes premature termination of nascent HCV RNA and increases mutagenesis by producing defective virions [A19645].



Ribavirin also exerts an immunomodulatory action of the host to the virus by shifting a Th2 response in favor of a Th1 phenotype. Th2 response and production of type 2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 stimulates the humoral response which enhances immunity toward the virus [A19645]. Ribavirin enhanced induction of interferon-related genes, including the interferon-α receptor, and down-regulation of genes involved in interferon inhibition, apoptosis, and hepatic stellate cell activation in vitro [A19644]. ', 'Ribavirin mediates direct antiviral activity against a number of DNA and RNA viruses by increasing the mutation frequency in the genomes of several RNA viruses.

Risperidone is additionally indicated in Canada for the short-term symptomatic management of aggression or psychotic symptoms in patients with severe dementia of the Alzheimer type unresponsive to nonpharmacological approaches.[L12906]



Risperidone is also used off-label for a number of conditions including as an adjunct to antidepressants in treatment-resistant depression.[A177226]', 'Though its precise mechanism of action is not fully understood, current focus is on the ability of risperidone to inhibit the D2 dopaminergic receptors and 5-HT2A serotonergic receptors in the brain. Schizophrenia is thought to result from an excess of dopaminergic D2 and serotonergic 5-HT2A activity, resulting in overactivity of central mesolimbic pathways and mesocortical pathways, respectively.[A1115, A1116, A1117]



D2 dopaminergic receptors are transiently inhibited by risperidone, reducing dopaminergic neurotransmission, therefore decreasing positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as delusions and hallucinations.[A251765] Risperidone binds transiently and with loose affinity to the dopaminergic D2 receptor, with an ideal receptor occupancy of 60-70% for optimal effect.[A1119,A31773] Rapid dissociation of risperidone from the D2 receptors contributes to decreased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), which occur with permanent and high occupancy blockade of D2 dopaminergic receptors.[A1118,A1119] Low-affinity binding and rapid dissociation from the D2 receptor distinguish risperidone from the traditional antipsychotic drugs. A higher occupancy rate of D2 receptors is said to increase the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms and is therefore to be avoided.[A1118,A1119,A31771] 

 

Increased serotonergic mesocortical activity in schizophrenia results in negative symptoms, such as depression and decreased motivation. The high-affinity binding of risperidone to 5-HT2A receptors leads to a decrease in serotonergic activity. In addition, 5-HT2A receptor blockade results in decreased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms, likely by increasing dopamine release from the frontal cortex, and not the nigrostriatal tract. Dopamine level is therefore not completely inhibited.[A1117,A1119] Through the above mechanisms, both serotonergic and D2 blockade by risperidone are thought to synergistically work to decrease the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms. 

 

Risperidone has also been said to be an antagonist of alpha-1 (α1), alpha-2 (α2), and histamine (H1) receptors.[A37034] Blockade of these receptors is thought to improve symptoms of schizophrenia, however the exact mechanism of action on these receptors is not fully understood at this time.[L12885]', 'The primary action of risperidone is to decrease dopaminergic and serotonergic pathway activity in the brain, therefore decreasing symptoms of schizophrenia and mood disorders.[A1115,A1116]



Risperidone has a high binding affinity for serotonergic 5-HT2A receptors when compared to dopaminergic D2 receptors in the brain.[A1114,A1115] Risperidone binds to D2 receptors with a lower affinity than first-generation antipsychotic drugs, which bind with very high affinity. A reduction in extrapyramidal symptoms with risperidone, when compared to its predecessors, is likely a result of its moderate affinity for dopaminergic D2 receptors.[A1119,A1117]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Lenalidomide exerts immunomodulating effects by altering cytokine production, regulating T cell co-stimulation, and enhancing the NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity.[A228543] Lenalidomide directly inhibits the cullin ring E3 ubiquitin ligase complex: upon binding to cereblon, a substrate adaptor of the complex, lenalidomide modulates substrate specificity of the complex to recruit substrate proteins of the ligase, including Ikaros (IKZF1), Aiolos (IKZF3), and CK1α.[L16028] These substrates are then tagged for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. IKZF1 and IKZF3 are B-cell transcription factors that are essential for B-cell differentiation and survival of malignant cells. IKZF3 also regulates the expression of interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), which is a transcription factor that regulates the aberrant myeloma-specific gene. The immunomodulatory actions of lenalidomide can be partly explained by the degradation of IKZF3, since it is a repressor of the interleukin 2 gene (IL2): as lenalidomide decreases the level of IKZF3, the production of IL-2 increases, thereby increasing the proliferation of natural killer (NK), NKT cells, and CD4+ T cells.[A228703] Lenalidomide inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-12, while elevating the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.[A228543] Lenalidomide acts as a T-cell co-stimulatory molecule that promotes CD3 T-cell proliferation and increases the production of IL-2 and IFN-γ in T lymphocytes, which enhances NK cell cytotoxicity and ADCC. It inhibits the expression and function of T-regulatory cells, which are often overabundant in some hematological malignancies.[A228708] 



Lenalidomide directly exerts antitumour effects by inhibiting the proliferation and inducing apoptosis of tumour cells. Lenalidomide triggers the activation of pro-apoptotic caspase-8, enhances tumour cell sensitivity to FAS-induced apoptosis, and downregulates NF-κB, an anti-apoptotic protein.[A228708] Independent of its immunomodulatory effects, lenalidomide mediates anti-angiogenic effects by inhibiting angiogenic growth factors released by tumour cells, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblastic-growth factor (BFGF), and hepatocyte-growth factor. _In vitro_, lenalidomide inhibits cell adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1, LFA-1, β2 and β3 integrins, as well as gap-junction function, thereby preventing metastasis of malignant cells.[A228708] ', 'In hematological malignancies, the immune system is deregulated in the form of altered cytokine networks in the tumour microenvironment, defective T cell regulation of host-tumour immune interactions, and diminished NK cell activity.[A228543] Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent with antineoplastic, antiangiogenic, and anti-inflammatory properties.[A228628] Lenalidomide exerts direct cytotoxicity by increasing apoptosis and inhibiting the proliferation of hematopoietic malignant cells.[A228708] It delays tumour growth in nonclinical hematopoietic tumour models _in vivo_, including multiple myeloma.[L16028] Lenalidomide also works to limit the invasion or metastasis of tumour cells and inhibits angiogenesis.[A228708]



Lenalidomide also mediates indirect antitumour effects via its immunomodulatory actions: it inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are implicated in various hematologic malignancies. Lenalidomide enhances the host immunity by stimulating T cell proliferation and enhancing the activity of natural killer (NK) cells.[A713, A228703, A228708] Lenalidomide is about 100–1000 times more potent in stimulating T cell proliferation than [thalidomide].[A228543] _In vitro_, it enhances antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), which is even more pronounced when used in combination with rituximab.[L16028] Due to its anti-inflammatory properties, lenalidomide has been investigated in the context of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[A229418] ', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

', '**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].



Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].



In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].



There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].



Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].



The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. 



In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].



In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].



The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].', 'Zinc is involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of human proteins may bind zinc, in addition to hundreds of proteins that transport and traffic zinc. It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is an essential element for a proper sense of taste and smell and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations [L2211].



Studies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions [L2095]:



**Colds:** Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently [L2095].



**Wound healing:** Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements [L2095]. 



**Diahrrea**: Oral zinc supplements can reduce the symptoms of diarrhea in children with low levels of zinc, especially in cases of malnutrition [L2095].

Ceftazidime is indicated in combination with [avibactam] to treat infections caused by susceptible Gram-negative organisms, including complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI), in conjunction with [metronidazole], and complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), including pyelonephritis, in patients aged three months and older. This combination is also indicated to treat hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP) in patients aged 18 years and older.[L45128]



In all cases, to mitigate the risk of bacterial resistance and preserve clinical efficacy, ceftazidime should only be used for infections that are confirmed or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacterial strains.[L32935, L45128]', 'The bacterial cell wall, which is located at the periphery of Gram-positive bacteria and within the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria, comprises a glycopeptide polymer synthesized through cross-linking of glycans to peptide stems on alternating saccharides, which is known commonly as peptidoglycan.[A232920] Cell wall formation, recycling, and remodelling require numerous enzymes, including a family of enzymes with similar active site character despite distinct and sometimes overlapping roles as carboxypeptidases, endopeptidases, transpeptidases, and transglycosylases, known as "penicillin-binding proteins" (PBPs). The number of PBPs differs between bacteria, in which some are considered essential and others redundant. In general, inhibition of one or more essential PBPs results in impaired cell wall homeostasis, loss of cell integrity, and is ultimately bactericidal.[A232920, A232925, A232930]



Ceftazidime is a semisynthetic third-generation cephalosporin with broad activity against numerous Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria.[L32935] Like other β-lactam antibiotics, ceftazidime exhibits its bactericidal effect primarily through direct inhibition of specific PBPs in susceptible bacteria.[A232935] _In vitro_ experiments in Gram-negative bacteria such as _Escherichia coli_, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, _Acinetobacter baumannii_, and _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ suggest that ceftazidime primarily binds to PBP3, with weaker binding to PBP1a/1b and PBP2 as well; although binding to other PBPs, such as PBP4, is detectable, the concentrations required are much greater than those achieved clinically.[A232935, A16721, A232940, A232945, A232950] Similarly, ceftazidime showed binding to _Staphylococcus aureus_ PBP 1, 2, and 3 with a much lower affinity for PBP4.[A16721] Recent data for _Mycobacterium abcessus_ suggest that ceftazidime can inhibit PonA1, PonA2, and PbpA at intermediate concentrations.[A232930]', 'Ceftazidime is a semisynthetic, broad-spectrum, third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic that is bactericidal through inhibition of enzymes responsible for cell-wall synthesis, primarily penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP3).[L32935] Among cephalosporins, ceftazidime is notable for its resistance to numerous β-lactamases and its broad spectrum of activity against Gram-negative bacteria, including _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_.[A232935] However, it is less active than first- and second-generation cephalosporins against _Staphylococcus aureus_ and other Gram-positive bacteria and also has low activity against anaerobes.[A232935, A233160] Ceftazidime has confirmed activity against clinically relevant Gram-negative bacteria including _Citrobacter_ spp., _Enterobacter_ spp., _Klebsiella_ spp., _Proteus_ spp., _Serratia spp., _Escherichia coli_, _Haemophilus influenzae_, _Neisseria meningitidis_, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, and some Gram-positive bacteria including _Staphylococcus_ spp. and _Streptococcus_ spp. There are also _in vitro_ data for ceftazidime efficacy against a wide variety of other bacteria, such as _Acinetobacter baumannii_ and _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_, but no clear clinical studies to support the use of ceftazidime for infections caused by these bacteria.[L32935]



Although β-lactam antibiotics like ceftazidime are generally well tolerated, there remains a risk of serious acute hypersensitivity reactions, which is higher in patients with a known allergy to ceftazidime or any other β-lactam antibiotic. As with all antibiotics, ceftazidime may result in the overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms and potentially serious effects including _Clostridium difficile_-associated diarrhea (CDAD); CDAD should be considered in patients who develop diarrhea and, in confirmed cases, supportive care initiated immediately. Ceftazidime is primarily renally excreted such that high and prolonged serum concentrations can occur in patients with renal insufficiency, leading to seizures, nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), encephalopathy, coma, asterixis, neuromuscular excitability, and myoclonia. Treatment may lead to the development or induction of resistance with a risk of treatment failure. Periodic susceptibility testing should be considered, and monotherapy failure may necessitate the addition of another antibiotic such as an aminoglycoside. Cephalosporin use may decrease prothrombin activity, which may be improved by exogenous vitamin K.

PGE<sub>2</sub> is the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.[A179023] It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.[T116,A179023] PGE<sub>2</sub> activates the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled EP<sub>1</sub> receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE<sub>2</sub> also activates the EP<sub>4</sub> receptor, coupled to G<sub>s</sub>, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE<sub>2</sub> act via EP<sub>3</sub> to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP<sub>2</sub> to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI<sub>2</sub> is known to play a role via its G<sub>s</sub>-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.



PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP<sub>2</sub> receptors.[T116,A179044] Similarly to β adrenergic receptors these are G<sub>s</sub>-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE<sub>2</sub> also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.[T116] PGD<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP<sub>1</sub> receptor.[A179044] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.



PGE<sub>2</sub> can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory G<sub>q</sub> EP<sub>3</sub> receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.[T116] This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever. NSAIDs prevent the generation of PGE<sub>2</sub> thereby reducing the activity of these neurons.

The number of PBPs differs between bacteria, in which some are considered essential and others redundant. In general, inhibition of one or more essential PBPs results in impaired cell wall homeostasis, loss of cell integrity, and is ultimately bactericidal.[A232920, A232925, A232930]



Cefixime is a cephalosporin and cephalosporins work by using their beta-lactam rings to inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to the penicillin-binding proteins transpeptidases on bacteria.[A262995,A262945,A262950] The inhibition of synthesis of the bacteria cell wall will cause lysis, particularly in fast growing organisms such as bacteria.[A262945] Specifically, cephalosporins inhibit penicillin-sensitive enzymes responsible for the final 3D structure of the bacterial cell wall which in turn inhibit bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis.[T894, T322] ', 'Cefixime, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, is an orally-active third-generation semisynthetic cephalosporin.[A262894,L49293] Like other cephalosporins, the antibacterial action of cefixime results from inhibition of cell wall synthesis.[L49293] Also like other cephalosporins, cefixime is stable when in the presence of certain beta-lactamase enzymes, which means certain organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalosporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases could be susceptible to cefixime.[L49293]

Concurrently, as one of the most commonly utilized forms of vitamin D, cholecalciferol is also very frequently used as a supplement in individuals to maintain sufficient vitamin d levels in the body or to treat vitamin D deficiency, as well as various medical conditions that can be associated directly or indirectly with vitamin d insufficiency like osteoporosis and chronic kidney disease, among others [A176041, A176044, F4051].', 'Most individuals naturally generate adequate amounts of vitamin D through ordinary dietary intake of vitamin D (in some foods like eggs, fish, and cheese) and natural photochemical conversion of the vitamin D3 precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin via exposure to sunlight [L5689, F4027, F4042, F4048].



Conversely, vitamin D deficiency can often occur from a combination of insufficient exposure to sunlight, inadequate dietary intake of vitamin D, genetic defects with endogenous vitamin D receptor, or even severe liver or kidney disease [A243]. Such deficiency is known for resulting in conditions like rickets or osteomalacia, all of which reflect inadequate mineralization of bone, enhanced compensatory skeletal demineralization, resultant decreased calcium ion blood concentrations, and increases in the production and secretion of parathyroid hormone [A223]. Increases in parathyroid hormone stimulate the mobilization of skeletal calcium and the renal excretion of phosphorus [A223]. This enhanced mobilization of skeletal calcium leads towards porotic bone conditions [A223].



Ordinarily, while vitamin D3 is made naturally via photochemical processes in the skin, both itself and vitamin D2 can be found in various food and pharmaceutical sources as dietary supplements. The principal biological function of vitamin D is the maintenance of normal levels of serum calcium and phosphorus in the bloodstream by enhancing the efficacy of the small intestine to absorb these minerals from the diet [A223]. At the liver, vitamin D3 or D2 is hydroxylated to 25-hydroxyvitamin D and then finally to the primary active metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in the kidney via further hydroxylation [A223, A243]. This final metabolite binds to endogenous vitamin d receptors, which results in a variety of regulatory roles - including maintaining  calcium balance, the regulation of parathyroid hormone, the promotion of the renal reabsorption of calcium, increased intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus, and increased calcium and phosphorus mobilization of calcium and phosphorus from bone to plasma to maintain balanced levels of each in bone and the plasma [A223, A243].



In particular, calcitriol interacts with vitamin D receptors in the small intestine to enhance the efficiency of intestinal calcium and phosphorous absorption from about 10-15% to 30-40% and 60% increased to 80%, respectively [L5689]. Furthermore, calcitriol binds with vitamin D receptors in osteoblasts to stimulate a receptor activator of nuclear factor kB ligand (or RANKL) which subsequently interacts with receptor activator of nuclear factor kB (NFkB) on immature preosteoclasts, causing them to become mature bone-resorbing osteoclasts [L5689]. Such mature osteoclasts ultimately function in removing calcium and phosphorus from bone to maintain blood calcium and phosphorus levels [L5689]. Moreover, calcitriol also stimulates calcium reabsorption from the glomerular filtrate in the kidneys [L5689].



Additionally, it is believed that when calcitriol binds with nuclear vitamin D receptors, that this bound complex itself binds to retinoic acid X receptor (RXR) to generate a heterodimeric complex that consequently binds to specific nucleotide sequences in the DNA called vitamin D response elements [L5689]. When bound, various transcription factors attach to this complex, resulting in either up or down-regulation of the associated gene''s activity. It is thought that there may be as much as 200 to 2000 genes that possess vitamin D response elements or that are influenced indirectly to control a multitude of genes across the genome [L5689].  It is in this way that cholecalciferol is believed to function in regulating gene transcription associated with cancer risk, autoimmune disorders, and cardiovascular disease linked to vitamin D deficiency [L5689]. In fact, there has been some research to suggest calcitriol may also be able to prevent malignancies by inducing cellular maturation and inducing apoptosis and inhibiting angiogenesis, exhibit anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting foam cell formation and promoting angiogenesis in endothelial colony-forming cells in vitro, inhibit immune reactions by enhancing the transcription of endogenous antibiotics like cathelicidin and regulate the activity and differentiation of CD4+ T cells, amongst a variety of other proposed actions [L5689].   ', 'The in vivo synthesis of the predominant two biologically active metabolites of vitamin D occurs in two steps. The first hydroxylation of vitamin D3 cholecalciferol (or D2) occurs in the liver to yield 25-hydroxyvitamin D while the second hydroxylation happens in the kidneys to give 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D [F4027, F4042, F4048]. These vitamin D metabolites subsequently facilitate the active absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the small intestine, serving to increase serum calcium and phosphate levels sufficiently to allow bone mineralization [F4027, F4042, F4048]. Conversely, these vitamin D metabolites also assist in mobilizing calcium and phosphate from bone and likely increase the reabsorption of calcium and perhaps also of phosphate via the renal tubules [F4027, F4042, F4048]. There exists a period of 10 to 24 hours between the administration of cholecalciferol and the initiation of its action in the body due to the necessity of synthesis of the active vitamin D metabolites in the liver and kidneys [F4027, F4042, F4048]. It is parathyroid hormone that is responsible for the regulation of such metabolism at the level of the kidneys [F4027, F4042, F4048].', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Nicorandil is an activator and opener of ATP-sensitive (ATP-dependent) potassium channels (KATP channels) that are composed of Kir6.x-type subunits and sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) subunits. Nicorandil binding sites are located in the sulfonylurea receptor 2 (SUR2) in the ATP-sensitive potassium channel [A20322], which are regulatory subunits of the channel that exhibit an ATPase activitiy [A12436]. There are 2 types of SUR2 subunits (2A/2B) that have identical nucleotide binding domains (NBD), where SUR2A is more predominantly expressed in skeletal and cardiac myocytes and SUR2B in smooth muscle cells [A12436]. Nicorandil more potently activates SUR2B/Kir6.2 than SUR2A/Kir6.2 channels to cause hyperpolarization. ATP-NBD1 interaction influences the channel signalling by nicorandil, and the response of the channel to nicorandil is also facilitated and heightened by the interaction of ATP or ADP with NBD2 [A20321]. Potentiated activity of ATP-sensitive channels have cardioprotective role by limiting the duration of action potentials and preventing intraceullar calcium overload [A20326]. This attenuates cellular injury by preserving cellular energetics and ultimately cell survival [A20324]. KATP channel-dependent membrane hyperpolarization can also lead to vasodilation via reduction in Ca2+ influx through the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and regulation of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in smooth muscle cells [A20324]. 

Nicorandil contain a nitrate moiety in its structure, making it a good dilator of vascular smooth muscle like other nitroglycerin esters [A20323]. Direct relaxation of venous vascular system arises from NO-donor mediated stimulation of guanylyl cyclase and increased levels of intracellular cyclic GMP (cGMP). Elevated levels of cGMP contributes to the total relaxing effect of nicorandil at higher concentrations of the drug [A7839]. ', 'Nicorandil is a potassium channel opener with nitrovasodilator (NO donor) actions, making it both an arterial and a venous dilator [T28]. It causes sustained dilation of both the arterial resistance and conductive vessels that increases coronary blood flow, however the effect of the drug on coronary arteries does not involve the coronary steal phenomenon [L887]. Activation of potassium channels lead to hyperpolarization of the smooth muscle cells, followed by arterial dilation and afterload reduction. Nicorandil is shown to increase pooling in the capacitance vessels with a decrease in preload through relaxing the venous vascular system. Overall, improved blood flow and reduced infarct size are achieved through reduction of end-diastolix pressure and decreased extravascular component of vascular resistance [L887].

Current knowledge suggests that levetiracetam’s binding to synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) is a key driver of its action. SV2A is a membrane-bound protein that is found on synaptic vesicles and is ubiquitous throughout the CNS[A12546] - it appears to play a role in vesicle exocytosis[L8606,L8615] and in the modulation of synaptic transmission by increasing the available amount of secretory vesicles available for neurotransmission.[A12552] Stimulation of pre-synaptic SV2A by levetiracetam may inhibit neurotransmitter release,[A12551] but this action does not appear to affect normal neurotransmission.

Benzoyl peroxide can also increase the turnover rate of epithelial cells, leading to skin peeling, and breaking down comedones.[A234069]', 'Benzoyl peroxide is a topical treatment for acne that generates free radicals to break down comedones and increase the rate of epithelial cell turnover.[A18903,A234059,A234064,A234069,L33264,L33269,L33299,L33314] It has a short duration of action as its active free radical metabolites quickly react to form inactive metabolites.[A18903] The therapeutic index is wide, as overdoses are rare, however patients may still experience skin peeling.[L33264,L33269,L33299,L33314] Patients should be counselled regarding increased risks of skin irritation, dryness, and sunburn.[L33264,L33269,L33299,L33314]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Levonorgestrel, in the single-agent emergency contraceptive form, is indicated for the prevention of pregnancy after the confirmed or suspected failure of contraception methods or following unprotected intercourse. It is distributed by prescription for patients under 17, and over the counter for those above this age.[L7760] This levonorgestrel-only form of contraception is not indicated for regular contraception and must be taken as soon as possible within 72 hours after intercourse.[A181976,L7760] It has shown a lower efficacy when it is used off label within 96 hours.[T659]



**Long-term contraception or nonemergency contraception**



In addition to the above indication in emergency contraception, levonorgestrel is combined with other contraceptives in contraceptive formulations designed for regular use, for example with ethinyl estradiol.[L7766] It is used in various hormone-releasing intrauterine devices for long-term contraception ranging for a duration of 3-5 years.[L7778,L7781,L7787] Product labeling for Mirena specifically mentions that it is recommended in women who have had at least 1 child and can be indicated for the prevention of pregnancy for up to 8 years.[L7778,L42950] A subdermal implant is also available for the prevention of pregnancy for up to 5 years.[L7823]



**Hormone therapy and off-label uses**



Levonorgestrel is prescribed in combination with estradiol as hormone therapy during menopause to manage vasomotor symptoms and to prevent osteoporosis.[L7805]Off-label, levonorgestrel may be used to treat menorrhagia, endometrial hyperplasia, and endometriosis.[T659]', '**Mechanism of action on ovulation**



Oral contraceptives containing levonorgestrel suppress gonadotropins, inhibiting ovulation. Specifically, levonorgestrel binds to progesterone and androgen receptors and slows the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. This process results in the suppression of the normal physiological luteinizing hormone (LH) surge that precedes ovulation. It inhibits the rupture of follicles and viable egg release from the ovaries. Levonorgestrel has been proven to be more effective when administered before ovulation.[T659]



**Mechanism of action in cervical mucus changes**



Similar to other levonorgestrel-containing contraceptives, the intrauterine (IUD) forms of levonorgestrel likely prevent pregnancy by increasing the thickness of cervical mucus, interfering with the movement and survival of sperm, and inducing changes in the endometrium, where a fertilized ovum is usually implanted.[L7778,L7781] Levonorgestrel is reported to alter the consistency of mucus in the cervix, which interferes with sperm migration into the uterus for fertilization. Levonorgestrel is not effective after implantation has occurred.[A181976] 

Interestingly, recent evidence has refuted the commonly believed notion that levonorgestrel changes the consistency of cervical mucus when it is taken over a short-term period, as in emergency contraception. Over a long-term period, however, levonorgestrel has been proven to thicken cervical mucus.[A181976] The exact mechanism of action of levonorgestrel is not completely understood and remains a topic of controversy and ongoing investigation.[A181976,L7760]



*Effects on implantation**



The effects of levonorgestrel on endometrial receptivity are unclear, and the relevance of this mechanism to the therapeutic efficacy of levonorgestrel is contentious.[A175372,A218666] Prescribing information for levonorgestrel IUDs state that they exert local morphological changes to the endometrium (e.g. stromal pseudodecidualization, glandular atrophy) that may play a role in their contraceptive activity.[L7778,L7781]



**Mechanism of action in hormone therapy**



When combined with estrogens for the treatment of menopausal symptoms and prevention of osteoporosis, levonorgestrel serves to lower the carcinogenic risk of unopposed estrogen therapy via the inhibition of endometrial proliferation. Unregulated endometrial proliferation sometimes leads to endometrial cancer after estrogen use.[L7808]', 'Levonorgestrel prevents pregnancy by interfering with ovulation, fertilization, and implantation. The levonorgestrel-only containing emergency contraceptive tablet is 89% effective if it is used according to prescribing information within 72 hours after intercourse.[A181976,A181988] The intrauterine and implantable devices releasing levonorgestrel are more than 99% in preventing pregnancy.[A182123,L7778,L7781] Levonorgestrel utilized as a component of hormonal therapy helps to prevent endometrial carcinoma associated with unopposed estrogen administration.[A182042]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Cladribine can also induce cytotoxicity via other mechanisms. It induces poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a DNA repair enzyme, that exhausts the intracellular levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), thereby causing apoptotic cell death.[A350] Recent evidence shows that cladribine can trigger apoptosis by changing the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, allowing cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor to move into the cytosol. This initiates apoptosis through both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways.[A350]', 'Cladribine is an antineoplastic agent with cytotoxic effects on actively dividing and quiescent B and T lymphocytes and monocytes.[L50688, L50693] It produces a dose-dependent reduction in lymphocyte count.[L50688] Because cladribine is resistant to deamination by adenosine deaminase (ADA), a purine-degrading enzyme, it is reported to have a prolonged intracellular residence time.[A350, A263723]

Depolarization leads to activation and opening of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and consequently an influx of calcium ions into the cell.[A177727] Elevated intracellular calcium levels causes the contraction of the filaments of actomyosin responsible for the exocytosis of insulin granules stored in vesicles.[A177715] Glimepiride blocks the ATP-sensitive potassium channel by binding non-specifically to the B sites of both sulfonylurea receptor-1 (SUR1) and sulfonylurea receptor-2A (SUR2A) subunits as well as the A site of SUR1 subunit of the channel to promote insulin secretion from the beta cell.[A177715] ', 'Glimepiride stimulates the secretion of insulin granules from the pancreatic beta cells and improves the sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin to increase peripheral glucose uptake, thus reducing plasma blood glucose levels and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels.

In the inflammatory environment that causes tissue damage, EGb promoted nitric oxide production, leading to enhanced peripheral and cerebral blood flow.[A232379] ', '_Ginkgo biloba_ is a herbal ingredient with demonstrated antioxidant, vasoactive, antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, antiplatelet, and fibrinolytic properties.[A232389, A232399] _Ginkgo biloba_ has been investigated for use in a variety of medical conditions, but the most extensively studied area is in the context of cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative disorders. _Ginkgo biloba_ was examined as a potential nootropic agent or cognitive enhancer but research findings supporting the therapeutic efficacy of _ginkgo biloba_ extract (EGb) in dementia remain controversial. Some clinical studies of dementia that were up to one year long showed that EGb improves the cognitive performance and social functioning of patients. However, other studies did not support its clinical benefit for patients with cognitive impairment and dementia. Numerous meta-analysis studies showed insufficient evidence of the effectiveness of EGb in reducing both all-cause dementia incidence and Alzheimer''s disease-associated dementia incidence in elderly patients with normal cognition or with mild cognitive impairment. Additionally, there is no up-to-date evidence that demonstrates the benefit of the long-term use of standardized EGb in reducing the risk of progression to Alzheimer''s disease. A 2012 meta-analysis did not support the use of EGb in enhancing cognitive function in healthy adults.[A232379]



In the context of cardiovascular diseases, a limited number of studies showed that EGb improved mortality or neurological recovery in the post-stroke period, reduced cognitive and neurological impairment after acute ischemic stroke, and improved blood flow in the coronary artery in patients with coronary artery disease. However, a systemic review found no statistical or clinically significant benefit of EGb for patients with peripheral arterial disease or hypertension. Overall, there is a lack of strong evidence in the use of EGb for the treatment or prevention of cardiovascular diseases.[A232379]



In a small trial, the use of EGb as an adjunctive treatment with citalopram improved depressive symptoms and cognitive function in patients with depression.[A232379] _Ginkgo biloba_ was also investigated as a potential treatment for antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction.[A2434] Another study showed EGb improving the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia. There is insufficient evidence to prove the effectiveness of EGb in these psychiatric disorders. Limited studies have investigated the role of _ginkgo biloba_ in the treatment of vertigo, tinnitus, vitiligo, macular degeneration, and glaucoma, as well as the prevention of acute mountain sickness. As results are either preliminary or controversial, more quality research is warranted.[A232379]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Insulin binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor is able to autophosphorylate and phosphorylate numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. These activated proteins, in turn, lead to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC) which play a critical role in metabolism and catabolism.', 'Insulin is a natural hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas. In non-diabetic individuals, a basal level of insulin is supplemented with insulin spikes following meals. Postprandial insulin spikes are responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to absorptive state. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis.

Off-label uses: irritable bowel syndrome, sleep disorders, diabetic neuropathy, agitation, fibromyalgia, and insomnia ', 'The mechanism of action of this drug is not fully elucidated. It is suggested that amitriptyline inhibits the membrane pump mechanism responsible for the re-uptake of transmitter amines, such as norepinephrine and serotonin, thereby increasing their concentration at the synaptic clefts of the brain [FDA label], [A174673].   These amines are important in regulating mood.  The monoamine hypothesis in depression, one of the oldest hypotheses, postulates that deficiencies of serotonin (5-HT) and/or norepinephrine (NE) neurotransmission in the brain lead to depressive effects [A174670].   This drug counteracts these mechanisms, and this may be the mechanism of amitriptyline in improving depressive symptoms.



Whether its analgesic effects are related to its mood-altering activities or attributable to a different, less obvious pharmacological action (or a combination of both) is unknown [A174661].', '**Effects in pain and depression**



Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant and an analgesic. It has anticholinergic and sedative properties [FDA label]. 

Clinical studies have shown that oral amitriptyline achieves, at a minimum, good to moderate response in up to 2/3 of patients diagnosed with post-herpetic neuralgia and 3/4 of patients diagnosed with diabetic neuropathic pain, and neurogenic pain syndromes that are frequently unresponsive to narcotic analgesics. Amitriptyline has also shown efficacy in diverse groups of patients with chronic non-malignant pain. There have also been some studies showing efficacy in managing fibromyalgia (an off-label use of this drug) [A174658], [A174667].



**Cardiovascular and Anticholinergic Effects**



Amitriptyline has strong anticholinergic properties and may cause ECG changes and quinidine-like effects on the heart [F3454]. Amitriptyline may inhibit ion channels, which are necessary for cardiac repolarization (hERG channels), in the upper micromolar range of therapeutic plasma concentrations. Therefore, amitriptyline may increase the risk for cardiac arrhythmia [FDA label]. Orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia can be a problem in elderly patients receiving this drug at normal doses for depression. There is evidence in the literature that these effects may occur, rarely, at the lower dosages utilized in the treatment of pain. As with any other tricyclic antidepressant agent, increased glucose levels can occur with amitriptyline [A174661].

Clinical studies have shown amikacin sulfate injection to be effective in bacterial septicemia (including neonatal sepsis); in serious infections of the respiratory tract, bones and joints, central nervous system (including meningitis) and skin and soft tissue; intra-abdominal infections (including peritonitis); and in burns and postoperative infections (including post-vascular surgery).[F1954]

**Important notes regarding Staphylococcus and Sensitivity testing:**



Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains, is the principal Gram-positive organism sensitive to amikacin.

The use of amikacin in the treatment of staphylococcal infections should be restricted only to second-line therapy, and should be limited to only those patients suffering from severe infections caused by susceptible strains of staphylococcus species who have failed to show sensitivity to other available antibiotics.[F1949]



Bacteriologic studies should be performed to identify causative organisms and their susceptibilities to amikacin. Amikacin may be used as initial therapy in suspected gram-negative infections and therapy may be initiated before obtaining the results of susceptibility testing.[Label,F1949,F1954]', 'The primary mechanism of action of amikacin is the same as that for all aminoglycosides. It binds to bacterial 30S ribosomal subunits and interferes with mRNA binding and tRNA acceptor sites, interfering with bacterial growth. This leads to disruption of normal protein synthesis and production of non-functional or toxic peptides. Other actions have been postulated for drugs of this class.[Label,F1949,F1950] Amikacin, as well as the rest of the aminoglycosides, are generally bacteriocidal against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.[L4680,F1954]', 'Amikacin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic.

Indicated for the treatment of persistent (non-transient) facial erythema of rosacea in adults 18 years of age or older.[L6535]', 'In the eye, alpha-1 adrenoceptors play a role in vasoconstriction, mydriasis, eyelid retraction, and elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) whereas alpha-2 adrenoceptors are responsible for IOP reduction via a complex Gi-coupled signaling cascade pathway. Activation of alpha-2 receptors leads to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and reduction of cyclic AMP levels. As a result, there is a decrease in norpinephrine (NE) release at the synaptic junction, NE-induced stimulation of beta-2 adrenoceptors, and production of aqueous humor by the ciliary epithelium.[A178969] An elevated IOP is the most significant risk factor for developing glaucomatous optic neuropathy, which is associated with progressive visual field loss and functional disability if left untreated.[A179002] Regardless of the etiology of the disease, the aim of current therapies for glaucoma is to reduce IOP, as reduction of IOP significantly reduces the risk of progression of vision loss even when IOP is already within the normal range.[A36674] When administered ophthalmically, brimonidine is rapidly absorbed into the eye, acts as an agonist at ocular alpha-2 adrenoceptors and lowers IOP via a dual mechanism of action.[A178981] It is proposed that initial dosing of the drug causes a reduction in aqueous humour production and chronic dosing leads to an increase in uveoscleral outflow.[A179002] Brimonidine does not affect episcleral venous pressure.[A178969] By reducing IOP, brimonidine aims to reduce the likelihood of glaucomatous visual field loss in ocular hypertension, and slow the progression of visual field defect in established open-angle glaucoma.[A178951] When applied topically on skin, brimonidine reduces erythema through direct vasocontriction of small arteries and veins.[A178978] As brimonidine mediates a potent peripheral vasoconstrictive activity by selectively working on the alpha-2 adrenoceptors, the use of brimonidine is thought to be efficacious for the treatment of facial erythema of rosacea, which is thought to arise from vasomotor instability and abnormal vasodilation of the superficial cutaneous vasculature of the face.[A178984]', 'Brimonidine is a highly selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist that is 1000-fold more selective for the alpha2-adrenergic receptor than the alpha1-adrenergic receptor.[L6544] This characteristic gives the drug some therapeutic advantages, since it reduces the risk of systemic side effects, such as systemic hypotension, bradycardia, and sedation. In addition, there is a reduction in the risk for developing alpha-1 mediated ocular unwanted effects, such as conjunctival blanching, mydriasis, and eyelid retraction.[A179002] However, despite high alpha-2 receptor specificity, brimonidine may still produce alpha-1 adrenoceptor-mediated ocular effects, such as conjunctival vasoconstriction.[A178969] Brimonidine has a peak ocular hypotensive effect occurring at two hours post-dosing.[label] In a randomized, double-blind clinical study, ocular administration of 0.2% brimonidine in healthy volunteers resulted in a 23% reduction of mean intraocular pressure from baseline at 3 hours following administration.[A178951] In comparative studies consisting of patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, the ocular hypotensive effect of brimonidine was maintained during treatment periods of up to 1 year.[A178945] 



Brimonidine mediates vasoconstrictive effects and it was shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory properties in _ex vivo_ human skin model and _in vivo_ inflammation models.[A179041] In a clinial trials consisting of adults with moderate to severe facial erythema of rosacea, brimonidine was shown to improve the extent of redness at 3 hours after application, compared to placebo.[L6544] It was shown to be a potent vasoconstrictor of human subcutaneous vessels with a diameter of less than 200 µm. In _in vivo_ mouse inflammation models, brimonidine displayed anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting edema.[A178978] In a randomized, double-blind study, brimonidine reduced erythema for the 12 hours of the study in a dose-dependent manner.[A178978]



When adminsitered systemically, brimonidine was shown to cause cardiovascular effects by decreasing blood pressure, decreasing heart and respiratory rate, and prolonging the PR interval in the electrocardiogram. This is due to the targeting of adrenoceptors by the drug.[A178963,A178966] Although the clinical significance has not been established, there is evidence that brimonidine exhibits neuroprotective activity in experimental models of cerebral ischemia and optic nerve injury.[A178969] _In vitro_ studies show that brimonidine mediated protective effects on neuronal cells from kainate acid insult and on cultured retinal ganglion cells from glutamate-induced cytotoxicity, which is a possible mediator of secondary neuronal degeneration in human glaucoma. Neuroprotective actions of brimonidine were also demonstrated in rat models of acute retinal ischemia and chronic IOP elevation. It has been proposed that brimonidine may exert neuroprotective effects on the retina and optic nerve by enhancing intrinsic retinal ganglion cell survival mechanisms and/or induction of neuronal survival factors, such as bFGF.[A178951] However, further investigations are needed to conclude on these possible therapeutic benefits of the drug.', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

[L39095] Patients may experience ED due to a variety of causes including psychogenic, neurogenic, vasculogenic, iatrogenic, or endocrine. [A242392] These causes result in dysfunction of penile smooth muscle relaxation through either disrupted neuronal signaling or direct influence on smooth muscle cells. During sexual arousal, non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) neurons release nitric oxide (NO). Nitric oxide stimulates guanylate cyclase which converts guanosine triphosphate to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).[A242287, A242377] cGMP activates the cGMP-dependent kinase (PKG) in a signal cascade which activates K+ channels leading to inhibition of Ca2+ channels, inhibits platelet activation, and inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation while inducing apoptosis. This signal cascade is attenuated by PDE5 which breaks the phosphodiester bond of cGMP, converting it to GMP. Inhibition of PDE5 by tadalafil increases signaling via the PKG cascade which supports penile smooth muscle relaxation during sexual arousal by decreasing Ca2+ entry into smooth muscle cells. This smooth muscle relaxation allows blood to fill the corpus cavernosum thereby producing an erection.



In PAH, blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries is raised due to a variety of mechanisms stemming from endothelial dysfunction.[A242377] Decreased production of NO and prostacyclin reduce vasodilatory signaling while overproduction of endothelin-1 and thromboxane increase vasoconstriction. Inflammation, thromboses, and hypoxia later contribute to vascular remodeling which further reduces luminal size. The resultant increase in blood pressure reduces the capacity for gas exchange and increases afterload at the right ventricle, producing symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and dizziness as well as leading to right-sided heart failure. Tadalafil exerts its therapeutic effect in PAH through boosting NO-cGMP signaling to contribute to smooth muscle relaxation as with ED.



Lastly, tadalafil is used to treat BPH.[L39095] BPH produces urinary dysfunction through hyperproliferation of the epithelial and smooth muscle layers of the prostate.[A242382] The increased size of the prostate blocks urine flow through the urethra resulting in higher residual volumes due to incomplete emptying. Tadalafil does not appear to exert its benefit via smooth muscle relaxation of the prostate. It may instead exert its effect through a mix of increased oxygenation and decreased inflammation, which decreases tissue remodeling, and inhibition of cell proliferation through the cGMP cascade.



The decreased affinity for PDE6 compared to other PDE5 inhibitors may explain the decreased incidence of visual side effects as PDE6 is present in the eye and contributes to color vision.[L39100, L39105, A242287]', 'Tadalafil exerts a therapeutic effect in ED by increasing sexual stimulation-dependant smooth muscle relaxation in the penis, allowing the corpus cavernosum to fill with blood to produce an erection.[A242287, A242377] Smooth muscle relaxation in the pulmonary vasculature helps to produce vasodilation in PAH which reduces blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries.[A242377] In BPH, tadalafil may contribute to decreased smooth muscle cell proliferation which may reduce the size of the prostate and relieve the anatomical obstruction which produces urinary symptoms of BPH.[A242382] The decreased affinity of tadalafil for PDE6 compared to other PDE5 inhibitors may explain the reduced incidence of visual side effects.[L39100, L39105, A242287]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Potassium ions participate in a number of essential physiological processes including the maintenance of intracellular tonicity, the transmission of nerve impulses, the contraction of cardiac, skeletal and smooth muscle, and the maintenance of normal renal function. The intracellular concentration of potassium is approximately 150 to 160 mEq per liter. The normal adult plasma concentration is 3.5 to 5 mEq per liter. An active ion transport system maintains this gradient across the plasma membrane. Potassium is a normal dietary constituent and under steady-state conditions the amount of potassium absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract is equal to the amount excreted in the urine. The usual dietary intake of potassium is 50 to 100 mEq per day. Potassium depletion will occur whenever the rate of potassium loss through renal excretion and/or loss from the gastrointestinal tract exceeds the rate of potassium intake. Such depletion usually develops as a consequence of therapy with diuretics, primarily or secondary hyperaldosteronism, diabetic ketoacidosis, or inadequate replacement of potassium in patients on prolonged parenteral nutrition. Depletion can develop rapidly with severe diarrhea, especially if associated with vomiting. Potassium depletion due to these causes is usually accompanied by concomitant loss of chloride and is manifested by hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Potassium depletion may produce weakness, fatigue, disturbances of cardiac rhythm (primarily ectopic beats), prominent U-waves in the electrocardiogram, and, in advanced cases, flaccid paralysis and/or impaired ability to concentrate urine. If potassium depletion associated with metabolic alkalosis cannot be managed by correcting the fundamental cause of the deficiency, e.g., where the patient requires long-term diuretic therapy, supplemental potassium in the form of high potassium food or potassium chloride may be able to restore normal potassium levels. In rare circumstances (e.g., patients with renal tubular acidosis) potassium depletion may be associated with metabolic acidosis and hyperchloremia. In such patients, potassium replacement should be accomplished with potassium salts other than the chloride, such as potassium bicarbonate, potassium citrate, potassium acetate, or potassium gluconate.', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

The retention of phosphate plays a pivotal role in causing secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with osteodystrophy, and soft-tissue calcification. The mechanism by which phosphate retention leads to hyperparathyroidism is not clearly delineated. Therapeutic efforts directed toward the control of hyperphosphatemia include reduction in the dietary intake of phosphate, inhibition of absorption of phosphate in the intestine with phosphate binders, and removal of phosphate from the body by more efficient methods of dialysis. The rate of removal of phosphate by dietary manipulation or by dialysis is insufficient. Dialysis patients absorb 40% to 80% of dietary phosphorus. Therefore, the fraction of dietary phosphate absorbed from the diet needs to be reduced by using phosphate binders in most renal failure patients on maintenance dialysis. Calcium acetate when taken with meals combines with dietary phosphate to form insoluble calcium phosphate which is excreted in the feces. Maintenance of serum phosphorus below 6.0 mg/dl is generally considered as a clinically acceptable outcome of treatment with phosphate binders.

Dyslipidemia describes an elevation of plasma cholesterol, triglycerides or both as well as to the presence of low levels of high-density lipoprotein. This condition represents an increased risk for the development of atherosclerosis.[L6025] 



Atorvastatin is indicated, in combination with dietary modifications, to prevent cardiovascular events in patients with cardiac risk factors and/or abnormal lipid profiles.[A177397]



Atorvastatin can be used as a preventive agent for myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization, and angina, in patients without coronary heart disease but with multiple risk factors and in patients with type 2 diabetes without coronary heart disease but multiple risk factors.[A177397]



Atorvastatin may be used as a preventive agent for non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal and non-fatal stroke, revascularization procedures, hospitalization for congestive heart failure and angina in patients with coronary heart disease.[A177397]



Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]', 'Atorvastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A177388,A181421] Atorvastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, which increases hepatic uptake of LDL. Atorvastatin also reduces Very-Low-Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol (VLDL-C), serum triglycerides (TG) and Intermediate Density Lipoproteins (IDL), as well as the number of apolipoprotein B (apo B) containing particles, but increases High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C). 



_In vitro_ and _in vivo_ animal studies also demonstrate that atorvastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] These effects include improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response. Statins were also found to bind allosterically to β2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an essential role in leukocyte trafficking and T cell activation.[A181559]', 'Atorvastatin is an oral antilipemic agent that reversibly inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. It lowers total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apo B), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease, and high ratios are associated with a higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, atorvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A174580,A181087,A181406,A181925] 



Elevated cholesterol levels (and high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in particular) are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Clinical studies have shown that atorvastatin reduces LDL-C and total cholesterol by 36-53%.[A177415] In patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia, atorvastatin reduced the levels of intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol.[A177397] It has also been suggested that atorvastatin can limit the extent of angiogenesis, which can be useful in the treatment of chronic subdural hematoma.[A177388]



**Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis**



Atorvastatin, like other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, is associated with a risk of drug-induced myopathy characterized by muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness in conjunction with elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK). Myopathy often manifests as rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria. The risk of statin-induced myopathy is dose-related, and the symptoms of myopathy are typically resolved upon drug discontinuation. Results from observational studies suggest that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]



**Liver Dysfunction**



Statins, like some other lipid-lowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (> 3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] occurring on two or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin in clinical trials. This effect appears to be dose-related.[F4670,F4673]



**Endocrine Effects**



Statins are associated with a risk of increased serum HbA1c and glucose levels. An _in vitro_ study demonstrated a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on human pancreatic islet β cells following treatment with atorvastatin. Moreover, insulin secretion rates decreased relative to control.[A182012]



HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and may theoretically interfere with the production of adrenal and/or gonadal steroids. Clinical studies with atorvastatin and other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have suggested that these agents do not affect plasma cortisol concentrations, basal plasma testosterone concentration, or adrenal reserve. However, the effect of statins on male fertility has not been fully investigated. The effects of statins on the pituitary-gonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown.[F4673]



**Cardiovascular**



Significant decreases in circulating ubiquinone levels in patients treated with atorvastatin and other statins have been observed. The clinical significance of a potential long-term statin-induced deficiency of ubiquinone has not been established. It has been reported that a decrease in myocardial ubiquinone levels could lead to impaired cardiac function in patients with borderline congestive heart failure.[F4673]



**Lipoprotein A**



In some patients, the beneficial effect of lowered total cholesterol and LDL-C levels may be partly blunted by the concomitant increase in Lp(a) lipoprotein concentrations. Present knowledge suggests the importance of high Lp(a) levels as an emerging risk factor for coronary heart disease.[F4673] Further studies have demonstrated statins affect Lp(a) levels differently in patients with dyslipidemia depending on their apo(a) phenotype; statins increase Lp(a) levels exclusively in patients with the low molecular weight apo(a) phenotype.[A181418]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

A deficiency in iron indicates that the body cannot produce enough normal red blood cells.[A32514,L11800] Iron deficiency anemia occurs when body stores of iron decrease to very low levels, and the stored iron is insufficient to support normal red blood cell (RBC) production. Insufficient dietary iron, impaired iron absorption, bleeding, pregnancy, or loss of iron through the urine can lead to iron deficiency.[A32514,L11794]  Symptoms of iron deficiency anemia include fatigue, breathlessness, palpitations, dizziness, and headache.



Taking iron in supplement form, such as ferrous sulfate, allows for more rapid increases in iron levels when dietary supply and stores are not sufficient.[L2175] Iron is transported by the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) across the endolysosomal membrane to enter the macrophage. It can then can be incorporated into ferritin and be stored in the macrophage or carried of the macrophage by ferroportin. This exported iron is  oxidized by the enzyme to ceruloplasmin to Fe3+, followed by sequestration by transferrin for transport in the serum to various sites, including the bone marrow for hemoglobin synthesis or into the liver.[A32524] Iron combines with porphyrin and globin chains to form hemoglobin, which is critical for oxygen delivery from the lungs to other tissues.[L2263]', 'Ferrous sulfate replenishes iron, an essential component in hemoglobin, myoglobin, and various enzymes. It replaces the iron that is usually found in hemoglobin and myoglobin. Iron participates in oxygen transport and storage, electron transport and energy metabolism, antioxidant and beneficial pro-oxidant functions, oxygen sensing, tissue proliferation and growth, as well as DNA replication and repair.[A32524,A32514]

Cineol containing preparations of eucalyptus oil may contain up to 80% (or more) 1,8-cineole [A32243] and is one of the most common types of eucalyptus oil formulations used. As an active agent indicated for relieving certain cold symptoms and/or certain muscular sprains and cramps, it is believed that eucalyptus oil may possess some antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities.



Some in vitro studies of human blood monocytes suggest a dose-dependent effect of eucalyptus oil to elicit significant inhibition of multiple cytokines, perhaps in the treatment of airway inflammation [A32244, A32245]. Moreover, other studies in animal models discuss the possibility of eucalyptus oil demonstrating anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects that potentially account for inhibiting the formation of prostaglandins and cytokines by stimulated monocytes in vitro [A32246, A32247].



Furthermore, additional studies have observed eucalyptus oil anti-viral activity against herpes simplex virus (HSV-1, HSV-2) in cell cultures as well as the demonstration of broad antimicrobial activity of eucalyptus medicinal plant extracts against Alicyclobacillus acidoterretris, Bacillus cereus, E. coli, Enterococcus faecalis, MRSA, Propionibacterium acnes, S. aureus, fungus including C. albicans isolates, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and other Gram-positive bacteria.

By targeting CD20, rituximab promotes cell lysis while sparing hematopoietic and plasma cells without this surface antigen.[A40017,A248980] It has been suggested that cell lysis mechanisms triggered by rituximab include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) [L26641]. Rituximab is part of the immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) subclass of antibodies, and is formed by a murine variable region (Fab region) and a human constant region (Fc region). The Fab region gives rituximab its specificity for CD20, while the Fc region interacts with cell surface receptors to activate the immune system, leading to the depletion of circulating B lymphocytes [A40017].



In regards to the mechanism of action in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), B-cells are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of RA and the associated condition of chronic synovitis.[L26641] B-cells may act at various sites in the autoimmune/inflammatory process through the production of rheumatoid factor (RF) and other autoantibodies, antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and the production of proinflammatory cytokines [L26641]. The administration of rituximab in this condition has resulted in significant clinical and symptomatic improvements [A125,L26641]. Rituximab is also indicated for the treatment of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), two conditions characterized by the presence of circulating antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and increased B-cell activity. It has been suggested that rituximab depletes CD20<sup>+</sup> B-cells at a higher rate in GPA and MPA patients with high levels of Fc receptor-like 5 (FCRL5).[A248985]', 'Rituximab is a chimeric murine/human monoclonal antibody that binds to the CD20 antigen. CD20 is predominantly expressed on the surface of pre-B and mature B-lymphocytes, allowing rituximab to target and promote lysis in this specific type of cells.[A40017,A248980,L26641]. In Non-Hodgkin''s Lymphoma patients, rituximab treatment depleted circulating and tissue-based B-cells. In a study that included 166 patients, CD19-positive B-cells were depleted within three weeks, and in 83% of patients, cell depletion lasted up to 6-9 months. B-cell levels started to recover at approximately 6 months and returned to normal 12 months after treatment was completed. Approximately 14% of Non-Hodgkin''s Lymphoma patients had IgM or IgG serum levels below the normal range [L26641]. 



Most rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients treated with rituximab showed a near-complete depletion of peripheral B lymphocytes within 2 weeks after the first dose. Peripheral B-cell depletion was sustained for at least 6 months, and in approximately 4% of RA patients, peripheral B-cell depletion was sustained for more than 3 years after a single course of rituximab treatment.[L26641] Total IgG, IgA, and, more specifically, IgM levels were lower 24 weeks after the first cycle of rituximab treatment (2.8%, 0.8% and 10% below the lower limit of normal, respectively). However, the clinical consequences of this decrease in immunoglobulin levels in RA patients are not clear at this time. Treatment with rituximab in patients with RA was also associated with a decreased level of inflammation markers.[L26641]



In patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) treated with rituximab, CD19 B-cells in peripheral blood were depleted to less than 10 cells/μl after the first two infusions. By month 6, approximately 84% of patients had the same level of peripheral blood CD19 B-cells, and by month 12, 81% of patients demonstrated signs of B-cell return with counts >10 cells/μL.

The retention of phosphate plays a pivotal role in causing secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with osteodystrophy, and soft-tissue calcification. The mechanism by which phosphate retention leads to hyperparathyroidism is not clearly delineated. Therapeutic efforts directed toward the control of hyperphosphatemia include reduction in the dietary intake of phosphate, inhibition of absorption of phosphate in the intestine with phosphate binders, and removal of phosphate from the body by more efficient methods of dialysis. The rate of removal of phosphate by dietary manipulation or by dialysis is insufficient. Dialysis patients absorb 40% to 80% of dietary phosphorus. Therefore, the fraction of dietary phosphate absorbed from the diet needs to be reduced by using phosphate binders in most renal failure patients on maintenance dialysis. Calcium acetate when taken with meals combines with dietary phosphate to form insoluble calcium phosphate which is excreted in the feces.

It is also used in combination with [sacubitril].[L36445]', 'Valsartan belongs to the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs, which selectively bind to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) and prevent angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects. These include vasoconstriction, stimulation and synthesis of aldosterone and ADH, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium among others. Overall, valsartan''s physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium. 



Valsartan also affects the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays an important role in hemostasis and regulation of kidney, vascular, and cardiac functions. Pharmacological blockade of RAAS via  AT1 receptor blockade inhibits negative regulatory feedback within RAAS which is a contributing factor to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal disease. In particular, heart failure is associated with chronic activation of RAAS, leading to inappropriate fluid retention, vasoconstriction, and ultimately a further decline in left ventricular function. ARBs have been shown to have a protective effect on the heart by improving cardiac function, reducing afterload, increasing cardiac output and prevent ventricular hypertrophy.[A174154]



The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) class of medications (which includes drugs such as [ramipril], [lisinopril], and [perindopril]) inhibits the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II by inhibiting the ACE enzyme but does not prevent the formation of all angiotensin II. ARB activity is unique in that it blocks all angiotensin II activity, regardless of where or how it was synthesized. 



Valsartan is commonly used for the management of hypertension, heart failure, and type 2 diabetes-associated nephropathy, particularly in patients who are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors. ARBs such as valsartan have been shown in a number of large-scale clinical outcomes trials to improve cardiovascular outcomes including reducing risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, the progression of heart failure, and hospitalization.[A174124,A178153,A173869,A185324,A185327,A185333,A185342,A185345] Valsartan also slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy due to its renoprotective effects.[A174157,A174160,A174163] Improvements in chronic kidney disease with valsartan include both clinically and statistically significant decreases in urinary albumin and protein excretion in patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and in nondiabetic patients diagnosed with chronic kidney disease.[A174124,A173869]



Valsartan also binds to the AT2 receptor, however AT2 is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis like AT1. Valsartan has about 20,000-fold higher affinity for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. The increased plasma levels of angiotensin II following AT1 receptor blockade with valsartan may stimulate the unblocked AT2 receptor.[L11305]', 'Valsartan inhibits the pressor effects of angiotensin II with oral doses of 80 mg inhibiting the pressor effect by about 80% at peak with approximately 30% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. Removal of the negative feedback of angiotensin II causes a 2- to 3-fold rise in plasma renin and consequent rise in angiotensin II plasma concentration in hypertensive patients. Minimal decreases in plasma aldosterone were observed after administration of valsartan.



In multiple-dose studies in hypertensive patients, valsartan had no notable effects on total cholesterol, fasting triglycerides, fasting serum glucose, or uric acid.[L11305]



**Hypotension** 



Excessive hypotension was rarely seen (0.1%) in patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with valsartan alone. In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- and/or salt-depleted patients receiving high doses of diuretics, symptomatic hypotension may occur. This condition should be corrected prior to administration of valsartan, or the treatment should start under close medical supervision. 



Caution should be observed when initiating therapy in patients with heart failure. Patients with heart failure given valsartan commonly have some reduction in blood pressure, but discontinuation of therapy because of continuing symptomatic hypotension usually is not necessary when dosing instructions are followed. In controlled trials in heart failure patients, the incidence of hypotension in valsartan-treated patients was 5.5% compared to 1.8% in placebo-treated patients. 



If excessive hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized.[L11305]





**Impaired Renal Function**



Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and by diuretics. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on valsartan. Monitor renal function periodically in these patients. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on valsartan.[L11305]





**Hyperkalemia**



Some patients with heart failure have developed increases in potassium. These effects are usually minor and transient, and they are more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Dosage reduction and/or discontinuation of valsartan may be required.[L11305]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

', '**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].



Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].



In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].



There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].



Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].



The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. 



In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].



In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].



The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].', 'Zinc is involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of human proteins may bind zinc, in addition to hundreds of proteins that transport and traffic zinc. It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is an essential element for a proper sense of taste and smell and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations [L2211].



Studies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions [L2095]:



**Colds:** Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently [L2095].



**Wound healing:** Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements [L2095]. 



**Diahrrea**: Oral zinc supplements can reduce the symptoms of diarrhea in children with low levels of zinc, especially in cases of malnutrition [L2095].

Unique among the azoles, miconazole is thought to act through three main mechanisms.[A203636] The primary mechanism of action is through inhibition of the CYP450 14α-lanosterol demethylase enzyme, which results in altered ergosterol production and impaired cell membrane composition and permeability, which in turn leads to cation, phosphate, and low molecular weight protein leakage.[A203636, A203639]



In addition, miconazole inhibits fungal peroxidase and catalase while not affecting NADH oxidase activity, leading to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).[A203636, A203639, A203642] Increased intracellular ROS leads to downstream pleiotropic effects and eventual apoptosis.[A203636]



Lastly, likely as a result of lanosterol demethylation inhibition, miconazole causes a rise in intracellular levels of farnesol. This molecule participates in quorum sensing in _Candida_, preventing the transition from yeast to mycelial forms and thereby the formation of biofilms, which are more resistant to antibiotics.[A203645, A203648] In addition, farnesol is an inhibitor of drug efflux ABC transporters, namely _Candida_ CaCdr1p and CaCdr2p, which may additionally contribute to increased effectiveness of azole drugs.[A203648]', 'Miconazole is an azole antifungal that functions primarily through inhibition of a specific demethylase within the CYP450 complex.[A203636] As miconazole is typically applied topically and is minimally absorbed into the systemic circulation following application, the majority of patient reactions are limited to hypersensitivity and cases of anaphylaxis.[L14021] Patients using intravaginal miconazole products are advised not to rely on contraceptives to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, as well as not to use tampons concurrently.[L14027]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Insulin promotes glucose and amino acid uptake into muscle and adipose tissues, and other tissues except brain and liver. It also has an anabolic role in stimulating glycogen, fatty acid, and protein synthesis. Insulin inhibits gluconeogenesis in the liver.

Insulin binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor is able to autophosphorylate and phosphorylate numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. These activated proteins, in turn, lead to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt.

Thiocolchicoside is a  skeletal muscle-relaxant drug used in the treatment of orthopedic, traumatic and rheumatologic disorders [L1661]. It is indicated as an adjuvant drug in the treatment of painful muscle contractures and is indicated in acute spinal pathology, for adults and adolescents 16 years of age and older [L1658].

Thiocolchicoside has a selective and potent afﬁnity for g-aminobutyric acid A (GABA-A) receptors and acts on muscular contractures by activating the GABA inhibitory pathways thereby behaving as a potent muscle relaxant [L1661].  Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human cortex [A18424].  GABAergic neurons are involved in myorelaxation, anxiolytic treatment, sedation, and anesthetics. GABA can also modulate heart rate and blood pressure.



It also has an affinity for the inhibitory glycine receptors (i.e., have glycomimetic and GABA mimetic activity), therefore acts as a muscle relaxant. Glycine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter and acts as an allosteric regulator of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors. It is involved in the processing of motor and sensory data, thereby regulating movement, vision, and audition. Inhibitory neurotransmitter in spinal cord, allosteric regulator of NMDA receptors [L1663, A32122].



In one study, thiocolchicoside inhibited the function of recombinant human strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors composed of the alpha1 subunit with a potency (median inhibitory concentration of 47 microM) lower than that apparent with recombinant GABA(A) receptors. The drug also inhibited the function of human nicotinic acetylcholine receptors made of the alpha4 and beta2 subunits, however, this effect was partial and moreover only apparent at high concentrations. Thiocolchicoside demonstrated no effect on the function of 5-HT(3A) serotonin receptors [A18424].', 'Thiocholchicoside is a muscle relaxing agent that works through selective binding to the GABA-A receptor.

(1) the treatment of erectile dysfunction [A175582, L5611, F3853, F3856, F3886]; and



(2) treatment of pulmonary hypertension, where:

a) the US FDA specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO Group I) in adults to improve exercise ability and delay clinical worsening [F3850]. The delay in clinical worsening was demonstrated when sildenafil was added to background epoprostenol therapy [F3850]. Studies establishing effectiveness were short-term (12 to 16 weeks), and included predominately patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class II-III symptoms and idiopathic etiology (71%) or associated with connective tissue disease (CTD) (25%) [F3850];



b) the Canadian product monograph specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of primary pulmonary arterial hypertension (PPH) or pulmonary hypertension secondary to connective tissue disease (CTD) in adult patients with WHO functional class II or III who have not responded to conventional therapy [F3859]. In addition, improvement in exercise ability and delay in clinical worsening was demonstrated in adult patients who were already stabilized on background epoprostenol therapy [F3859]; and



c) the EMA product information specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension classified as WHO functional class II and III, to improve exercise capacity [F3883]. Efficacy has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with connective tissue disease [F3883]. The EMA label also indicates sildenafil for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years old with pulmonary arterial hypertension [F3883]. Efficacy in terms of improvement of exercise capacity or pulmonary hemodynamics has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital heart disease [F3883].', 'Sildenafil is an oral therapy for erectile dysfunction [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. In the natural setting, i.e. with sexual stimulation, it restores impaired erectile function by increasing blood flow to the penis [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].



The physiological mechanism responsible for the erection of the penis involves the release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Nitric oxide then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].



Sildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in the corpus cavernosum, where PDE5 is responsible for degradation of cGMP [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Sildenafil has a peripheral site of action on erections [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum but potently enhances the relaxant effect of NO on this tissue [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. When the NO/cGMP pathway is activated, as occurs with sexual stimulation, inhibition of PDE5 by sildenafil results in increased corpus cavernosum levels of cGMP [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Therefore sexual stimulation is required in order for sildenafil to produce its intended beneficial pharmacological effects [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].



Moreover, apart from the presence of PDE5 in the corpus cavernosum of the penis, PDE5 is also present in the pulmonary vasculature [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614]. Sildenafil, therefore, increases cGMP within pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells resulting in relaxation [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614]. In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, this can lead to vasodilation of the pulmonary vascular bed and, to a lesser degree, vasodilatation in the systemic circulation [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614].', 'In vitro studies have shown that sildenafil is selective for phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Its effect is more potent on PDE5 than on other known phosphodiesterases [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. In particular, there is a 10-times selectivity over PDE6 which is involved in the phototransduction pathway in the retina [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. There is an 80-times selectivity over PDE1, and over 700-times over PDE 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. And finally, sildenafil has greater than 4,000-times selectivity for PDE5 over PDE3, the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase isoform involved in the control of cardiac contractility [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



In eight double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies of patients with either organic or psychogenic erectile dysfunction, sexual stimulation resulted in improved erections, as assessed by an objective measurement of hardness and duration of erections (via the use of RigiScan®), after sildenafil administration compared with placebo [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Most studies assessed the efficacy of sildenafil approximately 60 minutes post-dose [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The erectile response, as assessed by RigiScan®, generally increased with increasing sildenafil dose and plasma concentration [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The time course of effect was examined in one study, showing an effect for up to 4 hours but the response was diminished compared to 2 hours [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



Sildenafil causes mild and transient decreases in systemic blood pressure which, in the majority of cases, do not translate into clinical effects [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg, three times a day to patients with systemic hypertension the mean change from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was a decrease of 9.4 mmHg and 9.1 mmHg respectively [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg, three times a day to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension lesser effects in blood pressure reduction were observed (a reduction in both systolic and diastolic pressure of 2 mmHg)[F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614] . At the recommended dose of 20 mg three times a day no reductions in systolic or diastolic pressure were seen [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



Single oral doses of sildenafil up to 100 mg in healthy volunteers produced no clinically relevant effects on ECG [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg three times a day to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension no clinically relevant effects on the ECG were reported either [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



In a study of the hemodynamic effects of a single oral 100 mg dose of sildenafil in 14 patients with severe coronary artery disease (CAD) (> 70 % stenosis of at least one coronary artery), the mean resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased by 7 % and 6 % respectively compared to baseline [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Mean pulmonary systolic blood pressure decreased by 9% [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Sildenafil showed no effect on cardiac output and did not impair blood flow through the stenosed coronary arteries [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



Mild and transient differences in color discrimination (blue/green) were detected in some subjects using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test at 1 hour following a 100 mg dose, with no effects evident after 2 hours post-dose [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The postulated mechanism for this change in color discrimination is related to inhibition of PDE6, which is involved in the phototransduction cascade of the retina [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Sildenafil has no effect on visual acuity or contrast sensitivity. In a small size placebo-controlled study of patients with documented early age-related macular degeneration (n = 9), sildenafil (single dose, 100 mg) demonstrated no significant changes in visual tests conducted (which included visual acuity, Amsler grid, color discrimination simulated traffic light, and the Humphrey perimeter and photostress test) [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Tramadol is also used off-label in the treatment of premature ejaculation.[A173986]', 'Tramadol is a centrally acting μ-opioid receptor agonist and SNRI (serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake-inhibitor) that is structurally related to [codeine] and [morphine]. Tramadol binds weakly to κ- and δ-opioid receptors and to the μ-opioid receptor with 6000-fold less affinity than morphine.[A182300]



Tramadol exists as a racemic mixture consisting of two pharmacologically active enantiomers that both contribute to its analgesic property through different mechanisms: (+)-tramadol and its primary metabolite (+)-O-desmethyl-tramadol (M1) are agonists of the μ opioid receptor while (+)-tramadol inhibits serotonin reuptake and (-)-tramadol inhibits norepinephrine reuptake. These pathways are complementary and synergistic, improving tramadol''s ability to modulate the perception of and response to pain.[A4269] 



In animal models, M1 is up to 6 times more potent than tramadol in producing analgesia and 200 times more potent in μ-opioid binding.[L9257] 



Tramadol has also been shown to affect a number of pain modulators including alpha2-adrenoreceptors, neurokinin 1 receptors, the voltage-gated sodium channel type II alpha subunit[A183728], transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1 - also known as the capsaicin receptor)[A183734], muscarinic receptors (M1 and M3), N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (also known as the NMDA receptor or glutamate receptor)[A17158], Adenosine A1 receptors[A183761], and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.[A17159] 



In addition to the above neuronal targets, tramadol has a number of effects on inflammatory and immune mediators involved in the pain response. This includes inhibitory effects on cytokines, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), nuclear factor-κB, and glial cells as well as a change in the polarization state of M1 macrophages.[A182300]', 'Tramadol modulates the descending pain pathways within the central nervous system through the binding of parent and M1 metabolite to μ-opioid receptors and the weak inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.[A173983,A173980] 



Apart from analgesia, tramadol may produce a constellation of symptoms (including dizziness, somnolence, nausea, constipation, sweating and pruritus) similar to that of other opioids. 



**Central Nervous System**



In contrast to [morphine], tramadol has not been shown to cause histamine release. At therapeutic doses, tramadol has no effect on heart rate, left-ventricular function or cardiac index. Orthostatic hypotension has been observed.[L9257]



Tramadol produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centres. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem centres to increases in CO2 tension and to electrical stimulation. 



Tramadol depresses the cough reflex by a direct effect on the cough centre in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia.



Tramadol causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but

are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce

similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of

oxycodone overdose.[F4679]



Seizures have been reported in patients receiving tramadol within the recommended dosage range. Spontaneous post-marketing reports indicate that seizure risk is increased with doses of tramadol above the recommended range. Risk of convulsions may also increase in patients with epilepsy, those with a history of seizures

or in patients with a recognized risk for seizure (such as head trauma, metabolic disorders,

alcohol and drug withdrawal, CNS infections), or with concomitant use of other drugs known to reduce the seizure threshold.[F4679]



Tramadol can cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs (e.g., anti-depressants, migraine medications). Treatment with the serotoninergic drug should be discontinued if such events (characterized by clusters of symptoms such as hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs, mental status changes including confusion, irritability, extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma) occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated. Tramadol should not be used in combination with MAO inhibitors or serotonin-precursors (such as L-tryptophan, oxitriptan) and should be used with caution in combination with other serotonergic drugs (triptans, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lithium, St. John’s Wort) due to the risk of serotonin syndrome.[F4679]



**Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle**



Tramadol causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.[F4679]



**Endocrine System**



Opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal or -gonadal axes. Some changes that can be seen include an increase in serum prolactin and decreases in plasma cortisol and testosterone. Clinical signs and symptoms may be manifest from these hormonal changes.[F4679]



Hyponatremia has been reported very rarely with the use of tramadol, usually in patients with predisposing risk factors, such as elderly patients and/or patients using concomitant medications that may cause hyponatremia (e.g., antidepressants, benzodiazepines, diuretics). In some reports, hyponatremia appeared to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) and resolved with discontinuation of tramadol and appropriate treatment (e.g., fluid restriction). During tramadol treatment, monitoring for signs and symptoms of hyponatremia is recommended for patients with predisposing risk factors.[F4679]



**Cardiovascular**



Tramadol administration may result in severe hypotension in patients whose ability to maintain adequate blood pressure is compromised by reduced blood volume, or concurrent administration of drugs such as phenothiazines and other tranquillizers, sedative/hypnotics, tricyclic antidepressants or general anesthetics. These patients should be monitored for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of tramadol.[F4679]



**QTc-Interval Prolongation**



The maximum placebo-adjusted mean change from baseline in the QTcF interval was 5.5 ms in the 400 mg/day treatment arm and 6.5 ms in the 600 mg/day mg treatment arm, both occurring at the 8h time point. Both treatment groups were within the 10 ms threshold for QT prolongation. Post-marketing experience with the use of tramadol containing products included rare reports of QT prolongation reported with an overdose. Particular care should be exercised when administering tramadol to patients who are suspected to be at an increased risk of experiencing torsade de pointes during treatment with a QTc-prolonging drug.[F4679]



**Abuse and Misuse**



Like all opioids, tramadol has the potential for abuse and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Therefore, tramadol should be prescribed and handled with caution.[F4679]



**Dependence/Tolerance**



Physical dependence and tolerance reflect the neuroadaptation of the opioid receptors to chronic exposure to an opioid and are separate and distinct from abuse and addiction. Tolerance, as well as physical dependence, may develop upon repeated administration of opioids, and are not by themselves evidence of an addictive disorder or abuse. Patients on prolonged therapy should be tapered gradually from the drug if it is no longer required for pain control.

Such interaction has been reported in a study that investigated the effects of neuronal outgrowth induced by beta amyloid peptides; while amyloid peptides cause lipid disorganization within the cell membranes leading to neuronal death, piracetam demonstrated to decrease the destabilizing effects of amyloid peptide [A31534]. The authors suggest that piracetam induces a positive curvature of the membrane by occupying the polar groups in the phospholipids to counteract the negative curvature induced by amyloid peptides , which in turn would decrease the likelihood of membrane fusion [A31532]. This mechanism of action is thought to improve membrane stability, allowing the membrane and transmembrane proteins to maintain and recover the three-dimensional structure or folding for normal function [L1124] such as membrane transport, chemical secretion, and receptor binding and stimulation [A31532]. 



Through restored membrane fluidity, piracetam promotes restored neurotransmission such as glutamatergic and cholinergic systems, enhances neuroplasticity and mediates neuroprotective and anticonvulsant effects at the neuronal level [A31532]. It is also demonstrated that piracetam also improves the fluidity of platelet membranes. At the vascular level, piracetam decreases adhesion of erythrocytes to cell wall and reduces vasospasm which in turn improves microcirculation including cerebral and renal blood flow [A31532]. ', 'Piracetam is known to mediate various pharmacodynamic actions:



**Neuronal effects**: 



Piracetam modulates the cholinergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic, and glutamatergic neurotransmission although the drug does not display high affinity to any of the associated receptors (Ki >10μM). Instead, piracetam increases the density of postsynaptic receptors and/or restore the function of these receptors through stabilizing the membrane fluidity [A31532]. In the forebrain of aging mice, the density of NMDA receptors was increased by approximately 20% following 14 days of piracetam treatment. Based on the findings of various animal and human studies, the cognitive processses including learning, memory, attention and consciousness were enhanced from piracetam therapy without inducing sedation and psychostimulant effects [L1125]. Piracetam mediate neuroprotective effects against hypoxia-induced damage, intoxication, and electroconvulsive therapy [L1125]. 



In two studies involving alcohol-treated rats with evidences of withdrawal-related neuronal loss, piracetam was shown to reduce the extent of neuronal loss and increase the numbers of synapses in the hippocampus by up to 20% relative to alcohol-treated or alcohol-withdrawn rats [A31532]. This suggests that piracetam is capable in promoting neuroplasticity when recoverable neural circuits are present [A31532]. Although the mechanism of action is not fully understood, administration of piracetam prior to a convulsant stimulus reduces the seizure severity and enhances the anticonvulsant effectiveness of conventional antiepileptics such as carbamazepine and diazepam [A31535]. 



**Vascular effects**: 



Piracetam is shown to increase the deformability of erythrocytes, reduce platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent manner, reduce the adhesion of erythrocytes to vascular endothelium and capillary vasospasm. In healthy volunteers, piracetam mediated a direct stimulant effect on prostacycline synthesis and reduced the plasma levels of fibrinogen and von Willebrand’s factors (VIII: C; VIII R: AG; VIII R: vW) by 30 to 40% [L1125].

Progesterone receptor (PR) is a member of the nuclear/steroid hormone receptor (SHR) family of ligand-dependent transcription factors that is expressed primarily in female reproductive tissue as well as the central nervous system. As a result of its binding its associated steroid hormone, progesterone, the progesterone receptor (PR) modulates the expression of genes that regulate the development, differentiation, and proliferation of target tissues [A175666]. In humans, PR is found to be highly expressed in the stromal (connective tissue) cells during the secretory phase and during pregnancy [A175651]. 



Progesterone may prevent pregnancy by changing the consistency of cervical mucus to be unfavorable for sperm penetration, and by inhibiting follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which normally causes ovulation.  With perfect use, the first-year failure rate for progestin-only oral contraceptives is approximately 0.5%. The typical failure rate, however, is estimated to be approximately 5%, due to late or missed pills [F3904].', 'Progesterone, depending on concentration and dosage form, and timing of exposure may have several pharmacodynamic effects.  These actions, according, to various preparations, are listed below:



General effects



Progesterone is the main hormone of the corpus luteum and the placenta. It acts on the uterus by changing the proliferative phase to the secretory phase of the endometrium (inner mucous lining of the uterus).   This hormone, stimulated by a hormone called _luteinizing hormone_ (LH) is the main hormone during the secretory phase to prepare the corpus luteum and the endometrium for implantation of a fertilized ovum. As the luteal phase concludes, the progesterone hormone sends negative feedback to the anterior pituitary gland in the brain to decrease FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and LH (luteinizing hormone) levels. This prevents ovulation and maturation of oocytes (immature egg cells). The endometrium then prepares for pregnancy by increasing its vascularity (blood vessels) and stimulating mucous secretion. This process occurs by progesterone stimulating the endometrium to decrease endometrial proliferation, leading to a decreased uterine lining thickness, developing more complex uterine glands, collecting energy in the form of glycogen, and providing more uterine blood vessel surface area suitable for supporting a growing embryo. As opposed to cervical mucous changes observed during the proliferative phase and ovulation, progesterone decreases and thickens the cervical mucus, rendering it less elastic. This change occurs because the fertilization time period has passed, and a specific consistency of mucous amenable to sperm entry is no longer required [T490].



**Gelatinized capsules**



Progesterone capsules are an oral dosage form of micronized progesterone which, chemically identical to progesterone of ovarian origin. Progesterone capsules have all the properties of endogenous progesterone with induction of a secretory phase endometrium with gestagenic, antiestrogenic, slightly antiandrogenic and anti-aldosterone effects [F3913]. Progesterone opposes the effects of estrogen on the uterus, and is beneficial in women with unopposed estrogen exposure, which carries an increased risk of malignancy [F3913].





**Vaginal gel and vaginal insert**



 The gel preparation mimics the effects of naturally occurring progesterone. In the presence of adequate levels of estrogen, progesterone converts a proliferative endometrium into secretory endometrium. This means that the endometrium changes from a growing and thickening stage into a subsequent preparation stage for pregnancy, which involves further preparatory changes. Progesterone is necessary for the development of decidual tissue (specialized tissue amenable to supporting a possible pregnancy). Progesterone is required to increase endometrial receptivity for the implantation of a fertilized embryo. Once an embryo is implanted, progesterone helps to maintain the pregnancy [F3898]. 





**Injection (intramuscular)**



 Intramuscularly injected progesterone increases serum progesterone and aids in the prevention of endometrial tissue overgrowth due to unopposed estrogen (which leads to abnormal uterine bleeding and sometimes uterine cancer) [L5638], [F3916]. In the absence or deficiency of progesterone, the endometrium continually proliferates, eventually outgrowing its limited blood supply, shedding incompletely, and leading to abnormal and/or profuse bleeding as well as malignancy [L5638].



**Tablets, contraceptive**



Progesterone-only contraceptive tablets prevent conception by suppressing ovulation in about half of users, causing a thickening of cervical mucus to inhibit sperm movement, lowering the midcycle LH and FSH hormone peaks, slowing the movement of the ovum through the fallopian tubes, and causing secretory changes in the endometrium as described above [F3904].', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Penile erection during sexual stimulation is caused by increased penile blood flow resulting from the relaxation of penile arteries and corpus cavernosal smooth muscle. This response is mediated by the release of nitric oxide (NO) from nerve terminals and endothelial cells, which stimulates the synthesis of cyclic GMP in smooth muscle cells. Cyclic GMP causes smooth muscle relaxation and increased blood flow into the corpus cavernosum. The tissue concentration of cyclic GMP is regulated by both the rates of synthesis and degradation via phosphodiesterases (PDEs), and the most abundant PDE in the human corpus cavernosum is PDE5. Therefore, the inhibition of PDE5 by vardenafil enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cyclic GMP.[L45563]', 'Vardenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), an enzyme responsible for the degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum.

**Important note regarding use of the extended-release formulation [F4405]**



In the setting of acute myocardial infarction, or before percutaneous interventions, the extended-release form of acetylsalicylic acid should not be used. Use immediate-release formulations in scenarios requiring rapid onset of action [Label, F4405]. The extended-release form is taken to decrease the incidence of mortality and myocardial infarction (MI) for individuals diagnosed with chronic coronary artery disease (CAD), including patients with previous myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina or with chronic stable angina. Additionally, the extended-release form is used to decrease the risk of death and recurrent episodes of stroke in patients with a history of stroke or TIA [F4405].





 ', 'Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) blocks prostaglandin synthesis. It is non-selective for COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes [A177241, A10989, A32682]. Inhibition of COX-1 results in the inhibition of platelet aggregation for about 7-10 days (average platelet lifespan). The acetyl group of acetylsalicylic acid binds with a serine residue of the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) enzyme, leading to irreversible inhibition. This prevents the production of pain-causing prostaglandins. This process also stops the conversion of arachidonic acid to thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which is a potent inducer of platelet aggregation [FDA label].  Platelet aggregation can result in clots and harmful venous and arterial thromboembolism, leading to conditions such as pulmonary embolism and stroke. 



It is important to note that there is 60% homology between the protein structures of COX-1 and COX-2. ASA binds to serine 516 residue on the active site of COX-2 in the same fashion as its binding to the serine 530 residue located on the active site of COX-1. The active site of COX-2 is, however, slightly larger than the active site of COX-1, so that arachidonic acid (which later becomes prostaglandins) manages to bypass the aspirin molecule inactivating COX-2 [A32682, A177256].  ASA, therefore, exerts more action on the COX-1 receptor rather than on the COX-2 receptor [A177268]. A higher dose of acetylsalicylic acid is required for COX-2 inhibition [A177325]. ', '**Effects on pain and fever**



Acetylsalicylic acid disrupts the production of prostaglandins throughout the body by targeting cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) [A177241, A10989, A32682]. Prostaglandins are potent, irritating substances that have been shown to cause headaches and pain upon injection into humans.  Prostaglandins increase the sensitivity of pain receptors and substances such as histamine and bradykinin. Through the disruption of the production and prevention of release of prostaglandins in inflammation, this drug may stop their action at pain receptors, preventing symptoms of pain. Acetylsalicylic acid is considered an antipyretic agent because of its ability to interfere with the production of brain prostaglandin E1. Prostaglandin E1 is known to be an extremely powerful fever-inducing agent [FDA label]. 



**Effects on platelet aggregation**



The inhibition of platelet aggregation by ASA occurs because of its interference with thromboxane A2 in platelets, caused by COX-1 inhibition. Thromboxane A2 is an important lipid responsible for platelet aggregation, which can lead to clot formation and future risk of heart attack or stroke  [FDA label]. 



**A note on cancer prevention**



ASA has been studied in recent years to determine its effect on the prevention of various malignancies [A177325]. In general, acetylsalicylic acid is involved in the interference of various cancer signaling pathways, sometimes inducing or upregulating tumor suppressor genes [A177325, A177403].

The Health Canada monograph for rosuvastatin further specifies that rosuvastatin is indicated for the reduction of elevated total cholesterol (Total-C), LDL-C, ApoB, the Total-C/HDL-C ratio and triglycerides (TG) and for increasing HDL-C in hyperlipidemic and dyslipidemic conditions when response to diet and exercise alone has been inadequate. It is also indicated for the prevention of major cardiovascular events (including risk of myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and coronary artery revascularization) in adult patients without documented history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events, but with at least two conventional risk factors for cardiovascular disease.[F4652]



Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]', 'Rosuvastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A181421] Rosuvastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which increases hepatic uptake of LDL. Rosuvastatin also inhibits hepatic synthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL).[F4649] The overall effect is a decrease in plasma LDL and VLDL. 



In vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that rosuvastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] This includes improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response.



Statins have also been found to bind allosterically to β2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and in T cell activation.[A181559]



Rosuvastatin exerts an anti-inflammatory effect on rat mesenteric microvascular endothelium by attenuating leukocyte rolling, adherence and transmigration.[A1807] The drug also modulates nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression and reduces ischemic-reperfusion injuries in rat hearts.[A1787] Rosuvastatin increases the bioavailability of nitric oxide[A1807,A1799,A1787] by upregulating NOS[A1791] and by increasing the stability of NOS through post-transcriptional polyadenylation.[A1796] It is unclear as to how rosuvastatin brings about these effects though they may be due to decreased concentrations of mevalonic acid.', 'Rosuvastatin is a synthetic, enantiomerically pure antilipemic agent. It is used to lower total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and trigleride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, rosuvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A181087, A181406]



Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]



**Skeletal Muscle Effects**



Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. These risks can occur at any dose level, but are increased at the highest dose (40 mg). Rosuvastatin should be prescribed with caution in patients with predisposing factors for myopathy (e.g., age ≥ 65 years, inadequately treated hypothyroidism, renal impairment).



The risk of myopathy during treatment with rosuvastatin may be increased with concurrent administration of some other lipid-lowering therapies (such as [fenofibrate] or [niacin]), [gemfibrozil], [cyclosporine], [atazanavir]/[ritonavir], [lopinavir]/ritonavir, or [simeprevir].  Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin, coadministered with [colchicine], and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together.[F4649] 



Real-world data from observational studies has suggested that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]



**Liver Enzyme Abnormalities**



Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. In most cases, the elevations were transient and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. There were two cases of jaundice, for which a relationship to rosuvastatin therapy could not be determined, which resolved after discontinuation of therapy. There were no cases of liver failure or irreversible liver disease in these trials.[F4649]



**Endocrine Effects**



Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin calcium tablets. Based on clinical trial data with rosuvastatin, in some instances these increases may exceed the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.[F4649]



An in vitro study found that [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], and [pitavastatin] exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on human pancreas islet β cells, with reductions in cell viability of 32, 41, 34 and 29%, respectively, versus control]. Moreover, insulin secretion rates were decreased by 34, 30, 27 and 19%, respectively, relative to control.[A182012]



HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and lower cholesterol levels and, as such, might theoretically blunt adrenal or gonadal steroid hormone production. Rosuvastatin demonstrated no effect upon nonstimulated cortisol levels and no effect on thyroid metabolism as assessed by TSH plasma concentration. In rosuvastatin treated patients, there was no impairment of adrenocortical reserve and no reduction in plasma cortisol concentrations. Clinical studies with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have suggested that these agents do not reduce plasma testosterone concentration. The effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on male fertility have not been studied. The effects, if any, on the pituitarygonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown.[F4652]



**Cardiovascular**



Ubiquinone levels were not measured in rosuvastatin clinical trials, however significant decreases in circulating ubiquinone levels in patients treated with other statins have been observed. The clinical significance of a potential long-term statin-induced deficiency of ubiquinone has not been established. It has been reported that a decrease in myocardial ubiquinone levels could lead to impaired cardiac function in patients with borderline congestive heart failure.[F4652]



**Lipoprotein A**



In some patients, the beneficial effect of lowered total cholesterol and LDL-C levels may be partly blunted by a concomitant increase in the Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentrations. Present knowledge suggests the importance of high Lp(a) levels as an emerging risk factor for coronary heart disease. It is thus desirable to maintain and reinforce lifestyle changes in high-risk patients placed on rosuvastatin therapy.[F4652] Further studies have demonstrated statins affect Lp(a) levels differently in patients with dyslipidemia depending on their apo(a) phenotype; statins increase Lp(a) levels exclusively in patients with the low molecular weight apo(a) phenotype.[A181418]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Concurrently, as one of the most commonly utilized forms of vitamin D, cholecalciferol is also very frequently used as a supplement in individuals to maintain sufficient vitamin d levels in the body or to treat vitamin D deficiency, as well as various medical conditions that can be associated directly or indirectly with vitamin d insufficiency like osteoporosis and chronic kidney disease, among others [A176041, A176044, F4051].', 'Most individuals naturally generate adequate amounts of vitamin D through ordinary dietary intake of vitamin D (in some foods like eggs, fish, and cheese) and natural photochemical conversion of the vitamin D3 precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin via exposure to sunlight [L5689, F4027, F4042, F4048].



Conversely, vitamin D deficiency can often occur from a combination of insufficient exposure to sunlight, inadequate dietary intake of vitamin D, genetic defects with endogenous vitamin D receptor, or even severe liver or kidney disease [A243]. Such deficiency is known for resulting in conditions like rickets or osteomalacia, all of which reflect inadequate mineralization of bone, enhanced compensatory skeletal demineralization, resultant decreased calcium ion blood concentrations, and increases in the production and secretion of parathyroid hormone [A223]. Increases in parathyroid hormone stimulate the mobilization of skeletal calcium and the renal excretion of phosphorus [A223]. This enhanced mobilization of skeletal calcium leads towards porotic bone conditions [A223].



Ordinarily, while vitamin D3 is made naturally via photochemical processes in the skin, both itself and vitamin D2 can be found in various food and pharmaceutical sources as dietary supplements. The principal biological function of vitamin D is the maintenance of normal levels of serum calcium and phosphorus in the bloodstream by enhancing the efficacy of the small intestine to absorb these minerals from the diet [A223]. At the liver, vitamin D3 or D2 is hydroxylated to 25-hydroxyvitamin D and then finally to the primary active metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in the kidney via further hydroxylation [A223, A243]. This final metabolite binds to endogenous vitamin d receptors, which results in a variety of regulatory roles - including maintaining  calcium balance, the regulation of parathyroid hormone, the promotion of the renal reabsorption of calcium, increased intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus, and increased calcium and phosphorus mobilization of calcium and phosphorus from bone to plasma to maintain balanced levels of each in bone and the plasma [A223, A243].



In particular, calcitriol interacts with vitamin D receptors in the small intestine to enhance the efficiency of intestinal calcium and phosphorous absorption from about 10-15% to 30-40% and 60% increased to 80%, respectively [L5689]. Furthermore, calcitriol binds with vitamin D receptors in osteoblasts to stimulate a receptor activator of nuclear factor kB ligand (or RANKL) which subsequently interacts with receptor activator of nuclear factor kB (NFkB) on immature preosteoclasts, causing them to become mature bone-resorbing osteoclasts [L5689]. Such mature osteoclasts ultimately function in removing calcium and phosphorus from bone to maintain blood calcium and phosphorus levels [L5689]. Moreover, calcitriol also stimulates calcium reabsorption from the glomerular filtrate in the kidneys [L5689].



Additionally, it is believed that when calcitriol binds with nuclear vitamin D receptors, that this bound complex itself binds to retinoic acid X receptor (RXR) to generate a heterodimeric complex that consequently binds to specific nucleotide sequences in the DNA called vitamin D response elements [L5689]. When bound, various transcription factors attach to this complex, resulting in either up or down-regulation of the associated gene''s activity. It is thought that there may be as much as 200 to 2000 genes that possess vitamin D response elements or that are influenced indirectly to control a multitude of genes across the genome [L5689].  It is in this way that cholecalciferol is believed to function in regulating gene transcription associated with cancer risk, autoimmune disorders, and cardiovascular disease linked to vitamin D deficiency [L5689]. In fact, there has been some research to suggest calcitriol may also be able to prevent malignancies by inducing cellular maturation and inducing apoptosis and inhibiting angiogenesis, exhibit anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting foam cell formation and promoting angiogenesis in endothelial colony-forming cells in vitro, inhibit immune reactions by enhancing the transcription of endogenous antibiotics like cathelicidin and regulate the activity and differentiation of CD4+ T cells, amongst a variety of other proposed actions [L5689].   ', 'The in vivo synthesis of the predominant two biologically active metabolites of vitamin D occurs in two steps. The first hydroxylation of vitamin D3 cholecalciferol (or D2) occurs in the liver to yield 25-hydroxyvitamin D while the second hydroxylation happens in the kidneys to give 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D [F4027, F4042, F4048]. These vitamin D metabolites subsequently facilitate the active absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the small intestine, serving to increase serum calcium and phosphate levels sufficiently to allow bone mineralization [F4027, F4042, F4048]. Conversely, these vitamin D metabolites also assist in mobilizing calcium and phosphate from bone and likely increase the reabsorption of calcium and perhaps also of phosphate via the renal tubules [F4027, F4042, F4048]. There exists a period of 10 to 24 hours between the administration of cholecalciferol and the initiation of its action in the body due to the necessity of synthesis of the active vitamin D metabolites in the liver and kidneys [F4027, F4042, F4048]. It is parathyroid hormone that is responsible for the regulation of such metabolism at the level of the kidneys [F4027, F4042, F4048].', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Vestibular forms of vertigo are often accompanied by auditory dysfunctions such as hyperacusis, hearing loss, and tinnitus.[A220328] In most cases, adaptive mechanisms of the CNS lead to functional recovery after episodes of vertigo, however, syndromes such as Ménière''s disease tend to cause the recurrence of vertigo symptoms. This significantly impacts the quality of life and the ability to carry out daily activities.[A220318] 



**H1-receptor activity**



The mechanism of action of betahistine is multifactorial. Ménière''s disease is thought to result from a disruption of endolymphatic fluid homeostasis in the ear.[A220438] Betahistine mainly acts as a histamine H1-receptor agonist. The stimulation of H1-receptors in the inner ear causes a vasodilatory effect leading to increased permeability of blood vessels and a reduction in endolymphatic pressure; this action prevents the rupture of the labyrinth, which can contribute to the hearing loss associated with  Ménière''s disease. Betahistine is also purported to act by reducing the asymmetrical functioning of sensory vestibular organs and increasing vestibulocochlear blood flow, relieving symptoms of vertigo.[A220433]



**H3-receptor activity**



In addition to the above mechanisms, betahistine also acts as a histamine H3-receptor antagonist, increasing the turnover of histamine from postsynaptic histaminergic nerve receptors, subsequently leading to an increase in H1-agonist activity. H3-receptor antagonism elevates levels of neurotransmitters including serotonin in the brainstem, inhibiting the activity of vestibular nuclei, thus restoring proper balance and decreasing vertigo symptoms.[A220328]', 'Through its actions on the histamine receptors, betahistine provides relief from vertigo associated with Ménière''s disease.[A220328,A220433,L16388] ', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

', '**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].



Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].



In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].



There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].



Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].



The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. 



In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].



In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].



The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].', 'Zinc is involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of human proteins may bind zinc, in addition to hundreds of proteins that transport and traffic zinc. It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is an essential element for a proper sense of taste and smell and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations [L2211].



Studies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions [L2095]:



**Colds:** Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently [L2095].



**Wound healing:** Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements [L2095]. 



**Diahrrea**: Oral zinc supplements can reduce the symptoms of diarrhea in children with low levels of zinc, especially in cases of malnutrition [L2095].

Patients should be counseled regarding the risk of hypersensitivity reactions such as agranulocytosis and myocarditis with clozapine use.[L905] Clozapine-induced agranulocytosis, which is a reduction in the absolute neutrophil count or white blood cell count, places the patient at an increased risk for infection.[A215552,L905] Agranulocytosis is most likely to occur in the first 3-6 months of therapy, but it can still occur after years of treatment. The mechanism is thought to be a dose-independent and immune-mediated reaction against neutrophils.[A215557]  Patients are strictly monitored by lab testing (complete blood count with differential) to ensure agranulocytosis is detected and treated if it occurs.[L905] Testing is initially completed at one-week intervals but is expanded to two-week intervals at six months, and then four-week intervals at twelve months if lab results have been within an appropriate range. Monitoring parameters may change if there is any break in therapy. In Canada, the patient''s lab values are reported to the manufacturer for hematological monitoring, and in the USA, the patient''s lab values are reported to the REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program.[A215562] These programs function to notify the care provider of any significant drop in WBC/neutrophil count, or if there is a drop below a threshold level.

Current knowledge suggests that levetiracetam’s binding to synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) is a key driver of its action. SV2A is a membrane-bound protein that is found on synaptic vesicles and is ubiquitous throughout the CNS[A12546] - it appears to play a role in vesicle exocytosis[L8606,L8615] and in the modulation of synaptic transmission by increasing the available amount of secretory vesicles available for neurotransmission.[A12552] Stimulation of pre-synaptic SV2A by levetiracetam may inhibit neurotransmitter release,[A12551] but this action does not appear to affect normal neurotransmission. This has led to the suggestion that levetiracetam exclusively modulates the function of SV2A only under pathophysiological conditions.[A12546] Levetiracetam and related analogues showed a correlation between affinity for SV2A and anti-epileptic potency, further suggesting that action at this site contributes to the anti-epileptic activity of the drug.[L8606,L8615]

Progesterone is the main hormone of the corpus luteum and the placenta. It acts on the uterus by changing the proliferative phase to the secretory phase of the endometrium (inner mucous lining of the uterus).   This hormone, stimulated by a hormone called _luteinizing hormone_ (LH) is the main hormone during the secretory phase to prepare the corpus luteum and the endometrium for implantation of a fertilized ovum. As the luteal phase concludes, the progesterone hormone sends negative feedback to the anterior pituitary gland in the brain to decrease FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and LH (luteinizing hormone) levels. This prevents ovulation and maturation of oocytes (immature egg cells). The endometrium then prepares for pregnancy by increasing its vascularity (blood vessels) and stimulating mucous secretion. This process occurs by progesterone stimulating the endometrium to decrease endometrial proliferation, leading to a decreased uterine lining thickness, developing more complex uterine glands, collecting energy in the form of glycogen, and providing more uterine blood vessel surface area suitable for supporting a growing embryo. As opposed to cervical mucous changes observed during the proliferative phase and ovulation, progesterone decreases and thickens the cervical mucus, rendering it less elastic. This change occurs because the fertilization time period has passed, and a specific consistency of mucous amenable to sperm entry is no longer required [T490].



**Gelatinized capsules**



Progesterone capsules are an oral dosage form of micronized progesterone which, chemically identical to progesterone of ovarian origin. Progesterone capsules have all the properties of endogenous progesterone with induction of a secretory phase endometrium with gestagenic, antiestrogenic, slightly antiandrogenic and anti-aldosterone effects [F3913]. Progesterone opposes the effects of estrogen on the uterus, and is beneficial in women with unopposed estrogen exposure, which carries an increased risk of malignancy [F3913].





**Vaginal gel and vaginal insert**



 The gel preparation mimics the effects of naturally occurring progesterone. In the presence of adequate levels of estrogen, progesterone converts a proliferative endometrium into secretory endometrium. This means that the endometrium changes from a growing and thickening stage into a subsequent preparation stage for pregnancy, which involves further preparatory changes. Progesterone is necessary for the development of decidual tissue (specialized tissue amenable to supporting a possible pregnancy). Progesterone is required to increase endometrial receptivity for the implantation of a fertilized embryo. Once an embryo is implanted, progesterone helps to maintain the pregnancy [F3898]. 





**Injection (intramuscular)**



 Intramuscularly injected progesterone increases serum progesterone and aids in the prevention of endometrial tissue overgrowth due to unopposed estrogen (which leads to abnormal uterine bleeding and sometimes uterine cancer) [L5638], [F3916]. In the absence or deficiency of progesterone, the endometrium continually proliferates, eventually outgrowing its limited blood supply, shedding incompletely, and leading to abnormal and/or profuse bleeding as well as malignancy [L5638].



**Tablets, contraceptive**



Progesterone-only contraceptive tablets prevent conception by suppressing ovulation in about half of users, causing a thickening of cervical mucus to inhibit sperm movement, lowering the midcycle LH and FSH hormone peaks, slowing the movement of the ovum through the fallopian tubes, and causing secretory changes in the endometrium as described above [F3904].', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Concurrently, as one of the most commonly utilized forms of vitamin D, cholecalciferol is also very frequently used as a supplement in individuals to maintain sufficient vitamin d levels in the body or to treat vitamin D deficiency, as well as various medical conditions that can be associated directly or indirectly with vitamin d insufficiency like osteoporosis and chronic kidney disease, among others [A176041, A176044, F4051].', 'Most individuals naturally generate adequate amounts of vitamin D through ordinary dietary intake of vitamin D (in some foods like eggs, fish, and cheese) and natural photochemical conversion of the vitamin D3 precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin via exposure to sunlight [L5689, F4027, F4042, F4048].



Conversely, vitamin D deficiency can often occur from a combination of insufficient exposure to sunlight, inadequate dietary intake of vitamin D, genetic defects with endogenous vitamin D receptor, or even severe liver or kidney disease [A243]. Such deficiency is known for resulting in conditions like rickets or osteomalacia, all of which reflect inadequate mineralization of bone, enhanced compensatory skeletal demineralization, resultant decreased calcium ion blood concentrations, and increases in the production and secretion of parathyroid hormone [A223]. Increases in parathyroid hormone stimulate the mobilization of skeletal calcium and the renal excretion of phosphorus [A223]. This enhanced mobilization of skeletal calcium leads towards porotic bone conditions [A223].



Ordinarily, while vitamin D3 is made naturally via photochemical processes in the skin, both itself and vitamin D2 can be found in various food and pharmaceutical sources as dietary supplements. The principal biological function of vitamin D is the maintenance of normal levels of serum calcium and phosphorus in the bloodstream by enhancing the efficacy of the small intestine to absorb these minerals from the diet [A223]. At the liver, vitamin D3 or D2 is hydroxylated to 25-hydroxyvitamin D and then finally to the primary active metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in the kidney via further hydroxylation [A223, A243]. This final metabolite binds to endogenous vitamin d receptors, which results in a variety of regulatory roles - including maintaining  calcium balance, the regulation of parathyroid hormone, the promotion of the renal reabsorption of calcium, increased intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus, and increased calcium and phosphorus mobilization of calcium and phosphorus from bone to plasma to maintain balanced levels of each in bone and the plasma [A223, A243].



In particular, calcitriol interacts with vitamin D receptors in the small intestine to enhance the efficiency of intestinal calcium and phosphorous absorption from about 10-15% to 30-40% and 60% increased to 80%, respectively [L5689]. Furthermore, calcitriol binds with vitamin D receptors in osteoblasts to stimulate a receptor activator of nuclear factor kB ligand (or RANKL) which subsequently interacts with receptor activator of nuclear factor kB (NFkB) on immature preosteoclasts, causing them to become mature bone-resorbing osteoclasts [L5689]. Such mature osteoclasts ultimately function in removing calcium and phosphorus from bone to maintain blood calcium and phosphorus levels [L5689]. Moreover, calcitriol also stimulates calcium reabsorption from the glomerular filtrate in the kidneys [L5689].



Additionally, it is believed that when calcitriol binds with nuclear vitamin D receptors, that this bound complex itself binds to retinoic acid X receptor (RXR) to generate a heterodimeric complex that consequently binds to specific nucleotide sequences in the DNA called vitamin D response elements [L5689]. When bound, various transcription factors attach to this complex, resulting in either up or down-regulation of the associated gene''s activity. It is thought that there may be as much as 200 to 2000 genes that possess vitamin D response elements or that are influenced indirectly to control a multitude of genes across the genome [L5689].  It is in this way that cholecalciferol is believed to function in regulating gene transcription associated with cancer risk, autoimmune disorders, and cardiovascular disease linked to vitamin D deficiency [L5689]. In fact, there has been some research to suggest calcitriol may also be able to prevent malignancies by inducing cellular maturation and inducing apoptosis and inhibiting angiogenesis, exhibit anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting foam cell formation and promoting angiogenesis in endothelial colony-forming cells in vitro, inhibit immune reactions by enhancing the transcription of endogenous antibiotics like cathelicidin and regulate the activity and differentiation of CD4+ T cells, amongst a variety of other proposed actions [L5689].   ', 'The in vivo synthesis of the predominant two biologically active metabolites of vitamin D occurs in two steps. The first hydroxylation of vitamin D3 cholecalciferol (or D2) occurs in the liver to yield 25-hydroxyvitamin D while the second hydroxylation happens in the kidneys to give 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D [F4027, F4042, F4048]. These vitamin D metabolites subsequently facilitate the active absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the small intestine, serving to increase serum calcium and phosphate levels sufficiently to allow bone mineralization [F4027, F4042, F4048]. Conversely, these vitamin D metabolites also assist in mobilizing calcium and phosphate from bone and likely increase the reabsorption of calcium and perhaps also of phosphate via the renal tubules [F4027, F4042, F4048]. There exists a period of 10 to 24 hours between the administration of cholecalciferol and the initiation of its action in the body due to the necessity of synthesis of the active vitamin D metabolites in the liver and kidneys [F4027, F4042, F4048]. It is parathyroid hormone that is responsible for the regulation of such metabolism at the level of the kidneys [F4027, F4042, F4048].', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

The Health Canada monograph for rosuvastatin further specifies that rosuvastatin is indicated for the reduction of elevated total cholesterol (Total-C), LDL-C, ApoB, the Total-C/HDL-C ratio and triglycerides (TG) and for increasing HDL-C in hyperlipidemic and dyslipidemic conditions when response to diet and exercise alone has been inadequate. It is also indicated for the prevention of major cardiovascular events (including risk of myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and coronary artery revascularization) in adult patients without documented history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events, but with at least two conventional risk factors for cardiovascular disease.[F4652]



Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]', 'Rosuvastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A181421] Rosuvastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which increases hepatic uptake of LDL. Rosuvastatin also inhibits hepatic synthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL).[F4649] The overall effect is a decrease in plasma LDL and VLDL. 



In vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that rosuvastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] This includes improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response.



Statins have also been found to bind allosterically to β2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and in T cell activation.[A181559]



Rosuvastatin exerts an anti-inflammatory effect on rat mesenteric microvascular endothelium by attenuating leukocyte rolling, adherence and transmigration.[A1807] The drug also modulates nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression and reduces ischemic-reperfusion injuries in rat hearts.[A1787] Rosuvastatin increases the bioavailability of nitric oxide[A1807,A1799,A1787] by upregulating NOS[A1791] and by increasing the stability of NOS through post-transcriptional polyadenylation.[A1796] It is unclear as to how rosuvastatin brings about these effects though they may be due to decreased concentrations of mevalonic acid.', 'Rosuvastatin is a synthetic, enantiomerically pure antilipemic agent. It is used to lower total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and trigleride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, rosuvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A181087, A181406]



Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]



**Skeletal Muscle Effects**



Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. These risks can occur at any dose level, but are increased at the highest dose (40 mg). Rosuvastatin should be prescribed with caution in patients with predisposing factors for myopathy (e.g., age ≥ 65 years, inadequately treated hypothyroidism, renal impairment).



The risk of myopathy during treatment with rosuvastatin may be increased with concurrent administration of some other lipid-lowering therapies (such as [fenofibrate] or [niacin]), [gemfibrozil], [cyclosporine], [atazanavir]/[ritonavir], [lopinavir]/ritonavir, or [simeprevir].  Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin, coadministered with [colchicine], and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together.[F4649] 



Real-world data from observational studies has suggested that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]



**Liver Enzyme Abnormalities**



Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. In most cases, the elevations were transient and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. There were two cases of jaundice, for which a relationship to rosuvastatin therapy could not be determined, which resolved after discontinuation of therapy. There were no cases of liver failure or irreversible liver disease in these trials.[F4649]



**Endocrine Effects**



Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin calcium tablets. Based on clinical trial data with rosuvastatin, in some instances these increases may exceed the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.[F4649]



An in vitro study found that [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], and [pitavastatin] exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on human pancreas islet β cells, with reductions in cell viability of 32, 41, 34 and 29%, respectively, versus control]. Moreover, insulin secretion rates were decreased by 34, 30, 27 and 19%, respectively, relative to control.[A182012]



HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and lower cholesterol levels and, as such, might theoretically blunt adrenal or gonadal steroid hormone production. Rosuvastatin demonstrated no effect upon nonstimulated cortisol levels and no effect on thyroid metabolism as assessed by TSH plasma concentration. In rosuvastatin treated patients, there was no impairment of adrenocortical reserve and no reduction in plasma cortisol concentrations. Clinical studies with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have suggested that these agents do not reduce plasma testosterone concentration. The effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on male fertility have not been studied. The effects, if any, on the pituitarygonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown.[F4652]



**Cardiovascular**



Ubiquinone levels were not measured in rosuvastatin clinical trials, however significant decreases in circulating ubiquinone levels in patients treated with other statins have been observed. The clinical significance of a potential long-term statin-induced deficiency of ubiquinone has not been established. It has been reported that a decrease in myocardial ubiquinone levels could lead to impaired cardiac function in patients with borderline congestive heart failure.[F4652]



**Lipoprotein A**



In some patients, the beneficial effect of lowered total cholesterol and LDL-C levels may be partly blunted by a concomitant increase in the Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentrations. Present knowledge suggests the importance of high Lp(a) levels as an emerging risk factor for coronary heart disease. It is thus desirable to maintain and reinforce lifestyle changes in high-risk patients placed on rosuvastatin therapy.[F4652] Further studies have demonstrated statins affect Lp(a) levels differently in patients with dyslipidemia depending on their apo(a) phenotype; statins increase Lp(a) levels exclusively in patients with the low molecular weight apo(a) phenotype.[A181418]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

It is used to provide local anesthesia by nerve blockade at various sites in the body [F4349, L5930, L5948]. It does so by stabilizing the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action [F4349, L5930, L5948]. In particular, the lidocaine agent acts on sodium ion channels located on the internal surface of nerve cell membranes [F4349, L5930, L5948]. At these channels, neutral uncharged lidocaine molecules diffuse through neural sheaths into the axoplasm where they are subsequently ionized by joining with hydrogen ions [F4349, L5930, L5948]. The resultant lidocaine cations are then capable of reversibly binding the sodium channels from the inside, keeping them locked in an open state that prevents nerve depolarization [F4349, L5930, L5948]. As a result, with sufficient blockage, the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron will ultimately not depolarize and will thus fail to transmit an action potential [F4349, L5930, L5948]. This facilitates an anesthetic effect by not merely preventing pain signals from propagating to the brain but by aborting their generation in the first place [F4349, L5930, L5948].



In addition to blocking conduction in nerve axons in the peripheral nervous system, lidocaine has important effects on the central nervous system and cardiovascular system [F4349, L5930, L5948]. After absorption, lidocaine may cause stimulation of the CNS followed by depression and in the cardiovascular system, it acts primarily on the myocardium where it may produce decreases in electrical excitability, conduction rate, and force of contraction [F4349, L5930, L5948].', 'Excessive blood levels of lidocaine can cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure [F4349, L5930]. With central neural blockade these changes may be attributable to the block of autonomic fibers, a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system, and/or the beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating action of epinephrine when present [F4349, L5930]. The net effect is normally a modest hypotension when the recommended dosages are not exceeded [F4349, L5930].



In particular, such cardiac effects are likely associated with the principal effect that lidocaine elicits when it binds and blocks sodium channels, inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of electrical action potential impulses necessary to facilitate muscle contraction [F4349, L5930, L5948]. Subsequently, in cardiac myocytes, lidocaine can potentially block or otherwise slow the rise of cardiac action potentials and their associated cardiac myocyte contractions, resulting in possible effects like hypotension, bradycardia, myocardial depression, cardiac arrhythmias, and perhaps cardiac arrest or circulatory collapse [F4349, L5930, L5948].



Moreover, lidocaine possesses a dissociation constant (pKa) of 7.7 and is considered a weak base [L5948]. As a result, about 25% of lidocaine molecules will be un-ionized and available at the physiological pH of 7.4 to translocate inside nerve cells, which means lidocaine elicits an onset of action more rapidly than other local anesthetics that have higher pKa values [L5948]. This rapid onset of action is demonstrated in about one minute following intravenous injection and fifteen minutes following intramuscular injection [L5930]. The administered lidocaine subsequently spreads rapidly through the surrounding tissues and the anesthetic effect lasts approximately ten to twenty minutes when given intravenously and about sixty to ninety minutes after intramuscular injection [L5930].



Nevertheless, it appears that the efficacy of lidocaine may be minimized in the presence of inflammation [L5948]. This effect could be due to acidosis decreasing the amount of un-ionized lidocaine molecules, a more rapid reduction in lidocaine concentration as a result of increased blood flow, or potentially also because of increased production of inflammatory mediators like peroxynitrite that elicit direct actions on sodium channels [L5948].', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

A deficiency in iron indicates that the body cannot produce enough normal red blood cells.[A32514,L11800] Iron deficiency anemia occurs when body stores of iron decrease to very low levels, and the stored iron is insufficient to support normal red blood cell (RBC) production. Insufficient dietary iron, impaired iron absorption, bleeding, pregnancy, or loss of iron through the urine can lead to iron deficiency.[A32514,L11794]  Symptoms of iron deficiency anemia include fatigue, breathlessness, palpitations, dizziness, and headache.



Taking iron in supplement form, such as ferrous sulfate, allows for more rapid increases in iron levels when dietary supply and stores are not sufficient.[L2175] Iron is transported by the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) across the endolysosomal membrane to enter the macrophage. It can then can be incorporated into ferritin and be stored in the macrophage or carried of the macrophage by ferroportin. This exported iron is  oxidized by the enzyme to ceruloplasmin to Fe3+, followed by sequestration by transferrin for transport in the serum to various sites, including the bone marrow for hemoglobin synthesis or into the liver.[A32524] Iron combines with porphyrin and globin chains to form hemoglobin, which is critical for oxygen delivery from the lungs to other tissues.[L2263]', 'Ferrous sulfate replenishes iron, an essential component in hemoglobin, myoglobin, and various enzymes.

DNA gyrase is an enzyme found only in bacteria that introduces negative supercoils into DNA during replication - this helps to relieve torsional strain caused by the introduction of positive supercoils during replication, and these negative supercoils are essential for chromosome condensation and the promotion of transcription initiation.[A31453] It is comprised of four subunits (two A subunits and two B subunits) of which the A subunits appear to be the target of fluoroquinolone antibiotics.[A190663] Bacterial topoisomerase IV, in addition to contributing to the relaxation of positive supercoils, is essential at the terminal stages of DNA replication and functions to “unlink” newly replicated chromosomes to allow for the completion of cell division.[A31453]

Hyaluronic acid works by two basic mechanisms: serving as a passive structural molecule or serving as signaling molecule, depending on the molecule size. The physicochemical properties of high molecular weight HA contribute to passive structural effects, demonstrating hygroscopicity and viscoelasticity and improving hydration, water balance, and structural integrity. As a signalling  molecule interacting with proteins, HA causes several opposing effects based on molecular weight: pro- or anti-inflammatory effects, promotion or inhibition of cell migration, and activating or inhibiting cell division.[A230133] 



Hyaluronic acid exerts its therapeutic effects through binding to three primary types of cell surface receptors: CD44 (a membrane glycoprotein), the receptor for hyaluronate-mediated motility (RHAMM), and the Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1). CD44 is considered the most widely distributed receptor for hyaluronic acid, demonstrating cellular interactions with osteopontin, collagen, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).  High and low molecular weight hyaluronic acids demonstrate differing molecular and cellular mechanisms in their interaction with CD44 receptors. Some examples of these effects include modification of chondrocyte survival pathways in addition to alteration of apoptosis pathways.  Lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor (LYVE-1), and hyaluronic acid receptor for endocytosis (HARE), (also known as Stabilin-2) also bind to hyaluronic acid.[A230128] 



Hyaluronic acid for skin conditions and cosmetics



Hyaluronic acid''s anionic proprieties cause it to attract water and induce swelling, increasing tissue volume and skin structural integrity. The aging process is associated with reduced production of skin hyaluronic acid and collagen, causing the appearance of wrinkles and the loss of facial volume. Dermal fillers of hyaluronic acid replace lost tissue volume, imparting a full and youthful appearance to skin that has lost its elasticity. Hyaluronic acid fillers contain cross-linked hyaluronic acid particles, rendering a concentrated substance with resistance to various forms of physical and chemical breakdown. The cosmetic benefits of hyaluronic acid filler may last up to 6 months, depending on the brand and technique used for injection.[L32193] Additionally, dermal hyaluronic acid fillers are known to increase the production of fibroblasts[L32193], supporting wound healing and offering relief from irritating and inflammatory skin conditions.[A230118]





Hyaluronic acid for joint pain



Most cells in the human body are capable of synthesizing HA. It is a primary component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and can be found in bone marrow, cartilage, and synovial fluid in joints.[A230128] In osteoarthritis, the concentration of naturally occurring hyaluronic acid gradually decreases, lowering the viscosity of synovial fluid that protects joints from excess friction. Administration of intra-articular hyaluronic acid increases viscosity of synovial joint fluid, reducing friction and subsequently relieving painful arthritic symptoms.[L32193]





Hyaluronic acid for ophthalmic conditions and ophthalmological procedures



Solutions of hyaluronic acid with a concentration greater than 0.1% moisturize the surface of the eyes to treat symptoms of dry eye while improving the stabilization of tear film, replenishing deficiencies of HA, reducing friction, and preventing binding of foreign substances to the ocular tissue.[A230128,L32193] Hyaluronic acid is frequently used during and after ophthalmological surgeries and plays important roles by virtue of its moisturizing, viscoelastic, and protective properties. It promotes tissue healing of the corneal epithelium and other parts of the eye following ophthalmological surgery, minimizing the risk of adhesions and free radical formation.[A230128]

', 'HA has long-acting lubricant, shock absorbing, joint stabilizing, and water balancing properties.[A230128,L32193] It is similar to the naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan (GAG) in joints. Hyaluronic acid works by acting as a lubricant and shock absorber, facilitating joint mobility and thereby reducing osteoarthritic pain.  Hyaluronic acid has antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic effects.[A230128] The water-balancing properties and viscoelasticity of hyaluronic acid are beneficial in cosmetic injections, imparting volume and reducing the appearance of imperfections and wrinkles.[L32193] Due to the abovementioned properties, HA has a protective effect on the eyes and cornea.[A230133]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

As a member of the VEGF family, VEGF-A is a key regulator of vascular permeability and angiogenesis;[A2301] thus, it has been studied as a therapeutic target for the treatment of a wide array of neovascular eye diseases, including neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy.[L38978] For example, increased VEGF-A levels in the vitreous were shown in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration.[A11475]



Ranibizumab is a recombinant humanized IgG1 kappa isotype monoclonal antibody directed against human VEGF-A.[A11475] Ranibizumab binds to VEGF-A with high affinity as well as its biologically active forms, such as VEGF165, VEGF121, and VEGF110.[A246394] Notably, VEGF165 is the most predominant isoform in the human eye that promotes ocular neovascularization. VEGF165 enhances vascular permeability, inhibits apoptosis, and causes endothelial-cell mobilization from the bone marrow and differentiation for angiogenesis.[A2301] Ranibizumab binds to the receptor-binding site of VEGF-A, preventing it from binding to its receptors - VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 - that are expressed on the surface of endothelial cells. Ranibizumab thereby attenuates endothelial cell proliferation, vascular leakage, and new blood vessel formation.[L38978]', 'Ranibizumab is a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) inhibitor used to manage ocular diseases with abnormal angiogenesis. It inhibits the formation of new blood vessels or neovascularization.[A246399] Ultimately, ranibizumab works to slow down the loss of vision and causes significant visual improvement in patients with ocular degenerative disorders, such as age-related macular degeneration.[A11475] It can also reduce retinal thickness.[L38978]



As ranibizumab has one binding site for VEGF, two drug molecules bind to one VEGF dimer.[A246399] Ranibizumab lacks the Fc region of an antibody, which may prevent the drug from causing intraocular inflammation following intravitreal injection.[A11475]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

1) Secondary prevention of stroke and transient ischemic attacks in patients with rheumatic mitral valve disease but without atrial fibrillation.[A179182]', 'Warfarin is a [vitamin K] antagonist which acts to inhibit the production of vitamin K by vitamin K epoxide reductase.[label,A179221,T116] The reduced form of vitamin K, vitamin KH<sub>2</sub> is a cofactor used in the γ-carboxylation of coagulation factors VII, IX, X, and thrombin. Carboxylation induces a conformational change allowing the factors to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> and to phospholipid surfaces. Uncarboxylated factors VII, IX, X, and thrombin are biologically inactive and therefore serve to interrupt the coagulation cascade. The endogenous anticoagulation proteins C and S also require  γ-carboxylation to function. This is particularly true in the case of thrombin which must be activated in order to form a thrombus. vitamin KH<sub>2</sub> is converted to vitamin K epoxide as part of the γ-carboxylation reaction catalyzed by γ-glutamyl carboxylase. Vitamin K epoxide is then converted to vitamin K<sub>1</sub> by vitamin K epoxide reductase then back to vitamin KH<sub>2</sub> by vitamin K reductase. Warfarin binds to vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 and irreversibly inhibits the enzyme thereby stopping the recycling of vitamin K by preventing the conversion of vitamin K epoxide to vitamin K<sub>1</sub>. This process creates a hypercoagulable state for a short time as proteins C and S degrade first with half lives of 8 and 24 hours, with the exception of factor VII which has a half life of 6 hours.[A179221] Factors IX, X, and finally thrombin degrade later with half lives of 24, 36, and 50 hours resulting in a dominant anticoagulation effect.[A179221] In order to reverse this anticoagulation vitamin K must be supplied, either exogenously or by removal of the vitamin K epoxide reductase inhibition, and time allowed for new coagulation factors to be synthesized.[label,A179221,T116] It takes approximately 2 days for new coagulation factors to be synthesized in the liver. Vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, functionally identical to vitamin K<sub>1</sub>, is synthesized by gut bacteria leading to interactions with antibiotics as elimination of these bacteria can reduce vitamin K<sub>2</sub supply and result in a greater anticoagulation effect.[T116]', 'Warfarin is an anticoagulant, as such it disrupts the coagulation cascade to reduce frequency and extent of thrombus formation.[label,L6616] In patients with deep vein thrombosis or atrial fibrillation there is an increased risk of thrombus formation due to the reduced movement of blood.[T622] For patients with cardiac valve disease or valve replacements this increased coagulability is due to tissue damage. Thrombi due to venous thrombosis can travel to the lungs and become pulmonary emboli, blocking circulation to a portion of lung tissue. Thrombi which form in the heart can travel to the brain and cause ischemic strokes. Prevention of these events is the primary goal of warfarin therapy.



Limitation of thrombus formation is also a source of adverse effects. In patients with atheroscelotic plaques rupture typically results in thrombus formation.[A179212] When these patients are anticoagulated plaque rupture can allow the escape of cholesterol from the lipid core in the form of atheroemboli or cholesterol microemboli. These emboli are smaller than thrombi and block smaller vessels, usually less than 200 μm in diameter. The consequences of this are varied and depend on the location of the blockage. Effects include visual disturbances, acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease, central nervous system ischemia, and purple or blue toe syndrome.[label,A179212] Blue toe syndrome can be reversed if it has not progressed to tissue necrosis but the other effects of microemboli are often permanent.



Antocoagulation appears to mediate warfarin-related nephropathy, a seemingly spontaneous kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease associated with warfarin therapy.[A179215] Nephropathy in this case appears to be due to increased passage of red blood cells through the glomerulus and subsequent blockage of renal tubules with red blood cell casts. This is worsened or possibly triggered by pre-existing kidney damage. Increased risk of warfarin-related nephropathy occurs at INRs over 3.0 but risk does not increase as a function of INR beyond this point.



Warfarin has been linked to the development of calciphylaxis.[label] This is thought to be due to warfarin''s inhibition of [vitamin K](VKA) recycling as VKA is needed for the carboxylation of matrix Gla protein.[A179218] This protein is an anti-calcification factor and its inhibition through preventing the carboxylation step in its production leads to a shift in calcification balance in favor of calciphylaxis. 



Tissue necrosis can occur early on in warfarin therapy.[label] This is attributable to half lives of the clotting factors impacted by inhibition of vitamin K recycling.[label,A179221] Proteins C and S are anticoagulation factors with half lives of 8 and 24 hours respectively. The coagulation factors IX, X, VII, and thrombin (factor II) have half lives of 24, 36, 6, and 50 hours respectively. This means proteins C and S are inactivated sooner than pro-coagulation proteins, with the exception of factor VII, resulting in a pro-thrombotic state for the first few days of therapy. Thrombi which form in this time period can occlude arterioles in various locations, blocking blood flow and causing tissue necrosis due to ischemia.', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

This inhibits the AT1-mediated vasoconstrictive and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II and results in an overall decrease in blood pressure. Candesartan is greater than 10,000 times more selective for AT1 than AT2. Inhibition of aldosterone secretion may increase sodium and water excretion while decreasing potassium excretion.', 'Candesartan cilexetil is an ARB prodrug that is rapidly converted to candesartan, its active metabolite, during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Candesartan confers blood pressure lowering effects by antagonizing the hypertensive effects of angiotensin II via the RAAS. RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. Renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is cleaved by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II increases blood pressure by increasing total peripheral resistance, increasing sodium and water reabsorption in the kidneys via aldosterone secretion, and altering cardiovascular structure. Angiotensin II binds to two receptors: type-1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1) and type-2 angiotensin II receptor (AT2). AT1 is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that mediates the vasoconstrictive and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II. Studies performed in recent years suggest that AT2 antagonizes AT1-mediated effects and directly affects long-term blood pressure control by inducing vasorelaxation and increasing urinary sodium excretion. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are non-peptide competitive inhibitors of AT1. ARBs block the ability of angiotensin II to stimulate pressor and cell proliferative effects. Unlike ACE inhibitors, ARBs do not affect bradykinin-induced vasodilation. The overall effect of ARBs is a decrease in blood pressure.', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

(2) treatment of pulmonary hypertension, where:

a) the US FDA specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO Group I) in adults to improve exercise ability and delay clinical worsening [F3850]. The delay in clinical worsening was demonstrated when sildenafil was added to background epoprostenol therapy [F3850].

The EMA label also indicates sildenafil for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years old with pulmonary arterial hypertension [F3883]. Efficacy in terms of improvement of exercise capacity or pulmonary hemodynamics has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital heart disease [F3883].', 'Sildenafil is an oral therapy for erectile dysfunction [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. In the natural setting, i.e. with sexual stimulation, it restores impaired erectile function by increasing blood flow to the penis [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].



The physiological mechanism responsible for the erection of the penis involves the release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Nitric oxide then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].



Sildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in the corpus cavernosum, where PDE5 is responsible for degradation of cGMP [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Sildenafil has a peripheral site of action on erections [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum but potently enhances the relaxant effect of NO on this tissue [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. When the NO/cGMP pathway is activated, as occurs with sexual stimulation, inhibition of PDE5 by sildenafil results in increased corpus cavernosum levels of cGMP [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Therefore sexual stimulation is required in order for sildenafil to produce its intended beneficial pharmacological effects [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].



Moreover, apart from the presence of PDE5 in the corpus cavernosum of the penis, PDE5 is also present in the pulmonary vasculature [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614]. Sildenafil, therefore, increases cGMP within pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells resulting in relaxation [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614]. In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, this can lead to vasodilation of the pulmonary vascular bed and, to a lesser degree, vasodilatation in the systemic circulation [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614].', 'In vitro studies have shown that sildenafil is selective for phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Its effect is more potent on PDE5 than on other known phosphodiesterases [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. In particular, there is a 10-times selectivity over PDE6 which is involved in the phototransduction pathway in the retina [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. There is an 80-times selectivity over PDE1, and over 700-times over PDE 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. And finally, sildenafil has greater than 4,000-times selectivity for PDE5 over PDE3, the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase isoform involved in the control of cardiac contractility [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



In eight double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies of patients with either organic or psychogenic erectile dysfunction, sexual stimulation resulted in improved erections, as assessed by an objective measurement of hardness and duration of erections (via the use of RigiScan®), after sildenafil administration compared with placebo [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Most studies assessed the efficacy of sildenafil approximately 60 minutes post-dose [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The erectile response, as assessed by RigiScan®, generally increased with increasing sildenafil dose and plasma concentration [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The time course of effect was examined in one study, showing an effect for up to 4 hours but the response was diminished compared to 2 hours [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



Sildenafil causes mild and transient decreases in systemic blood pressure which, in the majority of cases, do not translate into clinical effects [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg, three times a day to patients with systemic hypertension the mean change from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was a decrease of 9.4 mmHg and 9.1 mmHg respectively [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg, three times a day to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension lesser effects in blood pressure reduction were observed (a reduction in both systolic and diastolic pressure of 2 mmHg)[F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614] . At the recommended dose of 20 mg three times a day no reductions in systolic or diastolic pressure were seen [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



Single oral doses of sildenafil up to 100 mg in healthy volunteers produced no clinically relevant effects on ECG [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg three times a day to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension no clinically relevant effects on the ECG were reported either [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



In a study of the hemodynamic effects of a single oral 100 mg dose of sildenafil in 14 patients with severe coronary artery disease (CAD) (> 70 % stenosis of at least one coronary artery), the mean resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased by 7 % and 6 % respectively compared to baseline [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Mean pulmonary systolic blood pressure decreased by 9% [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Sildenafil showed no effect on cardiac output and did not impair blood flow through the stenosed coronary arteries [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



Mild and transient differences in color discrimination (blue/green) were detected in some subjects using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test at 1 hour following a 100 mg dose, with no effects evident after 2 hours post-dose [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The postulated mechanism for this change in color discrimination is related to inhibition of PDE6, which is involved in the phototransduction cascade of the retina [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Sildenafil has no effect on visual acuity or contrast sensitivity. In a small size placebo-controlled study of patients with documented early age-related macular degeneration (n = 9), sildenafil (single dose, 100 mg) demonstrated no significant changes in visual tests conducted (which included visual acuity, Amsler grid, color discrimination simulated traffic light, and the Humphrey perimeter and photostress test) [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Hydrocarbons are capable of partitioning into the cell and cytoplasmic membrane of microorganisms and disrupt their vital functions, which may result in leakage of ions such as potassium, and the inhibition of respiration [A32439]. Eventually, cell lysis may occur due to weakening of the cell wall, and loss of turgor pressure and subsequent rupture of the cytoplasmic membrane [A32441]. The loss of 260-nm-absorbing material may be indicative of a damaged cytoplasmic membrane and loss of nucleic acids [A32441]. In _E. coli_, perturbed potassium homeostasis, glucose-dependent respiration, cell morphology, and ability to exclude propidium iodide was observed. 



Tea tree oil also mediates its antifungal actions in a similar way, where it alters the permeability of Candida albicans and inhibits its respiration in a dose-dependent manner [A32439]. Plasma and mitochondrial membranes of fungal species are also thought to be negatively affected by inhibition of glucose-induced medium acidification by tea tree oil, which involves inhibition of membrane ATPase responsible for the expulsion of protons [A32439]. Tea tree oil also inhibits the formation of germ tubes, or mycelial conversion, in _C. albicans_, thereby disrupting cell morphogenesis [A32439]. Water-soluble fraction of TTO, terpinen-4-ol, and α-terpineol, can inhibit the lipopolysaccharide-induced production of the inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-10 by human peripheral monocytes by approximately 50% and that of prostaglandin E2 by about 30% after 40 h [A32439].

It is indicated as an intervention alternative in individuals presenting dyslipidemia at risk of developing atherosclerotic vascular disease. The administration of this agent should be accompanied by the implementation of a fat and cholesterol-restricted diet.[F4661]



Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be a component of multiple risk factor intervention in those individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Lovastatin is indicated as an adjunct to diet for the reduction of elevated total-C and LDL-C levels in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (Types IIa and IIb2), when the response to diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and to other nonpharmacological measures alone has been inadequate.[F4661,F4664]



Lovastatin is also indicated to slow the progression of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with coronary heart disease as part of a treatment strategy to lower total-C and LDL-C to target levels.[F4661]



Lovastatin is indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce total-C, LDL-C and apolipoprotein B levels in adolescent boys and girls with Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) who are at least one year post-menarche, 10 to 17 years of age, with HeFH if after an adequate trial of diet therapy the following findings are present: LDL-C remains greater than 189 mg/dL or LDL-C remains greater than 160 mg/dL and there is a positive family history of premature cardiovascular disease or two or more other CVD risk factors are present in the adolescent patient.



Before administering lovastatin, it is important to rule out the presence of secondary causes of hypercholesterolemia and a lipid profile should be performed.



Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]', 'Lovastatin is a lactone which is readily hydrolyzed _in vivo_ to the corresponding β-hydroxyacid and strong inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, a hepatic microsomal enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A ) to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A181421,A174553] At therapeutic lovastatin doses, HMG-CoA reductase is not completely blocked, thereby allowing biologically necessary amounts of mevalonate to be available. Because the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate is an early step in the biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol, therapy with lovastatin would not be expected to cause an accumulation of potentially toxic sterols.[F4664]



Lovastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which increase hepatic uptake of LDL. Lovastatin also inhibits hepatic synthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). The overall effect is a decrease in plasma LDL and VLDL and a significant reduction in the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475]



A significant effect on LDL-C reduction was seen within 2 weeks of initiation of lovastatin, and the maximum therapeutic response occurred within 4-6 weeks. The response was maintained during continuation of therapy. Single daily doses given in the evening were more effective than the same dose given in the morning, perhaps because cholesterol is synthesized mainly at night. When therapy with lovastatin is stopped, total cholesterol has been shown to return to pre-treatment levels.[F4664]



In vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that lovastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] This includes improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response.



Statins have also been found to bind allosterically to β2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and in T cell activation.[A181559]



Lovastatin has been reported to have beneficial effects on certain cancers. This includes a multi-factorial stress-triggered cell death (apoptosis) and DNA degradation response in breast cancer cells.[A181937] It has also been shown to inhibit histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) activity and increase the accumulation of acetylated histone-H3 and the expression of p21(WAF/CIP) in human cancer cells, suggesting that statins might serve as novel HDAC inhibitors for cancer therapy and chemoprevention.[A15235]', 'Lovastatin is an oral antilipemic agent which reversibly inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. It is used to lower total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and trigleride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, lovastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A174580,A181087,A181406,A181925]



Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A174580,A181397,A181403] Clinical studies have shown that lovastatin reduces LDL-C and total cholesterol by 25-40%.[A174580] The 50% inhibitory dose is known to be of 46 mcg/kg which is translated into a reduction of approximately 30% of plasma cholesterol.[A174553]



**Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis**



Lovastatin, like other inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, occasionally causes myopathy manifested as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness with creatine kinase (CK) above ten times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Myopathy sometimes takes the form of rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria, and rare fatalities have occurred. The risk of myopathy is dose-related and is increased by high levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity in plasma. In a clinical study (EXCEL)[A181925] in which patients were carefully monitored and some interacting drugs were excluded, there was one case of myopathy among 4933 patients randomized to lovastatin 20 to 40 mg daily for 48 weeks, and 4 among 1649 patients randomized to 80 mg daily.



Predisposing factors for myopathy include advanced age (≥65 years), female gender, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. Chinese patients may also be at increased risk for myopathy. In most cases, muscle symptoms and CK increases resolved when treatment was promptly discontinued.



The risk of myopathy during treatment with lovastatin may be increased with concurrent administration of interacting drugs such as [fenofibrate], [niacin], [gemfibrozil], [cyclosporine], and strong inhibitors of the CYP3A4 enzyme.  Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors coadministered with [colchicine], and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together.[F4661,F4664]



Real-world data from observational studies has suggested that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]



**Liver Dysfunction**



Persistent increases (to more than 3 times the upper limit of normal) in serum transaminases occurred in 1.9% of adult patients who received lovastatin for at least one year in early clinical trials. When the drug was interrupted or discontinued in these patients, the transaminase levels usually fell slowly to pretreatment levels. The increases usually appeared 3 to 12 months after the start of therapy with lovastatin, and were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms.[F4661] In the EXCEL study,[A181925] the incidence of persistent increases in serum transaminases over 48 weeks was 0.1% for placebo, 0.1% at 20 mg/day, 0.9% at 40 mg/day, and 1.5% at 80 mg/day in patients on lovastatin. However, in post-marketing experience with lovastatin, symptomatic liver disease has been reported rarely at all dosages.[F4661]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

It is used to lower total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and trigleride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, rosuvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A181087, A181406]



Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]



**Skeletal Muscle Effects**



Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. These risks can occur at any dose level, but are increased at the highest dose (40 mg). Rosuvastatin should be prescribed with caution in patients with predisposing factors for myopathy (e.g., age ≥ 65 years, inadequately treated hypothyroidism, renal impairment).



The risk of myopathy during treatment with rosuvastatin may be increased with concurrent administration of some other lipid-lowering therapies (such as [fenofibrate] or [niacin]), [gemfibrozil], [cyclosporine], [atazanavir]/[ritonavir], [lopinavir]/ritonavir, or [simeprevir].  Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin, coadministered with [colchicine], and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together.[F4649] 



Real-world data from observational studies has suggested that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]



**Liver Enzyme Abnormalities**



Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. In most cases, the elevations were transient and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. There were two cases of jaundice, for which a relationship to rosuvastatin therapy could not be determined, which resolved after discontinuation of therapy. There were no cases of liver failure or irreversible liver disease in these trials.[F4649]



**Endocrine Effects**



Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin calcium tablets. Based on clinical trial data with rosuvastatin, in some instances these increases may exceed the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.[F4649]



An in vitro study found that [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], and [pitavastatin] exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on human pancreas islet β cells, with reductions in cell viability of 32, 41, 34 and 29%, respectively, versus control]. Moreover, insulin secretion rates were decreased by 34, 30, 27 and 19%, respectively, relative to control.[A182012]



HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and lower cholesterol levels and, as such, might theoretically blunt adrenal or gonadal steroid hormone production. Rosuvastatin demonstrated no effect upon nonstimulated cortisol levels and no effect on thyroid metabolism as assessed by TSH plasma concentration. In rosuvastatin treated patients, there was no impairment of adrenocortical reserve and no reduction in plasma cortisol concentrations. Clinical studies with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have suggested that these agents do not reduce plasma testosterone concentration. The effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on male fertility have not been studied. The effects, if any, on the pituitarygonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown.[F4652]



**Cardiovascular**



Ubiquinone levels were not measured in rosuvastatin clinical trials, however significant decreases in circulating ubiquinone levels in patients treated with other statins have been observed. The clinical significance of a potential long-term statin-induced deficiency of ubiquinone has not been established. It has been reported that a decrease in myocardial ubiquinone levels could lead to impaired cardiac function in patients with borderline congestive heart failure.[F4652]



**Lipoprotein A**



In some patients, the beneficial effect of lowered total cholesterol and LDL-C levels may be partly blunted by a concomitant increase in the Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentrations. Present knowledge suggests the importance of high Lp(a) levels as an emerging risk factor for coronary heart disease. It is thus desirable to maintain and reinforce lifestyle changes in high-risk patients placed on rosuvastatin therapy.[F4652] Further studies have demonstrated statins affect Lp(a) levels differently in patients with dyslipidemia depending on their apo(a) phenotype; statins increase Lp(a) levels exclusively in patients with the low molecular weight apo(a) phenotype.[A181418]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

**Pantoprazole Injection**:



**Treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease associated with a history of erosive esophagitis**



Pantoprazole for injection is indicated for short-term treatment (7-10 days) of patients having gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with a history of erosive esophagitis, as an alternative to oral medication in patients who are unable to continue taking pantoprazole delayed-release tablets. _Safety and efficacy of pantoprazole injection as the initial treatment of patients having GERD with a history of erosive esophagitis have not been demonstrated at this time_.[FDA label]



**Pathological Hypersecretion Associated with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome**



Pantoprazole for injection is indicated for the treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions associated with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome or other neoplastic conditions.[FDA label]



**Pantoprazole delayed-release oral suspension**:



**Short-Term Treatment of erosive esophagitis associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**



Indicated in adults and pediatric patients five years of age and above for the short-term treatment (up to 8 weeks) in the healing and symptomatic relief of erosive esophagitis. For adult patients who have not healed after 8 weeks of treatment, an additional 8-week course of pantoprazole may be considered. Safety of treatment beyond 8 weeks in pediatric patients has not been determined.[F3202]



**Maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis**



Indicated for maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis and reduction in relapse rates of daytime and nighttime heartburn symptoms in adult patients with GERD.[F3202]



**Pathological hypersecretory conditions including Zollinger-Ellison syndrome**



Indicated for the long-term treatment of the above conditions.[F3202]', 'Hydrochloric acid (HCl) secretion into the gastric lumen is a process regulated mainly by the H(+)/K(+)-ATPase of the proton pump, expressed in high quantities by the parietal cells of the stomach.[A174295] ATPase is an enzyme on the parietal cell membrane that facilitates hydrogen and potassium exchange through the cell, which normally results in the extrusion of potassium and formation of HCl (gastric acid). 



Proton pump inhibitors such as pantoprazole are substituted _benzimidazole_ derivatives, weak bases, which accumulate in the acidic space of the parietal cell before being converted in the _canaliculi_  (small canal) of the gastric parietal cell, an acidic environment, to active _sulfenamide_ derivatives. This active form then makes disulfide bonds with important cysteines on the gastric acid pump, inhibiting its function.[A174247] Specifically, pantoprazole binds to the _sulfhydryl group_ of H+, K+-ATPase, which is an enzyme implicated in accelerating the final step in the acid secretion pathway. The enzyme is inactivated, inhibiting gastric acid secretion.[A174253] The inhibition of gastric acid secretion is stronger with proton pump inhibitors such as pantoprazole and lasts longer than with the H(2) antagonists.[A174295] ', 'This drug acts to decrease gastric acid secretion, which reduces stomach acidity. Pantoprazole administration leads to long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion.[F3193]



**General Effects**



Pantoprazole has been shown to reduce acid reflux-related symptoms, heal inflammation of the esophagus, and improve patient quality of life more effectively than histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2 blockers). This drug has an excellent safety profile and a low incidence of drug interactions. It can be used safely in various high-risk patient populations, including the elderly and those with renal failure or moderate hepatic dysfunction.[A174226]



Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as pantoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]



PPIs such as pantoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes [A177577, A177580]. 



**A note on laboratory testing abnormalities**



During treatment with antisecretory medicinal products such as pantoprazole, serum gastrin (a peptide hormone that stimulates secretion of gastric acid) increases in response to the decreased acid secretion caused by proton pump inhibition. The increased gastrin level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Published evidence suggests that proton pump inhibitors should be stopped 14 days before chromogranin A (CgA) measurements. This permits chromogranin A levels, that might be falsely elevated after proton pump inhibitor treatment, to return to the normal reference range.[F3217] 



Reports have been made of false-positive results in urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving the majority of proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole. A confirmatory method should be used.[F3217]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Animal research studies have demonstrated that carbamazepine exerts its effects by lowering polysynaptic nerve response and inhibiting post-tetanic potentiation. In both cats and rats, carbamazepine was shown to decrease pain caused by infraorbital nerve stimulation. A decrease in the action potential in the nucleus ventralis of the thalamus in the brain and inhibition of the lingual mandibular reflex were observed in other studies after carbamazepine use. Carbamazepine causes the above effects by binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels and preventing action potentials, which normally lead to stimulatory effects on nerves.[A180403,T634] In bipolar disorder, carbamazepine is thought to increase dopamine turnover and increase GABA transmission, treating manic and depressive symptoms.[L7216]



A common issue that has arisen is resistance to this drug in up to 30% of epileptic patients, which may occur to altered metabolism in patients with variant genotypes.[A180436] A potential therapeutic target to combat carbamazepine resistance has recently been identified as the EPHX1 gene promoter, potentially conferring resistance to carbamazepine through methylation.[A180439]', '**General effects**



Carbamazepine treats seizures and the symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia by inhibiting sodium channels.  In bipolar 1 disorder, carbamazepine has been found to decrease mania symptoms in a clinically significant manner according to the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS).[L1335] Carbamazepine has a narrow therapeutic index.[A180301]

In the official labeling, the use of palbociclib should be accompanied with either an aromatase inhibition, no restricted to letrozole, as initial endocrine-based therapy in postmenopausal women or in man.[L48076]



The breast cancer starts as a group of cancer cells that grow into and destroy the nearby breast tissue. This growth can spread into other parts of the body which is called metastasis. According to the location of the cancer cells, it can be categorized in ductal carcinoma and lobular carcinoma. However, other types of breast cancer include inflammatory breast cancer, Paget disease of the breast, triple negative breast cancer non-Hodgkin lymphoma and soft tissue sarcoma.[L5870] In males, breast cancer is usually treated as the cases of postmenopausal women and almost all the cases are ductal carcinoma.[L5873]', 'Palbociclib is a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor[A176783] that acts by binding to the ATP pocket with an IC50 in the range of 9-15 nmol/L. It is important to consider that it presents low to absent activity against other kinases.[A176798] 



The CDK4/6 kinase is involved, with coregulatory partner cyclin D, in the G1-S transition. Hence, inhibition of this step prevents cell cycle progression in cells in whose this pathway is functioning. This step includes the pathways of the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein and the E2F family of transcription factors.[A176798]', 'Due to its mechanism of action, palbociclib inhibits cell growth and suppresses DNA replication in retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene (RB) proficient cancer cells. As expected, these RB cells present a significant increase in the proportion of cells in G1 state and the presence of palbociclib produces effective dephosphorylation of RB, reduce proliferation and induce senescence causing cell-cycle arrest.[A176810]



In vitro studies showed the potential for palbociclib to reduce cellular proliferation of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell lines through the inhibition of the cell-cycle progression from G1 to S phase. In this study, it was demonstrated that the sensitivity of the cells significantly increased with the expression of _RB1_ and _CCND1_ and low expression of _CDKN2A_. As well, palbociclib, combined with antiestrogens, enhanced _in vivo_ antitumor activity in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer mouse models.[A176792]



In clinical trials, palbociclib, in combination with letrozole, was shown to significantly increase the progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with metastatic breast cancer without prior endocrine treatment.

DPP-4 inhibitors are a class of compounds that work by affecting the action of natural hormones in the body called incretins. Incretins decrease blood sugar by increasing consumption of sugar by the body, mainly through increasing insulin production in the pancreas, and by reducing production of sugar by the liver. [Bristol-Myers Squibb Press Release]

DPP-4 is a membrane associated peptidase which is found in many tissues, lymphocytes and plasma. DPP-4 has two main mechanisms of action, an enzymatic function and another mechanism where DPP-4 binds adenosine deaminase, which conveys intracellular signals via dimerization when activated. Saxagliptin forms a reversible, histidine-assisted covalent bond between its nitrile group and the S630 hydroxyl oxygen on DPP-4. The inhibition of DPP-4 increases levels active of glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which inhibits glucagon production from pancreatic alpha cells and increases production of insulin from pancreatic beta cells.

', 'Post-administration of saxagliptin, GLP-1 and GIP levels rise up to 2- to 3- fold. Because it is very selective of DPP-4 inhibition, there are fewer systemic side effects. Saxagliptin inhibits DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. It also decreased glucagon concentrations and increased glucose-dependent insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells.

It is a very common over-the-counter medication widely used as an analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic.[A39096]



The use of ibuprofen and its enantiomer [DB09213] in a racemic mix is common for the management of mild to moderate pain related to dysmenorrhea, headache, migraine, postoperative dental pain, spondylitis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and soft tissue disorder.[A39097]



Due to its activity against prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis, ibuprofen has been attributed to alteration of platelet function and prolongation of gestation and labour.[A39092]



As ibuprofen is a widely used medication, the main therapeutic indications are:



* Patent Ductus Arteriosus - it is a neonatal condition wherein the ductus arteriosus (blood vessel that connects the main pulmonary artery to the proximal descending aorta) fails to close after birth causing severe risk of heart failure. The prostaglandin inhibition of ibuprofen has been studied for the treatment of this condition as it is known that prostaglandin E2 is responsible for keeping the ductus arteriosus open.[A39100]



* Rheumatoid- and osteo-arthritis - ibuprofen is very commonly used in the symptomatic treatment of inflammatory, musculoskeletal and rheumatic disorders.[A39176]



* Cystic fibrosis - the use of high dosages of ibuprofen has been proven to decrease inflammation and decreasing polymorphonuclear cell influx in the lungs.[A39177]



* Orthostatic hypotension - ibuprofen can induce sodium retention and antagonize the effect of diuretics which has been reported to be beneficial for patients with severe orthostatic hypotension.[A1651]



* Dental pain - ibuprofen is used to manage acute and chronic orofacial pain.[A10901]



* Pain - ibuprofen is widely used to reduce minor aches and pains as well as to reduce fever and manage dysmenorrhea. It is very commonly used for the relief of acute indications such as fever and tension headaches.[A39092] It is also used to manage mild to moderate pain and moderate to severe pain as an adjunct to opioid analgesics.[L40208]



* Investigational uses - efforts have been put into developing ibuprofen for the prophylaxis of Alzheimer''s disease, Parkinson disease, and breast cancer.[A39092]', 'The exact mechanism of action of ibuprofen is unknown. However, ibuprofen is considered an NSAID and thus it is a non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, which is an enzyme involved in prostaglandin (mediators of pain and fever) and thromboxane (stimulators of blood clotting) synthesis via the arachidonic acid pathway.[L4614]



Ibuprofen is a non-selective COX inhibitor and hence, it inhibits the activity of both COX-1 and COX-2. The inhibition of COX-2 activity decreases the synthesis of prostaglandins involved in mediating inflammation, pain, fever, and swelling while the inhibition of COX-1 is thought to cause some of the side effects of ibuprofen including GI ulceration.[A39195]', 'Ibuprofen has multiple actions in different inflammatory pathways involved in acute and chronic inflammation. The main effects reported in ibuprofen are related to the control of pain, fever and acute inflammation by the inhibition of the synthesis of prostanoids by COX-1 and COX-2. Pain relief is attributed to peripheral affected regions and central nervous system effects in the pain transmission mediated by the dorsal horn and higher spinothalamic tract. Some reports have tried to link the pain regulation with a possible enhancement on the synthesis of endogenous cannabinoids and action on the NMDA receptors. The effect on pain has been shown to be related to the cortically evoked potentials.[A39190]



The antipyretic effect is reported to be linked to the effect on the prostanoid synthesis due to the fact that the prostanoids are the main signaling mediator of pyresis in the hypothalamic-preoptic region.[A39190]



The use of ibuprofen in dental procedures is attributed to the local inhibition of prostanoid production as well as to anti-oedemic activity and an increase of plasma beta-endorphins. Some reports have suggested a rapid local reduction of the expression of COX-2 in dental pulp derived by the administration of ibuprofen.[A39190]



The administration of ibuprofen in patients with rheumatic diseases has shown to control joint symptoms.[A39092] 



Ibuprofen is largely used in OTC products such as an agent for the management of dysmenorrhea which has been proven to reduce the amount of menstrual prostanoids and to produce a reduction in the uterine hypercontractility.[A39181] As well, it has been reported to reduce significantly the fever and the pain caused by migraines.[A39182, A39183] This effect is thought to be related to the effect on platelet activation and thromboxane A2 production which produces local vascular effects in the affected regions. This effect is viable as ibuprofen can enter in the central nervous system.[A39190]



In the investigational uses of ibuprofen, it has been reported to reduce neurodegeneration when given in low doses over a long time.[A39184] On the other hand, its use in Parkinson disease is related to the importance of inflammation and oxidative stress in the pathology of this condition.[A39185] The use of ibuprofen for breast cancer is related to a study that shows a decrease of 50% in the rate of breast cancer.[A39186]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Emerging evidence suggests that many cells and tissues are selectively vulnerable to reduced SMN concentrations, making this protein a desirable target in the treatment of SMA.[A192750]



Risdiplam is an mRNA splicing modifier for _SMN2_ that increases the inclusion of exon 7 during splicing, which ultimately increases the amount of functional SMN protein produced by _SMN2_.[A192759] It does so by binding to two sites in _SMN2_ pre-mRNA: the 5'' splice site (5''ss) of intron 7 and the exonic splicing enhancer 2 (ESE2) of exon 7.[A216871]', 'Risdiplam helps to alleviate symptoms of spinal muscular atrophy by stimulating the production of a critical protein in which these patients are deficient.

(2) treatment of pulmonary hypertension, where:

a) the US FDA specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO Group I) in adults to improve exercise ability and delay clinical worsening [F3850]. The delay in clinical worsening was demonstrated when sildenafil was added to background epoprostenol therapy [F3850]. Studies establishing effectiveness were short-term (12 to 16 weeks), and included predominately patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class II-III symptoms and idiopathic etiology (71%) or associated with connective tissue disease (CTD) (25%) [F3850];



b) the Canadian product monograph specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of primary pulmonary arterial hypertension (PPH) or pulmonary hypertension secondary to connective tissue disease (CTD) in adult patients with WHO functional class II or III who have not responded to conventional therapy [F3859]. In addition, improvement in exercise ability and delay in clinical worsening was demonstrated in adult patients who were already stabilized on background epoprostenol therapy [F3859]; and



c) the EMA product information specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension classified as WHO functional class II and III, to improve exercise capacity [F3883]. Efficacy has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with connective tissue disease [F3883]. The EMA label also indicates sildenafil for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years old with pulmonary arterial hypertension [F3883]. Efficacy in terms of improvement of exercise capacity or pulmonary hemodynamics has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital heart disease [F3883].', 'Sildenafil is an oral therapy for erectile dysfunction [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. In the natural setting, i.e. with sexual stimulation, it restores impaired erectile function by increasing blood flow to the penis [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].



The physiological mechanism responsible for the erection of the penis involves the release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Nitric oxide then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].



Sildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in the corpus cavernosum, where PDE5 is responsible for degradation of cGMP [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Sildenafil has a peripheral site of action on erections [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum but potently enhances the relaxant effect of NO on this tissue [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. When the NO/cGMP pathway is activated, as occurs with sexual stimulation, inhibition of PDE5 by sildenafil results in increased corpus cavernosum levels of cGMP [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Therefore sexual stimulation is required in order for sildenafil to produce its intended beneficial pharmacological effects [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].



Moreover, apart from the presence of PDE5 in the corpus cavernosum of the penis, PDE5 is also present in the pulmonary vasculature [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614]. Sildenafil, therefore, increases cGMP within pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells resulting in relaxation [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614]. In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, this can lead to vasodilation of the pulmonary vascular bed and, to a lesser degree, vasodilatation in the systemic circulation [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614].', 'In vitro studies have shown that sildenafil is selective for phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Its effect is more potent on PDE5 than on other known phosphodiesterases [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. In particular, there is a 10-times selectivity over PDE6 which is involved in the phototransduction pathway in the retina [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. There is an 80-times selectivity over PDE1, and over 700-times over PDE 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. And finally, sildenafil has greater than 4,000-times selectivity for PDE5 over PDE3, the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase isoform involved in the control of cardiac contractility [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



In eight double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies of patients with either organic or psychogenic erectile dysfunction, sexual stimulation resulted in improved erections, as assessed by an objective measurement of hardness and duration of erections (via the use of RigiScan®), after sildenafil administration compared with placebo [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Most studies assessed the efficacy of sildenafil approximately 60 minutes post-dose [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The erectile response, as assessed by RigiScan®, generally increased with increasing sildenafil dose and plasma concentration [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The time course of effect was examined in one study, showing an effect for up to 4 hours but the response was diminished compared to 2 hours [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



Sildenafil causes mild and transient decreases in systemic blood pressure which, in the majority of cases, do not translate into clinical effects [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg, three times a day to patients with systemic hypertension the mean change from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was a decrease of 9.4 mmHg and 9.1 mmHg respectively [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg, three times a day to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension lesser effects in blood pressure reduction were observed (a reduction in both systolic and diastolic pressure of 2 mmHg)[F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614] . At the recommended dose of 20 mg three times a day no reductions in systolic or diastolic pressure were seen [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



Single oral doses of sildenafil up to 100 mg in healthy volunteers produced no clinically relevant effects on ECG [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg three times a day to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension no clinically relevant effects on the ECG were reported either [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



In a study of the hemodynamic effects of a single oral 100 mg dose of sildenafil in 14 patients with severe coronary artery disease (CAD) (> 70 % stenosis of at least one coronary artery), the mean resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased by 7 % and 6 % respectively compared to baseline [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Mean pulmonary systolic blood pressure decreased by 9% [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Sildenafil showed no effect on cardiac output and did not impair blood flow through the stenosed coronary arteries [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



Mild and transient differences in color discrimination (blue/green) were detected in some subjects using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test at 1 hour following a 100 mg dose, with no effects evident after 2 hours post-dose [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The postulated mechanism for this change in color discrimination is related to inhibition of PDE6, which is involved in the phototransduction cascade of the retina [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Sildenafil has no effect on visual acuity or contrast sensitivity. In a small size placebo-controlled study of patients with documented early age-related macular degeneration (n = 9), sildenafil (single dose, 100 mg) demonstrated no significant changes in visual tests conducted (which included visual acuity, Amsler grid, color discrimination simulated traffic light, and the Humphrey perimeter and photostress test) [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Different DNA repair pathways exist to repair these DNA damages, including the base excision repair (BER) pathway for SSBs and BRCA-dependent homologous recombination for DSBs.[A245985]



Olaparib is a PARP inhibitor: while it acts on PARP1, PARP2, and PARP3, olaparib is a more selective competitive inhibitor of NAD<sup>+</sup> at the catalytic site of PARP1 and PARP2. Inhibition of the BER pathway by olaparib leads to the accumulation of unrepaired SSBs, which leads to the formation of DSBs, which is the most toxic form of DNA damage. While BRCA-dependent homologous recombination can repair DSBs in normal cells, this repair pathway is defective in cells with BRCA1/2 mutations, such as certain tumour cells.[A246015] Inhibition of PARP in cancer cells with BRCA mutations leads to genomic instability and apoptotic cell death. This end result is also referred to as synthetic lethality, a phenomenon where the combination of two defects - inhibition of PARP activity and loss of DSB repair by HR - that are otherwise benign when alone, lead to detrimental results.[A245985]



_In vitro_ studies have shown that olaparib-induced cytotoxicity may involve inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity and increased formation of PARP-DNA complexes, resulting in DNA damage and cancer cell death.[L41100] ', 'Olaparib is a cytotoxic and anti-tumour agent. Olaparib inhibits the growth of selective tumour cell lines _in vitro_ and decreases tumour growth in mouse xenograft models of human cancer, both as monotherapy or following platinum-based chemotherapy. The drug exerts anti-tumour effects in cell lines and mouse tumour models with deficiencies in BRCA1/2, ATM, or other genes involved in the homologous recombination repair (HRR) of DNA damage and correlated with platinum response.[L41100]



In preclinical models of cancer, olaparib demonstrated anti-tumour activity when used alone, in combination with chemotherapeutic agents, or radiotherapy.[A246020] Olaparib can act as a chemosensitizer to potentiate the cytotoxicity of DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents such as alkylating agents and platinum-based drugs. It can also act as a radiosensitizer by preventing PARP-mediated DNA repair.[A245985, A246015]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

In addition to the above, canagliflozin can be used to lower the risk of end-stage kidney disease and major increases in serum creatinine and cardiovascular death for patients with a combination of type 2 diabetes mellitus, diabetic nephropathy, and albuminuria.[L8917]

The renal threshold is defined as the lowest level of blood glucose associated with the appearance of detectable glucose in the urine [A176969, T545].  The end result of canagliflozin administration is increased urinary excretion of glucose and less renal absorption of glucose, decreasing glucose concentration in the blood and improving glycemic control. 



**A note on type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease**



The risk of cardiovascular events in diabetes type 2 is increased due to the damaging effects of diabetes on blood vessels and nerves in the cardiovascular system.  In particular, there is a tendency for hyperglycemia to create pro-atherogenic (plaque forming) lesions in blood vessels, leading to various fatal and non-fatal events including stroke and myocardial infarction [A177086, L5933].  Long-term glycemic control has been proven to be effective in the prevention of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes [A177095].

Potassium ions participate in a number of essential physiological processes including the maintenance of intracellular tonicity, the transmission of nerve impulses, the contraction of cardiac, skeletal and smooth muscle, and the maintenance of normal renal function. The intracellular concentration of potassium is approximately 150 to 160 mEq per liter. The normal adult plasma concentration is 3.5 to 5 mEq per liter. An active ion transport system maintains this gradient across the plasma membrane. Potassium is a normal dietary constituent and under steady-state conditions the amount of potassium absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract is equal to the amount excreted in the urine. The usual dietary intake of potassium is 50 to 100 mEq per day. Potassium depletion will occur whenever the rate of potassium loss through renal excretion and/or loss from the gastrointestinal tract exceeds the rate of potassium intake. Such depletion usually develops as a consequence of therapy with diuretics, primarily or secondary hyperaldosteronism, diabetic ketoacidosis, or inadequate replacement of potassium in patients on prolonged parenteral nutrition. Depletion can develop rapidly with severe diarrhea, especially if associated with vomiting. Potassium depletion due to these causes is usually accompanied by concomitant loss of chloride and is manifested by hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Potassium depletion may produce weakness, fatigue, disturbances of cardiac rhythm (primarily ectopic beats), prominent U-waves in the electrocardiogram, and, in advanced cases, flaccid paralysis and/or impaired ability to concentrate urine.

Erythromycin is indicated in the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of various bacteria.[L7261] The indications for erythromycin have been summarized by body system below:



**Respiratory infections**



Mild to moderate upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenzae (when used concomitantly with appropriate doses of sulfonamides) can be treated with erythromycin.[L7261] Mild to moderate lower-respiratory tract infections due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Streptococcus pyogenes may also be treated. Erythromycin treats listeriosis caused by Listeria monocytogenes may also be treated with erythromycin.[L7261]

Erythromycin is indicated to treat pertussis (whooping cough) caused by Bordetella pertussis. It is effective in eliminating the causative organism from the nasopharynx of infected individuals, rendering them noninfectious. Clinical studies suggest that erythromycin may aid in the prevention of pertussis infection for individuals who have been exposed to the bacteria.[L7261] Respiratory tract infections due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae may also be treated with erythromycin.[L7261]  Despite the fact that no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted to this date, in vitro and certain preliminary clinical study results indicate that erythromycin may be an effective treatment in  Legionnaires’ Disease.[L7261] Finally, erythromycin is indicated to treat diphtheria and other infections due to Corynebacterium diphtheriae, as an adjunct to antitoxin, to prevent carrier status and to eradicate the organism in existing carriers.[L7261] In addition to the prevention of diphtheria, erythromycin can be used to prevent rheumatic fever in penicillin intolerant patients.[L7261]

 



**Skin infections**



Mild to moderate skin or skin structure infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus may be treated with erythromycin, however, resistant staphylococcal organisms may emerge.[L7261] Erythromycin can also be used to treat erythrasma, an infectious condition caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum.[L7261]





**Gastrointestinal infections**



Intestinal amebiasis caused by Entamoeba histolytica can be treated with oral erythromycin. Extraenteric amebiasis warrants treatment with other antimicrobial drugs.[L7261]





**Genital infections/STIs**



Erythromycin can be used as an alternative drug in treating acute pelvic inflammatory disease caused by N. gonorrheae in female patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity or intolerance to penicillin.[L7261] Syphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum, can be treated with erythromycin.  It serves as an alternative treatment for primary syphilis in patients who have demonstrated penicillin hypersensitivity. Erythromycin can also be used in the primary stage of primary syphilis.[L7261] Another approved indication of erythromycin is to treat chlamydial infections that cause conjunctivitis of the newborn, pneumonia of infancy, and urogenital infections occurring in pregnancy. It is indicated as an alternative option to tetracyclines for the treatment of uncomplicated rectal, urethral and endocervical infections in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.[L7261] Erythromycin can be used in nongonococcal urethritis can be used when tetracyclines cannot be administered. Finally, erythromycin is indicated to treat nongonococcal urethritis due to Ureaplasma urealyticum.[L7261]

', 'In order to replicate, bacteria require a specific process of protein synthesis, enabled by ribosomal proteins.[A6505] Erythromycin acts by inhibition of protein synthesis by binding to the 23S ribosomal RNA molecule in the 50S subunit of ribosomes in susceptible bacterial organisms.  It stops bacterial protein synthesis by inhibiting the transpeptidation/translocation step of protein synthesis and by inhibiting the assembly of the 50S ribosomal subunit.[L7261,A14179] This results in the control of various bacterial infections.[A174193,L7261] The strong affinity of macrolides, including erythromycin, for bacterial ribosomes, supports their broad‐spectrum antibacterial activities.[A174193]



', 'Macrolides, such as erythromycin, stop bacterial growth by inhibiting protein synthesis and translation, treating bacterial infections.[A174175] Erythromycin does not exert effects on nucleic acid synthesis.[L7261] This drug has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, effectively treating both in vitro and clinical infections. Despite this, it is important to perform bacterial susceptibility testing before administering this antibiotic, as resistance is a common issue that may affect treatment.[L7261] 



**A note on antimicrobial resistance, pseudomembranous colitis, and hepatotoxicity**



Many strains of Haemophilus influenzae are resistant to erythromycin alone but are found to be susceptible to erythromycin and sulfonamides used in combination. It is important to note that Staphylococci that are resistant to erythromycin may emerge during erythromycin and/or sulfonamide therapy.[L7261] Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with most antibacterial agents, including erythromycin, and may range in severity from mild to life-threatening. Therefore, the physician should consider this diagnosis in patients with diarrhea after the administration of antibacterial agents.[L7261] Erythromycin can cause hepatic dysfunction, cholestatic jaundice, and abnormal liver transaminases, particularly when erythromycin estolate is administered.[L7270]

Verapamil is commonly used off-label for prophylaxis of cluster headaches.[A13983]', 'Verapamil inhibits L-type calcium channels by binding to a specific area of their alpha-1 subunit,[L10478]Cav1.2, which is highly expressed on L-type calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle and myocardial tissue where these channels are responsible for the control of peripheral vascular resistance and heart contractility.[A175396] Calcium influx through these channels allows for the propagation of action potentials necessary for the contraction of muscle tissue and the heart''s electrical pacemaker activity. Verapamil binds to these channels in a voltage- and frequency-dependent manner, meaning affinity is increased 1) as vascular smooth muscle membrane potential is reduced, and 2) with excessive depolarizing stimulus.[L10478] 



Verapamil''s mechanism of action in the treatment of angina and hypertension is likely due to the mechanism described above. Inhibition of calcium influx prevents the contraction of vascular smooth muscle, causing relaxation/dilation of blood vessels throughout the peripheral circulation - this lowers systemic vascular resistance (i.e. afterload) and thus blood pressure. This reduction in vascular resistance also reduces the force against which the heart must push, decreasing myocardial energy consumption and oxygen requirements and thus alleviating angina.[L8791]



Electrical activity through the AV node is responsible for determining heart rate, and this activity is dependent upon calcium influx through L-type calcium channels. By inhibiting these channels and decreasing the influx of calcium, verapamil prolongs the refractory period of the AV node and slows conduction, thereby slowing and controlling the heart rate in patients with arrhythmia.[L8791]



Verapamil''s mechanism of action in the treatment of cluster headaches is unclear, but is thought to result from an effect on other calcium channels (e.g. N-, P-, Q-, or T-type).[A13983]



Verapamil is known to interact with other targets, including other calcium channels,[A188490,A13984,A188502,A15331] potassium channels,[A188496,A13985,A13983] and adrenergic receptors.[A20291,A31755]', 'Verapamil is an L-type calcium channel blocker with antiarrhythmic, antianginal, and antihypertensive activity.[L8791] Immediate-release verapamil has a relatively short duration of action, requiring dosing 3 to 4 times daily,[L8791] but extended-release formulations are available that allow for once-daily dosing.[L10478,L10637] As verapamil is a negative inotropic medication (i.e. it decreases the strength of myocardial contraction), it should not be used in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as the decrease in contractility caused by verapamil may increase the risk of exacerbating these pre-existing conditions.[L10478]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Loratadine binds to H1 histamine receptors found on the surface of epithelial cells, endothelial cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, airway cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells among others.[A176441] H1 histamine receptors fall under the wider umbrella of G-protein coupled receptors, and exist in a state of equilibrium between the active and inactive forms.[A176441][A175060] Histamine binding to the H1-receptor facilitates cross linking between transmembrane domains III and V, stabilizing the active form of the receptor.[A176441][A175060] On the other hand, antihistamines bind to a different site on the H1 receptor favouring the inactive form.[A176441][A175060]
