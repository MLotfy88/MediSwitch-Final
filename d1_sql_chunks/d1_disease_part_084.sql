Patients with preexisting heart disease or prior anthracycline therapy are at increased risk of congestive heart failure.  The benefit-to-risk ratio of daunorubicin therapy in such patients should be weighed before starting treatment.  The incidence of drug-induced congestive heart failure in adults is increased when the total cumulative dose of daunorubicin exceeds 550/mg/m2.
