Cardioselective beta-blockers can occasionally precipitate acute bronchospasm in these patients, despite relative selectivity for beta-1 receptors in cardiac tissues. Presumably, beta-1 selectivity is dose-dependent and may be lost given a sufficient dose of the beta-blocker in susceptible patients.
