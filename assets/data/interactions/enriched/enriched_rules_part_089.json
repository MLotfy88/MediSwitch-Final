Rare cases of pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia have also occurred with leflunomide alone, but were most frequent in the presence of concomitant or recent use of methotrexate or other myelotoxic agents. Due to the prolonged elimination half-life of leflunomide's active metabolite, an interaction may occur even when hematotoxic agents are initiated after the discontinuation of leflunomide.

Prolonged and severe hypoglycemia may occur, although these events have rarely been reported. Significant increases in blood pressure and bradycardia can also occur during hypoglycemia in diabetics treated with insulin and beta-blockers due to antagonism of epinephrine's effect on beta-2 adrenergic receptors, which leads to unopposed alpha-adrenergic effects including vasoconstriction.

The risk is thought to extend to teriflunomide, its principal active metabolite, because recommended dosages of both result in a similar range of plasma concentrations of teriflunomide. Serious infections including sepsis, as well as opportunistic infections like Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis, and aspergillosis have been reported with the use of leflunomide, particularly in patients on concomitant hematotoxic therapy. Agents that may be significantly immuno- or myelosuppressive include antineoplastic agents, radiation, zidovudine, linezolid, some antirheumatic agents, high dosages of corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic agents , and long-term topical or inhaled corticosteroids. Rare cases of pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia have also occurred with leflunomide alone, but were most frequent in the presence of concomitant or recent use of methotrexate or other myelotoxic agents. Due to the prolonged elimination half-life of leflunomide's active metabolite, an interaction may occur even when hematotoxic agents are initiated after the discontinuation of leflunomide. Administering a washout procedure with cholestyramine or activated charcoal helps to accelerate elimination of the active metabolite from plasma and reduce the overlap of systemic exposure to these agents.",

All patients treated with thalidomide should be examined at monthly intervals for the first three months of therapy and periodically thereafter to detect early signs of neuropathy such as burning, tingling, pain, or numbness in the hands and feet. Electrophysiological testing may be performed at baseline and every six months during therapy to detect asymptomatic neuropathy. Consideration should be given to immediate discontinuation of thalidomide in patients who develop peripheral neuropathy to limit further damage. Symptoms may improve or return to baseline in some patients upon discontinuation of thalidomide, although the complete time course of this toxicity has not been fully characterized. Because bradycardia is a risk factor for torsade de pointes arrhythmia, caution is advised when thalidomide is used with drugs that can prolong the QT interval or induce torsade de pointes arrhythmia. Patients should be monitored for bradycardia, atrioventricular block and syncope, and advised to seek medical attention if they experience dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, shortness of breath, or slow or irregular heartbeat.
