    "indications": "Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a progressive disease that, if left untreated, can be life-threatening and lead to failure of the right ventricle. The 6th world symposium on pulmonary hypertension (WSPH), held in 2019, defined PH as mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) > 20 mmHg.\n[1]\nEuropean society of cardiology and European respiratory society updated guidelines in 2022 and further classified PH as pre-capillary PH with pulmonary vascular resistance > 2 wood units and pulmonary wedge pressures less than or equal to 15 and post-capillary PH with pulmonary wedge pressures greater than 15 mmHg.\n[2]\nFurthermore, the World Health Organization (WHO) divided PH into five groups based on differences in pathophysiology and therapeutic options.\n[3]\nPH associated with respiratory system disorders due to chronic lung disease with or without hypoxemia is included in group 3. This article discusses etiology, epidemiology, clinical and physician manifestation, evaluation, and management.\n\nOther groups of pulmonary hypertension include pulmonary arterial hypertension (group 1), PH due to left heart disease (group 2), PH due to chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) (group 4), and other miscellaneous disorders causing PH (group 5) will be discussed separately.",
    "mechanism": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and diffuse pulmonary lung disease (DPLD), including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE), are the most common disease-causing chronic hypoxia and are associated with the highest incidence of pulmonary hypertension in this group.\n[4]\nPulmonary hypertension in this group varies with the severity of the disease. Most patients with COPD have mild to moderate PH, but a small group of patients with advanced COPD develops severe PH. The development of PH in this group of lung diseases is associated with a poor functional status, impaired quality of life, need for supplemental oxygen, and worse prognosis.\n\nOther conditions that PH may also develop are cystic fibrosis, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, lung cancer, and other less common chronic lung diseases, including pulmonary Langerhans histiocytosis and lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). The severity of PH is reported to be proportional to the extent of illness and parenchymal involvement.\n[5]\nA small percentage of PH is also reported in developmental lung disorders like bronchopulmonary dysplasia and congenital diaphragmatic hernia.\n[6]\n\nOther causes include pulmonary hypertension associated with hypoxia at high altitudes, which develops in people living over 2500 meters above sea level.\n[7]\nPH is reported more frequently in obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) and overlap syndrome than in obstructive sleep apnea.\n[8]\nDue to associated nocturnal desaturation and worsening lung function, these patients with OHS usually present with more severe PH and poor prognosis.\n[9]",
    "monitoring": "Due to the lack of sensitivity and specificity of physical examination, prompt screening and testing are required to establish the diagnosis. Pulmonary function tests (PFT) help to distinguish between restrictive and obstructive impairment. An out-of-proportion decrease in diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) may predict the development of pulmonary hypertension and the need for further investigation. In general, a low DLCO (<40% of predicted) or rapid decline in DLCO (≥ 15%), and a DLCO disproportionate to lung volumes (i.e., FVC/DLCO ratio > 1.6), is a trigger for a low threshold for suspicion for PH.\n[16]\nIt is also associated with high PVR and is a predictor of increased mortality in patients with interstitial lung disease.\n[19]\nTherefore, a screening method was proposed for PH in patients with advanced IPF, which shows that using the ratio of FVC /DLCO when combined with SpO2 in linear regression formula has high sensitivity and negative predictive value to screen patients with mPAP > 21 mmHg.\n[20]\n\nSix-minute walk test (6MWT) and oxygen saturation on exertion also give insight into the underlying presence of PH. A worsening six-minute walk distance (6MWD) despite stable PFT, need for oxygen supplementation on exertion, and slow heart rate recovery in one minute can predict underlying PH.\n[21]\n[22]\nHowever, there is no specific threshold identified to date for 6MWD or desaturation to predict the presence of PH.\n\nWhen there is high clinical suspicion of pulmonary hypertension, the consensus from experts recommends obtaining echocardiography and Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or NT-proBNP. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is considered the most useful non-invasive screening test for PH. Right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) can be estimated using the peak tricuspid regurgitation velocity, and systolic pulmonary artery pressures (sPAP) can be predicted using inferior vena cava (IVC) dilatation and collapsibility as a surrogate marker for right atrial pressures. TTE also helps to distinguish between pre-capillary and post-capillary hypertension by measuring left-sided parameters such as left atrial dilation and elevated diastolic filling pressures. Several studies, however, have shown that estimation of pressure through TTE can significantly overestimate the RVSP in chronic lung disease and lead to overdiagnosis of group 3 PH.\n[23]\n[5]\nA study looked into adding other factors, including right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) diameter and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) with RVSP, showed improved sensitivity and negative predictive value to predict PH in patients with advanced lung disease.\n[24]\n\nSerum biomarkers such as BNP or N terminal-pro-BNP concentrations are useful screening tools for assessing patients with ILD-related-PH. Serum BNP levels are an independent prognostic marker used for risk evaluation. BNP, however, loses sensitivity when PH is cofounded by left heart disease.\n[25]\n[26]\n\nPulmonary hypertension can be multifactorial and present as a spectrum of diseases due to the right and left heart disease. Right heart catheterization (RHC) is the gold standard for confirming the diagnosis of PH due to chronic lung disease and hypoxia. RHC can be valuable in distinguishing between pre- and post-capillary disease or the presence of combined pre-capillary and post-capillary disease. RHC is recommended for patients with exaggerated symptoms not explained by the extent of the underlying condition, patients undergoing evaluation for treatment with vasodilators, and patients being considered for a lung transplant. However, a low threshold for RHC is appropriate to confirm a PH diagnosis, particularly in those with high clinical suspicion of PH and right ventricular abnormalities on echocardiography (including dilation or enlargement and a low tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion) and in those with autoimmune ILD.\n\nIn addition to PFT and 6MWD, other useful testing modalities are chest Computed Tomography (CT) scans which can be very useful to evaluate ILD stability or progression when symptoms are disproportionate to the severity of the underlying ILD.\n\nCT scan of the chest is commonly obtained in patients with COPD and ILD to measure the disease's extent and screen for lung cancer. There is no significant correlation between the extent of parenchymal changes seen on high-resolution CT imaging and the presence and degree of PH.\n[27]\n\nThe ratio of the main pulmonary artery to ascending aorta greater than 0.9 in IPF predicted PH and worse outcomes.\n[28]\n[29]",
    "administration": "The goal of the management of PH in group 3 is to optimize the underlying disease and improve the functional status. This includes guideline-directed therapy using appropriate bronchodilators in obstructive lung disease, antifibrotics in patients with fibrotic lung disease, and immunosuppressive agents in connective tissue disease-induced ILD to slow disease progression.\n\nPatients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) should be encouraged to use noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV).\n[30]\nLong-term use of NIV in OHS has been shown to improve pulmonary hemodynamics.\n[31]\n\nIn patients with advanced disease with hypoxemia, long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) in patients with COPD has shown a decrease in the progression of PH when used for >15 hours and improvement in PAP when used for >18 hours.\n[32]\n[33]\nHowever, there is no direct evidence to support that the use of LTOT in pulmonary fibrosis slows PH progression. Still, supplementary oxygen should be prescribed to avoid prolonged episodes of hypoxia which can potentially further worsen pulmonary hypertension.\n\nSystemic vasodilators have been associated with concerns regarding the theoretical risk of worsening gas exchange due to hypoxic vasoconstriction and subsequent ventilation-perfusion mismatch.\n[34]\nAlthough this has not been observed in the multiple trials conducted to investigate the potential use of vasodilators in patients with ILD.\n[4]\nTrials with endothelin receptor antagonists, including Bosentan, Macitentan, and Ambrisentan, have shown no benefit but may be harmful.\n[35]\n[36]\n[37]\nA trial with Riociguat, a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, was stopped early due to increased adverse events and mortality.\n[38]\nPhosphodiesterase-type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i) have been studied in multiple trials in patients with chronic lung disease with no significant improvement in 6MWD or quality of life.\n[39]\n[40]\n\nThe most recent use of inhaled treprostinil in the INCREASE trial showed an improved six-minute walk distance compared to patients who received a placebo. This supports the idea that inhaled vasodilators may cause less ventilation-perfusion mismatch than systemic use of vasodilators.\n[41]\n\nWhile most vasodilator therapies are not effective and may be harmful, inhaled treprostinil is approved in group 3 PH. Based on the INCREASE trial, the US FDA approved inhaled treprostinil as the first and only treatment for group 3 PH associated with ILD. When supportive therapy and inhaled vasodilator therapy fail to control the disease progression, systemic vasodilators can be cautiously trialed on a case-by-case basis in tertiary pulmonary hypertension centers.\n\nPatients with advanced lung disease should be referred to centers with expertise in advanced lung disease and pulmonary hypertension for early evaluation of the lung transplant.\n[4]\nThe international society for heart and lung transplant Guidelines recommends that patients with IPF should be referred to the transplant center when FVC < 80% and DLCO < 40% predicted or progressive decline in FVC and DLCO of 10% and 15% of predicted, respectively. Similarly, patients with COPD should be referred with FEV1< 25% of predicted and a BODE score >5.\n[42]",
    "adverse_effects": "Elevated pressures in the pulmonary artery secondary to hypoxia from untreated and progressively worsening chronic lung disease increase right ventricular afterload. Due to the slow progression of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR)in the setting of group 3 PH, RV adapts and hypertrophy to compensate for the high afterload. This subsequently causes RV diastolic dysfunction and paves the way to right ventricular and pulmonary artery (RV-PA) uncoupling. In one study, RV dysfunction was seen as worse in group 3 PH compared to patients in group 1 PH despite less severe PVR. Worse outcomes were also observed in the male gender. [46] In addition, lung hyperinflation and an increase in intrapleural pressures decrease the preload and venous return to RV. Under the persistently high afterload, RV eventually fails with reduced systolic function, and cor pulmonale ensues.\n[47]"
