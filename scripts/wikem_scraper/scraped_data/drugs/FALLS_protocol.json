      "text": "The FALLS-protocol is an ultrasound evaluation of patients with acute circulatory failure\nIncludes evaluation of the pleura, lungs, and pericardium using ultrasound in a step-wise fashion to categorize circulatory shock is present according to Weil's shock classification",

    "Endpoints": {
      "text": "Prior to FALLS Protocol (BLUE-Protocol)\nObstructive shock - Tamponade or pneumothorax on initial ultrasound\nCardiogenic shock - B-profile on itial ultrasound\nWith FALLS Protocol\nHypovolemic shock - Improvement after IVF\nSeptic shock - B-profile and continued failure after IVF",
