Patients should be instructed to immediately report any signs or symptoms suggesting bone marrow suppression such as fever, sore throat, or local infection.  Therapy should be administered cautiously to patients with compromised bone marrow reserve and should be withheld until neutrophil levels is > 1500/mm3 and/or platelet counts is > 100,000/mm3.  A 25% reduction in dosage is recommended during subsequent cycles following severe neutropenia (< 500/mm3).
