Sympathetic stimulation may be important in maintaining the hemodynamic function in these patients, thus beta-blockade can worsen the heart failure.  However, therapy with beta-blockers may be beneficial and can be administered cautiously in some CHF patients provided they are well compensated and receiving digitalis, diuretics, an ACE inhibitor, and/or nitrates.  Carvedilol, specifically, is indicated for use with these agents in the treatment of mild to severe heart failure of ischemic or cardiomyopathic origin.  There is also increasing evidence that the addition of a beta-blocker to standard therapy can improve morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced heart failure, although it is uncertain whether effectiveness varies significantly with the different agents.
