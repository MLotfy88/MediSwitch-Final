    "clinical_significance": "Classifying cutaneous neoplasms is essential for guiding diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment strategies. Cutaneous neoplasms are broadly categorized into epidermal, melanocytic, adnexal, hematolymphoid, mesenchymal, and metastatic tumors.\n\nEpidermal Neoplasms\n\nEpidermal tumors encompass a broad spectrum of benign, premalignant, and malignant lesions arising from keratinocytes, making them among the most frequently encountered in dermatopathology. Although much less common, MCC is classified as an epidermal tumor in the WHO Classification of Tumors, 5th edition, due to its origin from skin-derived neuroendocrine cells.\n\nBenign epidermal tumors\n\nBenign epidermal tumors include verrucae, acanthomas, and seborrheic keratoses. Verrucae (warts) are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) and histologically exhibit hyperkeratosis, papillomatosis, and acanthosis (see\nImage\n. Wart). Clear cell acanthomas are well-circumscribed lesions with psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia, elongated and fused rete ridges, and thinning of the papillary plates while sparing adnexal structures (see\nImage\n. Clear Cell Acanthoma). These lesions consist of periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain-positive keratinocytes with pale-to-clear cytoplasm. Large cell acanthoma, a variant, features enlarged keratinocytes with nuclei twice the size of adjacent normal keratinocytes. These sharply demarcated lesions display mild acanthosis, epidermal flattening, and overlying basket-weave hyperkeratosis.\n\nSeborrheic keratoses are among the most common benign epidermal tumors, characterized by intraepidermal proliferation of monomorphic basaloid cells with horn cysts and pseudohorn cysts. These well-circumscribed lesions have papillomatous outlines and a flat base (see\nImage\n. Seborrheic Keratosis). Differentiating an irritated or inflamed seborrheic keratosis from Bowen disease or well-differentiated SCC can be challenging, particularly in shave biopsy specimens.\n\nPremalignant epidermal tumors\n\nPremalignant lesions include actinic keratoses, arsenical keratoses, and psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) keratoses. All of these conditions have the potential to progress to SCC.\n\nActinic keratoses, often regarded as SCC\nin situ\n, is characterized by dysplasia of the basal epidermal layer, loss of maturation, dyskeratosis, isolated mitotic figures, absence of granular cell layers, and alternating orthokeratosis and hyperkeratosis or parakeratosis. Actinic elastosis is typically present in the superficial dermis (see\nImage\n. Actinic Keratosis). Unlike full-thickness squamous dysplasia, actinic keratosis involves only the lower portion of the epidermis.\n\nArsenical keratoses appear as multiple hyperkeratotic lesions on the hands and feet following chronic arsenic exposure. Affected individuals may also exhibit diffuse or localized hyperpigmentation, raindrop-like pigmentation on the trunk, and yellowish hyperkeratotic papules or verrucous plaques on palmoplantar skin. Histopathologically, these lesions range from acanthosis and hyperkeratosis to squamous dysplasia, often featuring vacuolated dysplastic keratinocytes and atypical mitoses.\n[14]\n\nPUVA keratoses develop on sun-protected skin after prolonged PUVA therapy. Clinically, the lesions present as multiple warty, hyperkeratotic, and scaly papules with a broad base, while histologically, they are characterized by sharply demarcated acanthosis with overlying hyperkeratosis.\n[15]\n\nMalignant epidermal tumors\n\nKeratinocytic malignancies, including BCC and SCC, are the most frequently encountered cancers in clinical and pathological practice. The incidence of these conditions surpasses that of all other cancers combined.\n\nBCC is the most common malignancy, accounting for about 80% of all skin cancers.\n[16]\nThis tumor arises from keratinocytes, particularly in fair-skinned populations, and typically grows slowly over months to years, with rare metastatic potential.\n[17]\n\nHistopathologically, BCC is diverse, encompassing over 20 recognized patterns, including nodular, superficial, micronodular, infiltrating, and sclerosing or morphoeic types.\n[18]\nDespite this variation, all BCC types share key features, including basaloid tumor cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and scant cytoplasm. Apoptotic cells are frequently observed within the nests, while stromal changes often include fibromyxoid alteration, tumor nest retraction from the stroma, calcification, and amyloid deposition. Tumor nests may also be colonized by melanocytes and contain melanin pigment. Additionally, solar elastosis is typically present in the underlying dermis (see\nImage\n. Basal Cell Carcinoma).\n\nSCC is more prevalent than BCC in immunosuppressed populations and carries a significant metastatic potential.\n[19]\nThis neoplasm is the 2nd most common malignancy worldwide, primarily affecting the skin and mucosa of the head and neck.\n[20]\nClassic SCC\nin situ\n, known as Bowen disease, presents as erythematous, scaling plaques with full-thickness keratinocyte atypia, loss of maturation, mitoses at all levels, and dyskeratotic cells. Approximately 4% of SCC\nin situ\nlesions progress to invasive SCC.\n[21]\n\nInvasive SCCs range from well to poorly differentiated. Well-differentiated forms, such as keratoacanthomas, feature polygonal cells, pleomorphism, and significant keratin production (see\nImage\n. Squamous Cell Carcinoma). Histological subtypes include acantholytic SCC, characterized by dyscohesive cells and pseudolumina; clear cell SCC, distinguished by abundant clear cytoplasm and PAS-positive glycogen; and spindle cell SCC, also known as sarcomatoid SCC, which exhibits spindled tumor cells with focal or absent keratinization. While clear cell SCC may show focal androgen receptor positivity, sebaceous carcinoma—typically diffusely positive for androgen receptors and adipophilin—can be excluded.\n[22]\n\nSarcomatoid SCC is a rare and aggressive variant with a poor prognosis. This tumor may be distinguished from other spindle cell malignancies by uniform positivity for p63 or CK5/6.\n[23]\n[24]\nConditions such as Paget disease and MIS can mimic SCC\nin situ\n. Strong CK7 or carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) positivity in Paget disease and SOX10 expression in melanoma serve as diagnostic markers.\n\nMCC is a rare but aggressive skin cancer, primarily affecting elderly individuals with sun-damaged skin. This pathology typically presents as a rapidly growing, flesh-colored or violaceous nodule, most often on the head or neck. MCC originates from Merkel cells in the basal layer of the epidermis, which function as part of the skin’s neuroendocrine system.\n\nHistopathologically, MCC appears as a “blue” nodule with either circumscribed or infiltrative growth patterns in the dermis or subcutis. The tumor cells are densely packed in large or small aggregates, with nuclei exhibiting a finely stippled chromatin pattern. Mitotic figures and apoptotic bodies are common, and lymphatic invasion is frequently observed. MCC can be positive or negative for Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV), with virus-negative cases often associated with or potentially originating from SCC.\n[25]\n\nOn IHC studies, MCC tumor cells express both epithelial and neuroendocrine markers. Perinuclear dot-like staining for CK20 or neurofilament is a reliable diagnostic feature, while TTF-1 staining is almost always negative (see\nImage\n. Merkel Cell Carcinoma).\n\nMelanocytic Neoplasms\n\nMelanocytic tumors are classified into nevi, melanocytomas, and melanomas. Nevi are benign lesions characterized by a single mutation without additional pathogenic alterations. Some lesions previously categorized as nevi are now referred to as \"melanocytomas,\" indicating neoplasms with multiple mutations that suggest progression toward malignancy. These lesions often exhibit atypical histological features or clinical behavior, with mutations typically occurring in specific pathways, such as WNT and BAP1.\n\nPrimary cutaneous melanomas have traditionally been classified based on histopathological and clinical features. However, advances in genetic research have identified biologically distinct melanoma subtypes with unique characteristics. Integrating genetic data with clinical and histopathological findings has refined melanoma classification, revealing variations in genetic profiles, clinical presentation, age of onset, anatomic site, and cell of origin.\n\nBenign melanocytic neoplasms\n\nBenign melanocytic lesions include junctional, compound, and dermal nevi, which are localized clonal proliferations of nevoid melanocytes. These nevi are classified based on their location within the skin. Simple lentigo and lentiginous melanocytic nevi are distinct entities. Simple lentigo (lentigo simplex) is characterized by hyperpigmented keratinocytes with a variable number of intraepidermal melanocytes dispersed along the epidermal basal layer without forming nests. In contrast, a lentiginous melanocytic nevus exhibits a lentiginous proliferation of melanocytes along with nests of 3 or more melanocytes within the basal epidermis. Lentiginous compound nevi contain both intraepidermal lentiginous melanocytes and nests, as well as dermal melanocytic components within the papillary dermis.\n\nA dysplastic nevus is a benign melanocytic lesion that appears clinically atypical and exhibits histological features of architectural disorder and cytologic atypia. A halo nevus is defined by circumferential depigmentation, often accompanied by a brisk lymphocytic infiltrate histologically. A combined nevus is a histopathologically benign melanocytic neoplasm composed of 2 or more phenotypically distinct tumor cell populations. However, this classification excludes molecularly defined representations of stepwise tumor progression, such as WNT-activated deep penetrating/plexiform melanocytoma (nevus), combined BAP1-inactivated melanocytoma, and pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma (PEM), as well as collision tumors.\n\nMelanocytomas\n\nWNT-activated deep penetrating/plexiform melanocytomas are rare melanocytic lesions that can be challenging to distinguish from malignant melanoma due to their atypical histological features. These lesions typically present as solitary, symmetrical, pigmented papules or nodules and are more common in young individuals. Histologically, the tumors appear as well-demarcated, wedge-shaped lesions composed of loosely arranged nests of slightly enlarged epithelioid to spindle-shaped pigmented melanocytes, interspersed with melanophages, extending into the reticular dermis and subcutis.\n[26]\n\nKey distinguishing features of WNT-activated deep penetrating/plexiform melanocytomas include infrequent mitotic activity and minimal pagetoid spread. Additionally, these lesions frequently harbor\nCTNNB1\ngene mutations, resulting in continuous activation of the β-catenin signaling pathway. This molecular characteristic aids in differentiating them from other nevi and melanomas, which typically lack these mutations.\n[27]\n\nPEM is a rare melanocytic neoplasm composed of heavily pigmented epithelioid and spindle cells. Although occasional mitotic figures and necrosis may be present, these features are generally less pronounced than in more aggressive melanomas. Histologically, PEMs often display a biphasic pattern, with tumor cells predominantly confined to the dermis and frequently extending into the subcutis. Approximately 2/3 of PEMs exhibit\nPRKAR1A\ngene loss. IHC staining shows expression of routine melanocytic markers, while loss of\nPRKAR1A\nexpression can confirm\nPRKAR1A\ninactivation in up to 80% of cases.\n[28]\n\nBAP1-inactivated melanocytomas are characterized by epithelioid cell morphology and genetic inactivation of the\nBAP1\ngene. Clinically, the lesions present as flesh-colored papules or nodules and are primarily intradermal melanocytic proliferations, sometimes with junctional involvement.\n\nThe hallmark cells of BAP1-inactivated melanocytomas are large epithelioid melanocytes with well-defined cytoplasmic borders, abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, and vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli. These melanocytes, typically unpigmented, reside within the dermis and exhibit varying degrees of nuclear and nucleolar size variation, including nuclear pleomorphism with dispersed chromatin patterns.\n[29]\nMitotic activity is low, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are often observed. Loss of nuclear BAP1 expression, as detected by IHC, is diagnostically equivalent to biallelic\nBAP1\ninactivation on molecular testing and can confirm the diagnosis.\n\nMalignant melanocytic neoplasms\n\n\"Cumulative sun damage\" (CSD) refers to the long-term effects of UV radiation exposure and serves as a basis for classifying UV-related melanomas. Lesions include low-CSD, high-CSD, and desmoplastic melanoma, whereas melanomas associated with congenital or blue nevi, along with Spitz melanoma, are not linked to UV exposure. Melanomas on sun-exposed skin are most prevalent in individuals with fair skin and poor tanning ability.\n\nLow-CSD melanomas, including superficial spreading melanoma and low-CSD nodular melanoma, typically arise on intermittently sun-exposed areas such as the back and proximal extremities, often in individuals younger than 55. These melanomas are linked to UV radiation from sunlight or tanning beds and frequently develop from common or dysplastic nevi, progressing through a rapid transition or inverse progression cascade. Histopathologically, the lesions are characterized by nested proliferation and pagetoid scatter of large neoplastic melanocytes with dusty cytoplasmic melanin pigmentation. Genomic alterations predominantly include\nBRAF\np.V600E mutations, along with\nCDKN2A\ninactivation and\nTERT\npromoter mutations.\n\nHigh-CSD melanomas, such as lentigo maligna melanoma and high-CSD nodular melanoma, occur on chronically sun-exposed skin, including the face and distal extremities, and are more common in individuals older than 55. These melanomas often arise from MIS and are associated with extensive solar elastosis. Histologically, neoplastic melanocytes display a lentiginous growth pattern, appearing smaller, with minimal cytoplasm and reduced pigment (see\nImage.\nLentigo Maligna with Invasive Melanoma). Patients frequently present with concurrent sun-induced lesions such as actinic keratoses and SCC. Genomic alterations include\nBRAF\np.V600K and other non-p.V600E mutations, biallelic\nNF1\ninactivation, as well as\nNRAS\nand\nKIT\nmutations.\n\nDesmoplastic melanoma is a distinct variant that manifests as an intradermal, sarcomatoid spindle cell proliferation, commonly developing on severely sun-damaged skin. This neoplasm has a high mutation burden with a strong UV radiation signature and frequently harbors\nNF1\ninactivation and other MAPK pathway-activating mutations. While it predominantly occurs in areas with severe elastosis, desmoplastic melanoma can also arise in acral or mucosal sites, sharing genomic characteristics with melanomas from those locations.\n[30]\nOn IHC studies, the tumor is typically positive for S100 protein, SOX10, and nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) but negative for HMB45 and melan-A. Additionally, PRAME expression has been observed in 35% of cases.\n[31]\n\nMelanomas that arise at sun-shielded sites or without a known UV radiation association include biologically distinct subtypes with unique clinical, histopathological, and molecular features. These tumors often lack the classic UV-induced mutational signatures seen in cutaneous melanomas and may be influenced by alternative pathogenic mechanisms, such as genetic fusions or mechanical trauma.\n\nSpitz melanoma, also known as malignant Spitz tumor, represents the malignant end of a spectrum that includes benign Spitz nevi and intermediate Spitz melanocytomas, also called \"atypical Spitz tumors\" (ASTs). Spitz melanoma often presents as a growing or changing amelanotic or pigmented plaque, papule, or nodule. These tumors are generally larger than Spitz nevi or ASTs, with most exceeding 6 mm and often surpassing 10 mm.\n[32]\n\nHistologically, the lesions consist of nests of large spindle or epithelioid melanocytes with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm extending from the epidermis into the reticular dermis in a wedge-shaped configuration. While this pattern resembles Spitz nevi, Spitz melanomas exhibit greater atypia and typically lack solar elastosis or UV-related mutational signatures. Common genetic alterations include\nHRAS\nmutations and kinase fusions such as MAP3K8.\n[33]\n\nThe term \"spitzoid\" describes tumors with Spitz-like morphology but without characteristic Spitz-associated genetic fusions. In cases with highly atypical features, identifying chromosomal copy number aberrations or mutations in\nBRAF\n,\nNRAS\n,\nNF1\n, or the\nTERT\npromoter can support a diagnosis of melanoma over Spitz melanocytoma.\n[34]\nOn IHC tests, Spitz melanomas may display deep, rather than stratified, HMB-45 staining and patchy rather than diffuse melan-A expression, while p16 expression is often lost, and the Ki-67 proliferation index is frequently above 20%.\n[35]\n\nAcral melanoma arises on glabrous skin, including the palms, soles, and nail apparatus, and is not associated with sun exposure. Chronic mechanical trauma has been suggested as a contributing factor. The most common subtype is acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM), followed by nodular melanoma and low-CSD superficial spreading melanoma (SSM).\n\nHistologically,\nin situ\nALM is characterized by an increased number of irregularly distributed basal melanocytes with hyperchromatic nuclei and prominent dendrites, progressing to confluence and eventual dermal invasion (see\nImage.\nIn Situ\nAcral Lentiginous Melanoma). Acral melanomas generally have a low tumor mutation burden but frequently harbor oncogenic mutations in\nBRAF\n,\nNRAS\n,\nKIT\n, and\nNF1\n, along with recurrent amplifications of\nCCND1, TERT, CDK4, GAB2,\nand\nMDM2\n.\n[36]\nOn IHC testing, SOX10 and MITF help assess intraepidermal melanocyte density and distribution in early lesions, while SOX10 and S100 are preferred for delineating melanocytes in desmoplastic acral melanoma.\n\nAdnexal Neoplasms\n\nCutaneous adnexal tumors are a diverse and complex group of neoplasms that differentiate into 1 or more types of skin appendages, including sweat gland, follicular, sebaceous, or mixed differentiation. Sweat gland tumors make up the largest subgroup, followed by hair follicle and sebaceous tumors. These neoplasms may present as solitary lesions or multiple papules, nodules, and plaques, with syndromic cases typically exhibiting multiple lesions. Diagnosis can be challenging due to their tendency to form cysts and the existence of pigmented variants.\n\nSweat gland tumors\n\nSweat gland tumors are classified based on their apocrine or eccrine differentiation and exhibit a broad spectrum of behaviors, ranging from indolent to highly metastatic. These lesions typically present as solitary or multiple papules, nodules, or plaques and are most commonly found in the head and neck region due to the high density of sweat glands in these areas. Diagnosis relies primarily on microscopic examination, as clinical presentation can be highly variable. While irregular borders, color variation, induration, and ulceration often suggest malignancy, benign tumors can also exhibit these characteristics.\n\nClassifying sweat gland tumors is challenging due to overlapping characteristics, requiring distinct histological findings for accurate differentiation. These tumors are broadly categorized into low-grade and high-grade types. Low-grade tumors exhibit locally destructive growth with a risk of recurrence but have low metastatic potential, whereas high-grade tumors pose a significant risk of metastasis and disease-related mortality.\n\nAmong benign sweat gland tumors, eccrine poromas are characterized histologically by small, round, basophilic poroid cells interspersed with eosinophilic squamoid cuticular cells. Syringomas typically present as multiple small, flesh-colored to yellowish papules on the lower eyelids and cheeks, featuring ducts embedded in a fibrous stroma (see\nImage.\nSyringoma). Hidradenomas, such as nodular hidradenoma, usually appear as solitary, firm nodules with both cystic and solid areas containing clear and dark cells (see\nImage.\nHidradenoma). These benign tumors are generally asymptomatic but may be excised to improve cosmesis or reduce discomfort.\n\nPorocarcinoma, the most common malignant sweat gland tumor, originates from the eccrine sweat glands. Histopathologically, this neoplasm is characterized by atypical poroid cells and ductal structures and often presents as a rapidly growing nodule or ulcer with potential for regional and distant metastasis (see\nImage\n. Porocarcinoma). Other notable malignant sweat gland tumors include adenoid cystic carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma, hidradenocarcinoma, and apocrine carcinoma.\n\nAdenoid cystic carcinoma consists of basaloid cells forming cribriform and tubular structures, with a high risk of local recurrence and perineural invasion (see\nImage\n. Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma). Mucinous carcinoma is distinguished by clusters of tumor cells floating in pools of mucin and is most commonly found on the head and neck (see\nImage\n. Primary Cutaneous Mucinous Carcinoma). Hidradenocarcinoma is an aggressive tumor characterized by pleomorphic cells and high mitotic activity. Apocrine carcinoma arises in areas rich in apocrine glands, such as the axilla and anogenital region, and features large cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm.\n\nFollicular tumors\n\nFollicular tumors arise from the hair follicle, which consists of a matrix, inner and outer root sheaths of clear cells, and connections to sebaceous and apocrine glands. The follicle’s distinct mesenchyme includes the follicular papilla and perifollicular hair sheath. A key challenge in dermatopathology is distinguishing benign follicular tumors from BCC, with ongoing debate regarding whether BCC should be classified as an epidermal or follicular tumor.\n\nTrichoblastoma, a benign follicular tumor, presents as a well-circumscribed dermal lesion composed of epithelial cell aggregates and characteristic follicular stroma, lacking the peritumoral clefting seen in BCC (see\nImage\n. Trichoblastoma). BCC itself exhibits various histological subtypes, including nodular, superficial, infiltrative, and special variants such as the Pinkus tumor. Nodular basaloid proliferations with peripheral palisading and peritumoral clefting define the lesion.\n\nOther benign follicular tumors, such as trichofolliculoma and sebaceous gland tumors, also require differentiation from BCC (see\nImage\n. Trichofolliculoma). IHC studies, such as anti-Ber-Ep4 staining, aid in this distinction by highlighting follicular structures present in both BCC and trichoblastoma. Differentiating sclerosing BCC from MAC can be particularly challenging, but anti-Ber-Ep4 staining helps, as MAC exhibits minimal to no staining.\n\nSebaceous gland tumors\n\nSebaceous gland tumors are diverse and can be classified into 3 main categories: sebaceoma, low-grade sebaceous carcinoma (LGSC) or borderline sebaceous neoplasm (BSN), and sebaceous carcinoma. These tumors commonly arise on the palpebral and extraocular skin and may be associated with Muir-Torre syndrome.\n[37]\n\nSebaceoma is a benign neoplasm with a well-defined architecture and no cellular atypia. Low-grade sebaceous carcinoma or borderline sebaceous neoplasm represents an intermediate malignancy characterized by a well-organized structure but with nuclear atypia. Sebaceous carcinoma, the malignant counterpart, exhibits invasive growth and marked nuclear atypia.\n\nHistopathologically, sebaceoma presents as well-circumscribed lobules in the dermis with mature sebaceous differentiation, lacking pleomorphism or mitotic activity. In contrast, sebaceous carcinoma features pleomorphic cells, mitotic figures, and areas of necrosis (see\nImage\n. Sebaceous Carcinoma). IHC markers such as adipophilin, known for its high sensitivity and specificity, aid in diagnosing sebaceous carcinoma.\n[38]\n\nMixed-differentiation tumors\n\nMixed differentiation tumors are a subset of cutaneous adnexal tumors characterized by features of multiple skin appendages, including apocrine, eccrine, follicular, and sometimes sebaceous differentiation. The complex histological composition of these neoplasms makes them relatively rare and diagnostically challenging, as they exhibit overlapping morphological features that can complicate classification.\n\nNeoplasms of the Nail Unit\n\nNail neoplasms include both benign and malignant growths arising from the nail or periungual tissues, often causing nail deformities and growth disturbances. Malignant tumors tend to infiltrate and disrupt surrounding structures, whereas benign tumors generally preserve adjacent tissue integrity. The unique anatomy of the nail unit, which comprises the nail plate, nail bed, and matrix, makes predicting and evaluating nail tumors particularly challenging.\n\nThese tumors are broadly classified as benign or malignant. Common benign tumors, such as onychomatricoma, glomus tumor, and pyogenic granuloma, typically maintain the structural integrity of surrounding tissues but may occasionally involve the underlying bone. Malignant tumors, including melanoma and SCC, can mimic benign conditions such as benign melanonychia or onychomycosis, creating significant diagnostic challenges. Early detection of melanoma is critical due to its aggressive nature, while SCC may also resemble benign lesions, increasing the risk of misdiagnosis.\n[39]\n\nHematolymphoid Neoplasms\n\nThe skin may be affected by hematological malignancies either as a secondary manifestation of systemic disease or as the primary site of involvement. When evaluating a skin lesion with hematopoietic cell infiltration, both architectural patterns and cytologic morphology must be assessed. An initial IHC panel is crucial for characterizing the infiltrating cells and refining the differential diagnosis.\n\nMyeloid neoplasms\n\nCutaneous mastocytosis is a form of mastocytosis that primarily affects the skin without histologically apparent involvement of other organs and is most commonly seen in pediatric patients. In contrast, cutaneous lesions in systemic mastocytosis, often in the setting of indolent systemic mastocytosis, typically present in adulthood.\n[40]\nA bone marrow biopsy is generally recommended alongside a skin biopsy in suspected cases of mastocytosis to evaluate potential systemic involvement.\n\nCutaneous mastocytosis includes maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis (MPCM), diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis (DCM), and mastocytoma. Skin biopsies reveal varying numbers of dermal mast cells, which may be detected using Giemsa, toluidine blue, mast cell tryptase, or KIT (CD117) staining (see\nImage\n. Mastocytosis). In maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis, mast cells are loosely scattered, often aggregating around blood vessels and adnexal structures in the upper dermis. Diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis is characterized by a marked increase in mast cells, whereas mastocytomas display nodular mast cell infiltrates. On H&E staining, mast cells appear as unremarkable histiocytoid cells, while Giemsa staining may highlight spindle-shaped-to-round mast cells with hypergranulated cytoplasm, indicating a well-differentiated morphology.\n[41]\n\nMyeloid sarcoma is a rare condition characterized by 1 or more tumor masses composed of immature myeloid cells at an extramedullary site. The skin is the most common site of presentation (28.2%), followed by the lymph nodes.\n[42]\n\nCutaneous myeloid sarcoma disrupts normal skin architecture, with immature myeloid cells diffusely infiltrating the dermis or subcutaneous tissue while sparing the epidermis (grenz zone). These neoplastic cells are typically medium to large with fine chromatin and prominent nucleoli.\n\nThe IHC profile of myeloid sarcoma varies depending on the degree of differentiation (monocytic versus granulocytic) and maturation (blasts versus maturing myeloid cells) within the myeloid lineage. Neoplastic cells generally express CD43, CD68, and myeloperoxidase (~90%). Myeloid neoplasms with monocytic differentiation often lack CD34 or CD117, whereas those with granulocytic differentiation typically express these markers. Additionally, approximately 40% of myeloid sarcomas exhibit abnormal cytoplasmic nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) expression, which is associated with monocytic differentiation.\n[43]\n\nHistiocytic neoplasms\n\nHistiocytoses are rare disorders characterized by the accumulation of macrophage-, dendritic cell-, or monocyte-derived cells in various tissues. These conditions exhibit a broad spectrum of clinical presentations, ranging from localized skin lesions to multisystem involvement. C.M. Luder et al have classified the cutaneous manifestations of histiocytoses into 3 groups.\n\nThe Langerhans group includes Langerhans cell histiocytosis, which presents with eczematous, psoriasiform, or acneiform lesions. Histologically, Langerhans cell histiocytosis is characterized by S100- and CD1a-positive cells, often harboring\nBRAF\np.V600E mutations, indicating a neoplastic origin from bone marrow-derived monocytes. This condition primarily affects children but can also occur in adults.\n\nThe cutaneous and mucocutaneous histiocytosis group includes juvenile xanthogranuloma, necrobiotic xanthogranuloma, and multicentric reticulohistiocytosis. These conditions present with diverse skin findings, from small nodular lesions in juvenile xanthogranuloma to indurated plaques in necrobiotic xanthogranuloma. Juvenile xanthogranuloma is typically benign and primarily affects children, whereas necrobiotic xanthogranuloma is associated with monoclonal gammopathies, and multicentric reticulohistiocytosis affects adults, often leading to destructive arthritis. These histiocytoses typically stain positively for CD68 and negatively for S100, CD1a, and Langerin.\n\nThe Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD) and related histiocytoses (R group) include RDD, which presents with massive lymphadenopathy and cutaneous lesions. Histologically, the lesions are positive for S100 and CD68 but negative for CD1a. RDD primarily affects children and young adults, while the cutaneous form shows a predilection for older women.\n[44]\n\nCutaneous B-cell neoplasms\n\nPrimary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas (PCBCL) account for approximately 20% to 25% of all primary cutaneous lymphomas (PCLs).\n[45]\nAccording to the most recent WHO Classification of Tumors, 5th edition, the 3 most common types are primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma (PCMZL), primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma (PCFCL), and primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type (PCDLBCL-LT). While PCMZL and PCFCL typically exhibit indolent behavior, PCDLBCL-LT is more aggressive.\n[46]\nIn addition to these PCBCLs, cutaneous B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders may also arise from secondary involvement by other B-cell lymphomas, including mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), Burkitt lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL).\n\nThe initial approach to significant lymphatic infiltration in the skin generally involves immunophenotyping. A typical antibody panel includes CD20, CD3, and CD30, addressing the most prevalent cutaneous lymphoproliferations. Prominent dermal lymphatic infiltration rich in CD20-positive B cells is typically absent in normal skin except in reactive B-cell follicles associated with cutaneous pseudolymphomas. Evaluating intradermal B-cell infiltration requires careful assessment of cytology and growth patterns to refine the differential diagnosis, guiding the selection of an appropriate staining panel.\n[47]\n\nOschlies et al described 3 distinct patterns of PCBCL. The 1st pattern, follicular or nodular dermal infiltration, is the most common and features mixed cellularity, with varying numbers of plasma cells and large cells. This pattern is also the most challenging to assess. The primary differential diagnoses include PCFCL, PCMZL, pseudolymphomas, and B cell-rich primary cutaneous small/medium-sized CD4+ T-cell lymphomas.\n\nA crucial diagnostic indicator is the presence of clonal B-cell receptor (BCR) gene rearrangement without clonal T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement. Secondary skin manifestations of systemic B-cell lymphomas, such as systemic follicular lymphoma (SFL) and marginal zone lymphoma/lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (MZL/LPL), as well as nodular or perivascular minor infiltrations by CLL or rare cases of MCL, should also be considered in the differential diagnosis.\n\nThe 2nd pattern, diffuse dermal infiltration by small- to medium-sized B cells, is rare but easily identifiable as neoplastic. Reactive B-cell infiltrations with dense dermal diffuse B cells are uncommon, in contrast to reactive dense dermal T-cell infiltrations, such as in Jessner lymphocytic infiltration of the skin. Differential diagnoses include PCBCLs, specifically diffuse variants of PCFCL and PCMZL, as well as secondary manifestations of CLL. Rarer occurrences of systemic follicular lymphoma, MZL/LPL, and MCL should also be considered.\n\nThe 3rd pattern, diffuse sheet-like dermal infiltration by large or blastic B cells, is rare and generally straightforward to diagnose due to its clear neoplastic nature. The most common differential diagnosis in this scenario is PCDLBCL-LT. However, other differential diagnoses must still be excluded, including blastic/pleomorphic variants of MCL and large cell/spindle cell-rich variants of PCFCL. While PCDLBCL-LT and blastic MCL are rarely diagnosed in children or younger individuals, precursor B lymphoblastic lymphoma should be considered in these age groups.\n\nOther exceptional differential diagnoses include CD20 coexpressing large-cell T-cell lymphomas and nonhematological neoplasms, such as MCC expressing B-cell markers. Furthermore, the potential association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) must be excluded in patients with an underlying immunodeficiency.\n\nCutaneous T-cell neoplasms\n\nThe majority (75%-80%) of all PCLs are cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs). Among CTCLs, mycosis fungoides is the most common type, accounting for 60% of CTCLs and nearly 50% of all PCLs. Following mycosis fungoides, primary cutaneous CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs), including lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) and primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (PC-ALCL), are also prevalent. While both LyP and PC-ALCL feature an infiltrate of medium-to-large atypical CD30+ neoplastic T cells, their clinical presentations and courses differ significantly, representing different ends of the same disease spectrum.\n[48]\n\nMycosis fungoides typically progresses through stages of patches, plaques, and tumors, each with distinct histological features. Key histological clues for diagnosing this condition include a range of epidermal changes, from hyperplastic to atrophic, often accompanied by parakeratosis. Epidermotropism of lymphocytes is a hallmark, characterized by lymphocytes appearing as single elements or in aggregates, without consensual spongiosis, and forming Pautrier microabscesses. Additionally, haloed intraepidermal lymphocytes, marked by clearings around the cells, often align along the dermal-epidermal junction. These intraepidermal lymphocytes are typically larger than intradermal lymphocytes and exhibit hyperchromatic, irregular nuclei (see\nImage\n. Mycosis Fungoides).\n[49]\n\nVariants of mycosis fungoides include folliculotropic mycosis fungoides (FMF), pagetoid reticulosis, and granulomatous slack skin (GSS).\n[50]\nClassic mycosis fungoides generally demonstrates a CD2-positive, CD3-positive, TCR β-positive, CD5-positive, CD4-positive, CD8-negative, and CD30-positive/negative phenotype, with CD7 often dimly expressed or partially lost, particularly in advanced stages.\n[51]\nMost cases also express cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA) and CCR4.\n[52]\n\nLyP is a skin disorder that typically self-regresses but tends to relapse, characterized by papulonodular lesions that can sometimes become necrotic. Histological features vary significantly depending on the stage of the skin lesion biopsied.\n[53]\nFive histologic types of LyP have been identified based on the predominant cell type and tropism: A, B, C, D, and E. Subtypes A, B, and C predominantly express CD4, while subtypes D and E express CD8.\n[54]\nAdditionally, LyP with\nDUSP22-IRF4\nrearrangement often presents with a double-negative CD4/CD8 phenotype.\n[55]\nA characteristic perinuclear, dot-like Golgi staining pattern is observed in the large atypical lymphoid cells in 50% of LyP cases.\n[56]\n\nPC-ALCL typically presents as a solitary, localized red-brown nodule or papule (>2 cm) or, in some cases, multifocal lesions with occasional ulceration and rare spontaneous regression, which contrasts with LyP. PC-ALCL is characterized by a diffuse dermal infiltrate of medium to large anaplastic, pleomorphic, or immunoblastic cells without epidermotropism, often displaying an angiocentric distribution. A key histological feature of PC-ALCL is the presence of large cells (15-50 µm) with eccentric kidney-shaped nuclei, multiple small basophilic nucleoli, and abundant amphophilic or basophilic cytoplasm with a prominent eosinophilic Golgi region. The neoplastic cells often express cytotoxic proteins, such as granzyme B, T-cell intracellular antigen 1 (TIA-1), and perforin, along with variable loss of CD2, CD3, CD5, and CD7.\n[57]\n\nMesenchymal (Soft Tissue) Neoplasms\n\nMesenchymal tumors typically develop in deep soft tissues and are rarely found in the skin or subcutaneous layers. Cutaneous sarcomas, which are an uncommon type of skin tumor, are much less frequent than carcinomas and benign mesenchymal skin neoplasms.\n[58]\nWhile various deep tissue mesenchymal neoplasms can present superficially, some tumors, such as cellular neurothekeoma, hobnail hemangioma, microvenular hemangioma, and DFSP, are exclusively superficial and do not have deep tissue counterparts.\n\nDespite being the same entity, superficial mesenchymal neoplasms and their deep-seated counterparts can differ in both morphology and disease prognosis. For example, the rare leiomyoma of deep soft tissues typically presents as a well-defined nodular neoplasm, whereas pilar leiomyoma is a poorly defined, infiltrative lesion that may mimic more aggressive mesenchymal tumors. In comparison to deep tissue sarcomas, most cutaneous sarcomas generally have a more favorable prognosis, regardless of their morphological grade of malignancy.\n[59]\nMesenchymal tumors are generally categorized based on their origin into several types. These categories include adipocytic, fibrohistiocytic, vascular, smooth muscle, neural, and tumors of uncertain differentiation.\n\nCommon benign adipocytic tumors include lipoma, angiolipoma, and spindle cell lipoma. An atypical lipomatous tumor (ALT) is considered a borderline tumor, while pleomorphic sarcoma represents a malignant tumor. Lipoma is characterized by lobular proliferation of mature adipocytes without atypia. Angiolipomas typically present as multiple small, tender subcutaneous nodules and consist of mature adipocytes interspersed with capillary vessels and fibrin microthrombi.\n[60]\n\nSpindle cell lipoma presents as a painless nodule composed of varying proportions of mature adipocytes, bland spindle cells, and ropy collagen. ALT consists of mature adipocytes and atypical stromal cells with hyperchromasia. The amplification of\nMDM2\nis a distinguishing feature of ALT, setting it apart from other benign adipose tumors.\n[61]\nIn contrast, pleomorphic sarcoma is characterized by pleomorphic spindle cell sarcoma, pleomorphic lipoblasts, absence of\nMDM2\namplification, and a complex karyotype.\n[62]\n\nDermatofibroma, also known as fibrous histiocytoma, is a common benign lesion that typically appears as a solitary, dome-shaped nodule with hyperpigmentation. Microscopically, this pathology is found in the reticular dermis and often presents as a round, nonencapsulated, poorly defined lesion. Key histological features include a storiform pattern of spindle cells arranged in a whorled or cartwheel-like pattern, usually surrounded by collagen, with areas of sclerosis. The tumor cells typically have small, oval-to-spindle-shaped nuclei with inconspicuous nucleoli, and mitotic figures are sparse (see\nImage.\nDermatofibroma).\n[63]\n\nDFSP is an intermediate lesion with a typically indolent course. This condition usually presents as a painless, firm, slow-growing plaque or nodule that may exhibit various discolorations. In its early stage, known as preprotuberans, the lesion has nonspecific features and is often misdiagnosed.\n[64]\n\nDFSP is characterized by poorly circumscribed tumors that infiltrate the entire dermis, destroying preexisting structures and spreading into the subcutaneous tissue. This infiltration often displays a \"honeycomb\" pattern in the subcutaneous fat. The primary histologic feature is a dense, uniform array of spindle-shaped cells embedded in collagen, usually arranged in a storiform pattern. Mitotic figures are typically infrequent (see\nImage.\nDermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans).\n\nDFSP is classified into various subtypes based on histological presentation. Most classic DFSP cases exhibit diffuse positive CD34 staining, which serves as a key diagnostic marker.\n[65]\n[66]\nAdditionally, identifying the\nCOL1A1-PDGFB\nrearrangement through molecular testing strongly supports a diagnosis of DFSP.\n[67]\n\nCommon benign vascular tumors include angiokeratoma, lymphangioma, and hemangioma, which has various subtypes. Angiokeratoma is marked by the proliferation of dilated thin-walled vessels in the papillary dermis, accompanied by variable epidermal changes. Hemangiomas can usually be easily identified, but distinguishing them from malformations can be challenging. Angiosarcoma must be ruled out if atypia is present, especially in radiation-associated cases, including those following breast cancer treatment.\n[68]\n\nCutaneous smooth muscle tumors are rare and primarily benign, including smooth muscle hamartoma, cutaneous leiomyoma, and EBV-associated smooth muscle tumor (EBV-SMT). Atypical intradermal smooth muscle neoplasm is classified as an intermediate neoplasm. Smooth muscle hamartoma is characterized by haphazardly arranged dermal bundles of mature smooth muscle near the pilosebaceous units.\n[69]\n\nCutaneous leiomyoma, also known as pilar leiomyoma, originates from the arrector pili smooth muscle in the dermis and presents as a poorly defined nodule composed of well-differentiated smooth muscle bundles. These tumors are typically highlighted by smooth muscle actin (SMA), desmin, and caldesmon staining. EBV-associated smooth muscle tumors occur mainly in immunocompromised individuals and present as well-circumscribed tumors with interlacing fascicles of spindle-shaped myoid cells.\n[70]\nGiven their similarity to other smooth muscle tumors, EBV-encoded RNA\nin situ\nhybridization (EBER-ISH) testing is recommended for immunocompromised patients. Atypical intradermal smooth muscle neoplasms share histological features with cutaneous leiomyoma but show more atypical and mitotic figures.\n\nBenign cutaneous neural tumors include neuroma, Schwannoma, neurofibroma, and granular cell tumor, while malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a malignant neoplasm. Solitary circumscribed neuroma presents as a small dermal nodule, with fascicles of bland spindle cells encapsulated by a fine capsule. This arrangement creates artifactual clefts at the tumor-stromal interface.\n[71]\nNeurofibromas are characterized by an infiltrative, hypocellular spindle cell lesion with a myxoid to collagenous stroma. These lesions are positive for S100 in neoplastic cells and display a characteristic stromal \"fingerprint\" pattern highlighted by CD34 (see\nImage.\nNeurofibroma).\n[72]\n\nSchwannomas typically exhibit classic Antoni A or Antoni B areas. These tumors are composed of spindle-shaped cells arranged in distinctive patterns. Granular cell tumors consist of epithelioid cells with abundant granular eosinophilic cytoplasm. These cells stain diffusely positive for S100 and SOX10, aiding in their identification.\n\nMPNSTs typically arise from a benign nerve sheath tumor and are distinguished by spindle cells with marked cellular atypia. These cells are arranged in fascicles or whorls. Unlike benign neurofibromas, MPNSTs lack a myxoid background and Schwannian differentiation. The lesions exhibit high mitotic activity and show patchy or focal expression of S100 and SOX10.\n\nTumors of uncertain differentiation\n\nA cutaneous tumor of uncertain differentiation refers to a type of skin tumor whose cellular origin and lineage cannot be definitively determined based on histologic and IHC findings. These tumors are difficult to classify because they do not exhibit clear characteristics typical of specific cell types or tissue origins within the skin.\n\nBenign examples of these tumors include cellular neurothekeoma, epithelioid fibrous histiocytoma, and perivascular epithelioid cell tumor (PEComa). Intermediate tumors include angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma,\nNTRK\n-rearranged spindle cell neoplasm, atypical fibroxanthoma, and superficial CD34+ fibroblastic tumor. Malignant neoplasms within this category include pleomorphic dermal sarcoma, epithelioid sarcoma, dermal clear cell sarcoma, and Ewing sarcoma.\n\nMetastases to the Skin\n\nCutaneous metastases typically result from hematogenous spread of an internal cancer. These lesions occur in 0.5% to 10.4% of patients with cancer and, in some cases, may be the first indication of the primary tumor before it is identified.\n[73]\nThe most common sources of cutaneous metastases are breast cancer in women and melanoma in men, followed by lung, colon, head and neck, ovarian, and renal cancers.\n[74]\n\nMicroscopically, cutaneous metastases are generally located in the dermis, sparing the epidermis, and tend to share morphological features with the primary tumor.\n[75]\nFor example, breast carcinoma metastases often present with solid or nested neoplastic cells that form ductal patterns and test positive for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and mammaglobin.\n[76]\n\nDistinguishing cutaneous metastatic melanoma from primary dermal melanoma can be challenging. Metastatic melanoma cells are confined to the dermis, lack an overlying precursor lesion, and extend into the deep dermis. These cells often show little pigmentation and test positive for S100 or SOX10, though staining for melan-A and HMB-45 can vary.\n[77]\n\nLung adenocarcinoma metastases typically present as moderately differentiated tumors, forming solid nests, sheets, and cords of cells without an epidermal connection. These metastases can be confirmed with positivity for TTF-1 and CK7. On the other hand, small cell carcinoma metastases retain neuroendocrine features, showing positivity for TTF-1 and CAM5.2 but negativity for CK7 and CK20.\n[78]\n\nInherited Disorders Associated with Skin Tumors\n\nInherited disorders that predispose individuals to skin tumors are often caused by genetic mutations impacting tumor suppressor genes, DNA repair mechanisms, and other essential regulatory pathways. These disorders typically result in a higher incidence of various skin tumors, along with systemic manifestations.\n\nFamilial melanoma\n\nFamilial melanoma is often linked to mutations in the\nCDKN2A\ngene, which encodes proteins that regulate the cell cycle and prevent uncontrolled cell proliferation. As a result, patients frequently develop multiple primary melanomas at a younger age compared to sporadic cases, with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer.\n[79]\nHistopathologically, melanomas in familial cases exhibit typical features, including asymmetry, irregular borders, multiple colors, and a high mitotic rate.\n\nBAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome\n\nThis syndrome results from mutations in the\nBAP1\ngene, which encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme involved in chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. Affected individuals often present with multiple atypical Spitz tumors, uveal melanoma, and increased risks of mesothelioma and renal cell carcinoma.\n[80]\nHistopathologically,\nBAP1\n-mutated melanocytic tumors demonstrate characteristic spitzoid morphology, with epithelioid and spindle cells, as well as nuclear pleomorphism.\n\nXeroderma pigmentosum\n\nXeroderma pigmentosum is caused by mutations in genes responsible for nucleotide excision repair (NER), leading to an inability to repair UV-induced DNA damage. Xeroderma pigmentosum is characterized by extreme sensitivity to UV light, early-onset skin cancers (such as BCC, SCC, and melanoma), freckling, and atrophic skin changes.\n[81]\nHistopathologically, skin biopsies from xeroderma pigmentosum patients reveal solar elastosis, actinic keratoses, and a range of skin cancers, often presenting in multiples and with atypical features.\n\nNevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (Gorlin Syndrome)\n\nGorlin syndrome is caused by mutations in the\nPTCH1\ngene, which is part of the Hedgehog signaling pathway and plays a role in regulating cell growth.\n[82]\nPatients with Gorlin syndrome develop multiple BCCs at a young age, as well as jaw cysts and skeletal abnormalities.\n[83]\nHistopathologically, BCCs in this syndrome exhibit typical features such as nests of basaloid cells with peripheral palisading and stromal retraction.\n\nCarney complex\n\nCarney complex is caused by mutations in the\nPRKAR1A\ngene, which affects protein kinase A signaling and regulates cell proliferation.\n[84]\nPatients often present with lentigines, blue nevi, myxomas, and endocrine overactivity, with an increased risk of cardiac myxomas and extracutaneous tumors.\n[85]\nHistopathologically, skin lesions like blue nevi display nests of pigmented dendritic melanocytes, while myxomas show myxoid stroma interspersed with spindle cells.\n\nMuir-Torre syndrome\n\nMuir-Torre syndrome is associated with mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes (\nMLH1, MSH2, MSH6\n), leading to microsatellite instability.\n[86]\nPatients typically develop sebaceous gland tumors, including adenomas, epitheliomas, and carcinomas, as well as keratoacanthomas, and have an increased risk of internal malignancies such as colorectal cancer. Histopathologically, sebaceous tumors exhibit lobules of sebocytes with varying degrees of differentiation, while keratoacanthomas feature well-differentiated squamous epithelium and a central keratin plug.\n\nBrooke-Spiegler and related syndromes\n\nThese syndromes involve mutations in the\nCYLD\ngene, which encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme that regulates the NF-κB pathway.\n[87]\nAffected individuals often develop multiple cylindromas, trichoepitheliomas, and spiradenomas, usually from a young age.\n[88]\nHistopathologically, cylindromas are composed of basaloid cells arranged in a jigsaw puzzle pattern, trichoepitheliomas show nests of basaloid cells resembling hair follicles, and spiradenomas contain basaloid and epithelial cells with ductal differentiation."
