Serotonin syndrome is a rare but serious and potentially fatal condition thought to result from hyperstimulation of brainstem 5-HT1A and 2A receptors. Symptoms of the serotonin syndrome may include mental status changes such as irritability, altered consciousness, confusion, hallucinations, and coma; autonomic dysfunction such as tachycardia, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, shivering, blood pressure lability, and mydriasis; neuromuscular abnormalities such as hyperreflexia, myoclonus, tremor, rigidity, and ataxia; and gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

Treatment with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists has been associated with dose-dependent prolongation of the QT interval. Theoretically, coadministration with other agents that can prolong the QT interval including certain antidepressants and lithium may result in additive effects and increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes and sudden death.', 'DDInter', 'Caution is advised if 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are prescribed with other agents that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system. Patients should be closely monitored for symptoms of the serotonin syndrome during treatment. Particular caution is warranted when initiating or increasing the dosages of these agents. In addition, the potential risk for serotonin syndrome should be considered even when administering serotonergic agents sequentially, as some agents may demonstrate a prolonged elimination half-life. If serotonin syndrome develops or is suspected during the course of therapy, all serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately and supportive care rendered as necessary. Moderately ill patients may also benefit from the administration of a serotonin antagonist (e.g., cyproheptadine, chlorpromazine). Severe cases should be managed under consultation with a toxicologist and may require sedation, neuromuscular paralysis, intubation, and mechanical ventilation in addition to the other measures. Due to the potential for additive effects on the QT interval, ECG monitoring may also be appropriate when 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are used with certain antidepressants or lithium. Patients should be advised to seek prompt medical attention if they experience symptoms that could indicate the occurrence of torsade de pointes such as dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, palpitation, irregular heart rhythm, shortness of breath, or syncope.', 'Synergism', 'Caution is advised if 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are prescribed with other agents that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system.', 'Major', 'pharmacodynamic', NULL, 'https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/158271/', '', 'Viloxazine, Esketamine', 'Aprepitant', 1767369485);
