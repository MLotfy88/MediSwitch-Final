The risk of systemic anticholinergic effects following topical administration depends on variables such as strength of the product, size of the application area, frequency of application, and use of occlusive dressing. Systemic effects are uncommon following oral inhalation or nasal administration due to the poor absorption of quaternary ammonium compounds from gastrointestinal and nasal mucosa.",

In patients who have previously been treated with immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive drugs, consider potential additive effect, mode of action, and duration of effect of the other drugs prior to initiation of cladribine. Patients should be advised to contact their physician if they develop signs and symptoms of infection such as fever, chills, diarrhea, sore throat, muscle aches, shortness of breath, blood in phlegm, weight loss, red or inflamed skin, body sores, and pain or burning during urination.",
