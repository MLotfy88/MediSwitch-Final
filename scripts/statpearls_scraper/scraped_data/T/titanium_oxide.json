    "clinical_significance": "Advantages of Spectacle Correction of the Ametropias\n\nSpectacle lenses are advantageous because they: can improve vision and visual performance, especially in cases of severe ametropia and in myopes; can improve symptoms of headaches and eye strains in hypermetropia; may be equipped with anti-UV and protective coatings for outdoor and computer use; have widespread acceptability in society; are available for practically any age; are generally affordable, and are the most durable eye care management options for ametropia.\n[41]\n\nDisadvantages of Spectacle Correction of the Ametropias\n\nSpectacle lenses can be limiting, considering that they: can only correct ametropias as long as they are being worn; may leave undesirable physical discomfort on the head, face, nose, and ears; and may not be ideal for individuals with very high prescriptions as the lenses may emerge too thick and heavy."
