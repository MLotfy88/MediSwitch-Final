    "indications": "Venous leg ulcers (VLUs) are late indicators of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) and venous hypertension.\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\nCalf muscle contraction and intraluminal valves promote prograde flow while preventing blood reflux in normal conditions.\n[5]\nHowever, when retrograde flow, obstruction, or both exist, chronic venous hypertension is responsible for the dermatologic and vascular complications that form a VLU (See\nImage\n. Venous Leg Ulcer).\n[6]\n\nVLUs are a costly medical condition that greatly affects worldwide healthcare systems.\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\nIn the United States (US), the annual cost of Medicare and commercial insurance for caring for patients with VLU is $18,986 and $13,653, respectively.\n[10]\nTogether, these represent an annual burden of $14.9 billion for the US payers, a considerable increase from a previous $1 billion estimate.\n[11]\nThe situation may worsen as the aging, obese, and sedentary population increases globally, with an expected rise in the incidence of CVI and VLUs.\n[12]",
    "mechanism": "Although CVI is a well-known precipitant for VLU development, ulceration occurs rarely (5.1%) for unclear reasons.\n[13]\nCVI may develop due to blood reflux, obstruction, or both mechanisms, causing macro- and micro-circulatory dysfunction.\n[5]\nThe increased intraluminal pressure causes protein extravasation and fibrin cuff formation, which impedes the diffusion of oxygen and growth factors and activates the inflammatory response.\n[14]\n[15]\n\nAt a cellular level, mast cell degranulation, leukocyte recruitment, increased matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, and prostacyclin, the acquisition of a non-contractile secretory phenotype by smooth muscle cells, and fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts participate in vein wall remodeling and varix formation. The proinflammatory microenvironment is maintained by M1 macrophages, mainly by releasing interleukin-1α, interferon-gamma, and transforming growth factor-beta 1. Chronic inflammation and incompetent blood flow favor thrombus formation, causing further fibrosis and valvular destruction.\n[16]\nTogether, this inflammatory cascade of events impairs healing processes, which results in ulcer formation upon wounding.\n\nMost risk factors for the development of VLUs are non-modifiable, and patients often present with more than 1. These involve a family history of CVI, advanced age, female sex, previous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, multiparity, lipodermatosclerosis, and musculoskeletal and joint disease.\n[5]\n[1]\nModifiable risk factors such as obesity and sedentarism are also associated with venous disease.\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\nGenetic traits may be an additional predisposing factor, presenting as an autosomal dominant trait with variable penetrance.\n[1]\n[14]\nHowever, a specific gene or gene set has not been determined. Forkhead box C2, located on chromosome 16q24, is a candidate marker in subjects with varicose veins.\n[20]\n\nCompared with healing VLUs, the gene expression profile of non-healing VLUs showed upregulation of secreted frizzled-related protein 4, branched-chain aminotransferase 1, dermatopontin, cytochrome P450, and 17 B hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase genes, which are involved in inflammation control, Wnt signaling, cell growth, extracellular matrix assembly, and steroidogenesis.\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\nConversely, collagen differentiation and epidermal repair genes such as collagen type 13α1, collagen 27α1, keratin 14, keratin 16, and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor were notoriously downregulated. Besides these, single nucleotide polymorphisms of high iron, ferroportin 1, and matrix metalloproteinase 12 indicate venous ulcer development susceptibility.\n[22]\n[25]\n[26]\nA gene expression study's results showed that VLUs treated with a bioengineered bilayered living cellular construct skin substitute displayed a shift from a chronic non-healing inflammatory profile to acute healing inflammation, highlighting the negative effects of chronic inflammation in wound healing.\n[27]",
    "monitoring": "Clinical assessment should describe the ulcer area, depth, edges, wound base, signs of infection, and peripheral skin changes.\n[33]\n[42]\n[34]\n[42]\n[34]\nPalpation of distal pulses and ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) are used to evaluate adequate arterial blood flow since approximately 20% of patients with VLU have coincident arterial disease. ABPI is obtained by dividing the systolic ankle pressure by the systolic arm pressure in the supine position. An ABPI greater than 1 to 1.3 is considered normal. Below this, cut-off values are used to classify disease severity and guide the appropriateness of compression therapy (see\nTable.\nAnkle-Brachial Pressure Index).\n[43]\nParadoxically, an ABPI greater than 1.3 appears in patients with significant vascular calcification, indicating the need for urgent referral to a vascular specialist.\n[43]\n\nTable\nTable. Ankle-Brachial Pressure Index .\n\nColor-flow duplex ultrasound is another inexpensive, non-invasive, and highly informative diagnostic test useful for superficial vein assessment.\n[34]\n[44]\nThe technique can identify thrombi presence and valve incompetence, declared when reflux time exceeds 0.5 seconds.\n[45]\nComputed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are preferred for deeper vessels since they are often harder or impossible to evaluate with ultrasound. Phlebography, plethysmography, and phlebodynamometry are less used due to inferior accuracy and associated risks.\n[46]\n[47]",
    "administration": "The standard of care for VLUs relies on 2 strategies: compression therapy and direct wound management.\n[36]\nReducing leg edema is crucial for the effectiveness of wound closure.\n[33]\nThere are numerous conservative alternatives aimed at improving venous hypertension, such as medical compression, intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC), manual lymphatic drainage, and extracorporeal shockwave therapy. Compression therapy is the most practical, effective, and cost-conscious intervention for the treatment of VLUs.\n[6]\n[34]\nThis involves using various types of hosiery or bandages, which can be elastic, inelastic, single- or multi-layered.\n[48]\nUnlike inelastic wraps, elastic materials provide moldable compression during rest and physical activity.\n[49]\nAccording to a Cochrane review, multi-component, stretchy systems provide superior venous ulcer healing rates compared with single-layered systems.\n[50]\nCompression strength can be light (14 to 17 mm Hg), moderate (18 to 24 mm Hg), high (23 to 35 mm Hg), or extra-high (up to 60 mm Hg). High compression is the preferred strength and should reach the knee or higher.\n[34]\nLight, cautious compression can be used in mild or significant peripheral vascular disease cases, as the ABPI indicates.\n[43]\nAbsolute contraindications for compression therapy include arterial occlusive disease, ABPI less than 0.5, serious uncontrolled high blood pressure, heart failure, suspected or documented thrombosis, extensive thrombophlebitis, and erysipelas.\n\nIPC can be used in addition to compression therapy or in patients who are unable to tolerate the latter.\n[34]\nAccording to a systematic review, normal IPC and rapid IPC were superior to dressings and slow IPC delivery, respectively.\n[51]\nLymphatic drainage and extracorporeal shockwave therapy have very low evidence in VLU treatment.\n[52]\n[53]\nAs an adjunct to compression therapy, treatment with pentoxifylline or micronized purified flavonoids is an effective ancillary measure.\n[54]\nBoth drugs have shown improved healing in various systematic reviews and meta-analyses.\n[55]\n[56]\n[57]\n[58]\nThere is insufficient evidence to recommend other systemic treatments, namely aspirin, zinc, doxycycline, calcium dobesilate, stanozolol, and cilostazol.\n[54]\n[59]\n\nDirect ulcer interventions involve cleansing, debridement, infection control, and applying dressings and topical substances.\n[38]\nCleansing should be performed with a non-toxic substance to minimize damage to the viable tissue.\n[34]\nDebridement can be achieved by surgically removing non-viable tissue, which is strongly recommended.\n[49]\nTopical or injected anesthesia can be used to minimize discomfort; autolytic dressings, larval therapy, and enzymatic agents are painless debridement options, albeit results may take longer.\n[34]\n[38]\n\nAlthough VLUs are often colonized, frank infections are less common. Systemic antibiotic therapy should be considered if the infection is suspected to be a new-onset painful ulcer with erythema, tenderness, warmth, and systemic signs (eg, fever, chills). Tissue culture (as opposed to a swab) must be performed in fetid, purulent, or non-healing wounds to guide antimicrobial therapy. Dressings maintain adequate moisture, offer physical protection, and promote granulation and reepithelization. There are numerous absorptive (eg, alginates), moisture-retaining (eg, hydrocolloids), and antiseptic materials (eg, silver) that can be applied to dry, exudative, and infected wounds, respectively. Topical treatments are typically used as antiseptics (eg, cadexomer-iodine), antimicrobials (eg, silver sulfadiazine), and debriding agents such as collagenase or hydrogels).\n\nIn a Cochrane meta-analysis, sucralfate and silver dressings were the most highly ranked treatments. Interestingly, using silver dressings increased the probability of healing (risk ratio 2.43, 95% confidence interval 1.58 to 3.74) compared with nonadherent dressings.\n[60]\nHowever, this arose from low-certainty evidence, and the authors could not establish specific treatment recommendations. The benefit-cost balance must be considered since these are often more expensive materials. Adjunctive therapies are recommended for non-improving ulcers after 4 to 6 weeks of standard treatment.\n[34]\nTissue-based products may be useful for these complicated scenarios. According to a systematic review, cultured bilayered skin grafting is more effective than conventional dressings when both were used with compression therapy; there is insufficient evidence to determine if other skin substitutes can effectively improve the healing of VLUs.\n[61]\n\nInvasive management intends to eliminate incompetent veins through various techniques, such as sclerotherapy, open vascular surgery, radiofrequency, and endovenous procedures. These are often reserved for advanced cases when standard therapies are insufficient.\n[5]\n[62]\nIn a multicenter study of 450 patients with venous leg ulcers, early endovenous ablation was associated with faster healing and a longer ulcer-free period compared to patients who had the procedure delayed until their ulcer healed or until 6 months if it remained unhealed.\n[63]",
    "adverse_effects": "As with any chronic wound, the most common complications of VLUs include infection and pain, both of which should be controlled to improve healing outcomes and patient adherence.\n[36]\n[75]\nLess frequently, skin cancer may develop in wounds that fail to improve over long periods of time.\n[65]"
