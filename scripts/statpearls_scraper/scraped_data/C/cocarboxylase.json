    "clinical_significance": "Respiratory failure is a life-threatening condition responsible for around 30% of in-hospital mortality. The definitive treatment for respiratory failure is mechanical intubation and ventilation. However, this process is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.\n[28]\nThese include complications with intubation, such as laryngospasm, bronchospasm, incorrect tube placement, aspiration, and hypotension, as well as complications from prolonged time on mechanical ventilation, including ventilator-induced lung injury, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and GI complications, including peptic ulcers and colonization of the GI tract by aerobic gram-negative bacteria. NPPV has been shown to reduce intubation in COPD, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and pneumonia and reduce the need for reintubation in hypercapnic respiratory failure following extubation. However, NPPV is a time-consuming procedure requiring high resource utilization and should only be performed under a clinician and support staff with proficiency in its use.\n\nClinical Pearls\n\nStart treatment as early as possible.\nWhen arterial pH is less than 7.35, and PaCO\n2\nis elevated, it indicates the presence of acute or acute chronic hypercapnia respiratory failure, which requires admission to the ICU.\nThe first goal is to correct arterial pH in acute or chronic hypercapnia respiratory failure.\nHigh-intensity pressure support is indicated in chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure with arterial PaCO\n2\nof more than 51 mmHg. It should be targeted to correct CO\n2\ntoward normal or at least reduced by 20% from initial levels.\nWhen OSA is suspected, the EPAP  should be adjusted empirically (use the 10% rule of actual body weight) if no PAP titration was performed."
