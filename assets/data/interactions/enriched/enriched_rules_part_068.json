Azithromycin and dirithromycin are generally believed to have little, if any, effect on CYP450 3A4.

One of the patients also had QT interval prolongation, which may be induced by elevated levels of erythromycin secondary to inhibition of intestinal P-glycoprotein and CYP450 3A4 by verapamil. The interaction was also suspected in a 53-year-old woman who was started on verapamil and clarithromycin concurrently and developed bradycardia, dizziness, hypotension and fainting after 24 hours.
