    "clinical_significance": "MMS has emerged as the gold standard for treating skin cancer across many scenarios. Mohs surgeons and their staff, involved at any stage of the procedure, must remain vigilant in promptly identifying and addressing potential complications. Timely recognition and intervention can significantly mitigate complications associated with MMS.\n\nMinimizing complications enhances clinical outcomes and fosters trust between patients and healthcare providers. Clear communication, thorough follow-up, and alignment of goals with patients are essential components in managing complications effectively. Acknowledging and taking responsibility for undesirable outcomes is crucial, as well as demonstrating a commitment to achieving satisfactory patient results. To accomplish this, surgeons must comprehensively understand management strategies for each potential complication during MMS procedures."
