    "Background": {
      "text": "Junctional tourniquets are devices that allow for proximal compression of arterial bleeding and thus control of junctional hemorrhage\nJunctional tourniquets (JTQ) were initially cleared by FDA in 2010 for use in pre-hospital medicine\nDeveloped because of limitations of traditional extremity tourniquets in controlling hemorrhage between the trunk and limbs. These difficult to access locations were responsible for 20% of preventable deaths by bleeding on the battlefield.\nTesting has shown JTQ to be 75-100% effect in controlling hemorrhage",

      "text": "Stop bleeding effectively from junction areas such as groin, pelvis, shoulder, or neck\nCompress bleeding from sites where regular TQ cannot be applied\nSafe to use\nEffective for prehospital use\nSmall with low profile\nLightweight\nLow-cost\nEasy to use requiring minimal training\nApplied quickly\nDoes not slip on tightening when in use\nProvides easy release of compression\nEasy to reapply\nLong shelf life",
