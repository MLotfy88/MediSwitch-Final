    "clinical_significance": "Before these laws were introduced, multiple harmful products entered the market, leading to bodily harm and death. Previously, under the Pure Food and Drug Act, medications only needed a list of active ingredients to be marketed. Consumers and providers were misled by claims made about medications. The FFDCA and its subsequent amendments overhauled the healthcare system, specifically the treatments available. When the Kefauver-Harris amendment was passed, it also led to a retrospective review of medications that had been introduced to the market from the time the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act was signed through when the amendment was signed into law. The Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) evaluated thousands of existing medications for proof of effectiveness for the indications the medication had been labeled to treat. Hundreds of drugs that did not meet these new standards of therapeutic effectiveness were removed from the market then.\n[5]\n\nOTC medications rely on the ability of a person with no medical training to identify their conditions or symptoms and purchase the medication to treat themselves without the aid of a healthcare provider. These individuals also need to be able to dose the medication safely. This is of particular concern regarding specialized populations such as children, pregnant women, and older adults. While OTCs are generally considered safe, not all medications are safe for all ages and populations. There is also concern about appropriate weight-based dosing with children.\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[14]\n[16]"
