      "effect": "The use of azathioprine with other immunosuppressive or myelosuppressive agents may result in additive hematologic toxicities and increased risk of infections, particularly in transplant patients. Azathioprine alone may cause dose-related and potentially life-threatening bone marrow suppression, although it is usually reversible when managed promptly. Leucopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and rarely, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, and aplastic anemia have been reported. Dose-related reductions in numbers of circulating total white cells, granulocytes, and lymphocytes may also occur. Treatment with azathioprine alone or in combination with other immunosuppressants, particularly corticosteroids, has been associated with increased susceptibility to infections including severe or atypical infection and reactivation with varicella zoster virus, hepatitis B, cytomegalovirus, and other infectious agents.",
      "management_text": "Concomitant use of azathioprine with other immunosuppressive or myelosuppressive agents should be avoided whenever possible. Close clinical and laboratory monitoring for hematologic toxicity is advised if coadministration is required. Since azathioprine is considered a slow-acting drug, delayed myelosuppression may occur, and effects may persist even after the drug has been discontinued. Prompt reduction in dosage or temporary withdrawal of azathioprine may be necessary if a persistently low or rapid decline in leucocyte count occurs, or if there is other evidence of bone marrow depression.",

Zalcitabine-related peripheral neuropathy is a sensorimotor neuropathy characterized initially by numbness and burning dysesthesia involving the distal extremities. These symptoms may be followed by sharp shooting pains or severe continuous burning pain if the drug is not withdrawn, and progress to severe pain requiring narcotic analgesics. The neuropathy is potentially irreversible. However, with prompt discontinuation of zalcitabine, it is usually slowly reversible, although symptoms may initially progress following discontinuation.",
      "management_text": "Use of zalcitabine with other drugs that have the potential to cause peripheral neuropathy should be avoided whenever possible. Otherwise, careful monitoring is recommended for symptoms of neuropathy such as burning, tingling, pain, numbness, or weakness in the extremities, particularly in patients with a low CD4 cell count or diabetes. Since the development of peripheral neuropathy appears to be dose-related, the recommended dosage of zalcitabine should not be exceeded. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue zalcitabine therapy and contact their physician if neuropathy develops. Therapy may be reinstituted following resolution of neuropathy symptoms, but dosage should be reduced to one-half the initially recommended dosage.
