    "clinical_significance": "In Alzheimer disease, current treatments include cholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil and rivastigmine, and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, such as memantine, which provide symptomatic relief. Anti-amyloid agents aim to reduce amyloid plaque burden and have demonstrated potential in slowing cognitive decline.\n[66]\n[67]\n[68]\n\nFor proteinopathies characterized by misfolding and aggregation, molecular, chemical, or pharmacological chaperones are under investigation to facilitate proper folding, prevent aggregation, or promote degradation of pathogenic proteins. In animal models, these chaperones have exhibited potent neuroprotective effects by modulating early aberrant protein interactions.\n[69]\n\nNo curative therapy currently exists for prion diseases. Management is limited to supportive care and experimental approaches targeting prion propagation.\n[70]\n[71]\n\nIn Parkinson disease, dopamine replacement strategies, including levodopa, dopamine agonists, and monoamine oxidase B inhibitors, constitute the mainstay of symptomatic management.\n[72]\n[73]\nDisease-modifying therapies aimed at preventing α-synuclein aggregation are under development.\n[74]\n[75]\n\nFor Huntington disease, treatment remains primarily symptomatic, with agents such as tetrabenazine employed to control chorea. Gene-silencing approaches are currently under investigation.\n\nEstablished interventions in sickle cell anemia include hydroxyurea to stimulate fetal hemoglobin production, chronic blood transfusions to reduce sickling events, and curative bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.\n[76]\n[77]\nEmerging CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing strategies aim to correct the causative mutation or enhance fetal hemoglobin expression.\n[78]\n[79]\n[80]\n\nContinued, in-depth investigation of protein misfolding mechanisms is critical for elucidating the root causes of these conditions. Such research holds the potential to transform currently incurable disorders into preventable or treatable diseases, fundamentally altering the landscape of modern medicine."
