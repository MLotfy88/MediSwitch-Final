    "indications": "Primary hyperparathyroidism is a relatively common endocrine disorder characterized by increased secretion of parathyroid hormone and hypercalcemia that can result in significant renal and skeletal complications. However, most patients diagnosed in recent decades have relatively mild degrees of hypercalcemia. Although once known for the aphorism as a disease of \"stones, bones, groans, and moans,\" as suggested by Fuller Albright, primary hyperparathyroidism is usually asymptomatic when initially diagnosed.\n[1]\nStones refers to nephrolithiasis caused by hypercalciuria. Groaning refers to abdominal pain from constipation often produced by hypercalcemia or bone pain, which can directly or indirectly result from abnormal remodeling, fractures, or osteoporosis. Neuropsychiatric complaints can also be symptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism. Some degree of depression, anxiety, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, memory loss, and similar psychological symptoms are found in 23% of patients severely affected with hyperparathyroidism.\n[2]\nHistorically, primary hyperparathyroidism was diagnosed when patients presented with recurrent nephrolithiasis or bone disease. Radiological findings of primary hyperparathyroidism include osteitis fibrosa cystica, brown tumors of bones, evidence of subperiosteal bone resorption, \"salt and pepper\" erosions of the skull bones, and tapering of the distal portions of the finger bones and clavicles. While radiological evidence of primary hyperparathyroidism is now rare, bone densitometry can detect skeletal abnormalities well before these more obvious skeletal abnormalities become clinically apparent.\n[3]\n\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism involves excess parathyroid hormone (PTH) production by 1 of the 4 very small parathyroid glands normally located peripherally along the margins on the posterior aspect of the thyroid gland. The average parathyroid gland is approximately 6mm by 4 mm, weighing only 20 to 40 mg. Surgery remains the definitive, curative treatment, but observation alone or medical therapy is appropriate for selected patients.\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\nPTH secretion is a tightly regulated process involving a complex interplay among serum calcium, serum phosphorus, vitamin D, activated vitamin D, and fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23). The primary regulator of PTH release is serum calcium, acting on the calcium-sensing receptors on the parathyroid surface. Calcitriol (ie, activated 1,25-vitamin D) and possibly phosphorus reduce PTH release. A basic understanding of normal calcium homeostasis and the natural history of primary hyperparathyroidism is essential to diagnose and properly manage patients with this disorder.",
    "mechanism": "Parathyroid Gland Physiology\n\nParathyroid glands are made up of 2 cell types:\n\nChief cells: The most common producers of PTH. They have a very prominent Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum.\nOxyphil cells: These cells are larger, but their exact function is unclear. They may have additional endocrine functions or support chief cell activity.\n[8]\n\nSecretion of PTH is inversely related to the ionized calcium concentration in the extracellular fluid as determined by the parathyroid calcium-sensing receptors (CaSR), G-protein coupled molecular chemoreceptors whose activity varies with changes in serum calcium. As the calcium concentration in the extracellular fluid increases, this receptor is activated, and parathyroid chief cells decrease their production and secretion of PTH. Conversely, as serum calcium levels decline, the activity of the CaSR decreases, and PTH secretion increases.\n[9]\n[10]\nPTH activates PTH receptors, increasing the resorption of calcium and phosphate from bone, enhancing the distal tubular calcium reabsorption, and decreasing renal phosphorus reabsorption. The net renal effect is to increase urinary phosphate excretion but decrease urinary calcium until overwhelmed by serum hypercalcemia. PTH also plays an essential role in vitamin D metabolism, activating vitamin D 1-alpha hydroxylase, which increases the renal synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.\n[11]\n\nEtiologies of Hyperparathyroidism\n\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism\n\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism is a disorder characterized by excessive production of PTH. It is the third most common endocrine disorder after diabetes and thyroid disorders. Eighty percent of patients will present with a single adenoma, approximately 15% with hyperplasia of all 4 glands, 2% to 4% with multiple adenomas, and fewer than 1% with parathyroid carcinoma.\n[12]\n[13]\nA combination of increased clonal proliferation of parathyroid tissue with reduced CaSR usually causes primary hyperparathyroidism.\n[10]\nMost of these adenomas will be located in the parathyroid glands, but in up to 10% of cases, they may be in an ectopic location. Potential ectopic locations include the thymus, thyroid, pericardium, retro-esophageal space, or superior mediastinum. More unusual locations to find ectopic parathyroid glands would be in the pharynx, lateral neck, or esophagus.\n[14]\n[15]\n\nParathyroid carcinoma\n\nParathyroid carcinoma is relatively rare, constituting fewer than 1% of all cases of hyperparathyroidism.\n[16]\nCompared to patients with parathyroid adenomas, those with parathyroid carcinomas tend to be younger, more hypercalcemic, and with extremely high levels of PTH. The serum calcium often exceeds 14 mg/dL, with PTH levels 5 to 10 times the upper limit of the reference range. These cancers tend to be relatively aggressive and potentially life-threatening, usually due to severe and intractable hypercalcemia rather than direct invasion by malignant tissue.\n[16]\nWhile rare, the incidence may be increasing in both the US and China.\n[17]\n\nParathyromatosis\n\nParathyromatosis is the presence of multiple small functional nests of parathyroid tissue, usually after surgical removal of the parathyroid glands. This exceedingly rare condition can mimic the appearance of parathyroid carcinoma due to the nests being surrounded by fibrous post-surgical tissue. Parathyromatosis can be distinguished from parathyroid carcinoma by histologic criteria. Parathyromatosis is thought to have 2 etiologies: proliferation of parathyroid tissue residual from embryologic development and, more frequently, seeding during parathyroidectomy or percutaneous ablation, which often occurs in patients with CKD who have persistently elevated PTH.\n[18]\nThis can be a cause of recurrent, persistent, or intractable hyperparathyroidism.\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\nAlthough there are reports of successful treatment with calcimimetics and bisphosphonates, optimal therapy involves complete surgical excision as the removal of all hyperfunctioning nodules is curative, but this is often quite challenging.\n[19]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\nDenosumab, a novel RANK ligand inhibitor, has been used for long-term management. Both medical and surgical treatment are challenging due to the frequent miliary tissue distribution.\n[18]\n\nNormocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism\n\nNormocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism is the presence of persistently elevated PTH levels over at least 6 months despite normal corrected serum calcium and ionized calcium concentrations after excluding all causes of secondary hyperparathyroidism, including calcium and vitamin D deficiencies. Imaging studies to identify hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands are less likely to be positive than those with classical hypercalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism. Evaluation and treatment are similar to primary hyperparathyroidism.\n[5]\n[24]\nMany patients remain asymptomatic and require no treatment except routine and regular monitoring. See the companion StatPearls article, \"Normocalcemic Hyperparathyroidism,\" for further information.\n[24]\n\nLithium\n\nLithium use can cause a degree of CaSR resistance, requiring higher serum calcium levels to suppress PTH secretion. The incidence of this effect is unknown, as PTH levels are not routinely checked in patients on lithium therapy, and cases are often asymptomatic. Lab values will generally show hypercalcemia, non-suppressed PTH, normal serum phosphorus, and hypocalciuria similar to familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia. Lithium-related hyperparathyroidism is considered secondary hyperparathyroidism but can be associated with parathyroid gland hypertrophy requiring surgery and can present similarly to primary hyperparathyroidism.\n[25]\n[26]\n[27]\n\nMalignancy-related hypercalcemia\n\nMalignancy-related hypercalcemia can be found in as many as 20% to 30% of all cancer patients. It can be confused with primary hyperparathyroidism, especially if hypercalcemia symptoms are the first clinical sign of the malignancy. The most common cause of malignancy-related hypercalcemia is the production and secretion of PTH-related protein, most often due to squamous cell carcinoma of the lung and renal cancers.\n[28]\n[29]\nPTH-related protein binds and activates the same receptor as PTH, causing hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and hypophosphatemia. The immunoassay used to quantify PTH-related protein does not detect PTH, and PTH assays do not detect PTH-related protein. Therefore, patients with humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy have high levels of PTH-related protein and low PTH levels, making it easy to differentiate these entities.\n[28]\n[29]\n[30]\nIn the absence of known malignancy, physicians should be suspicious of occult cancer, especially in patients with paraneoplastic-like symptoms such as unexplained fatigue, weight loss, skin rashes, or muscle weakness.\n[30]\nSee the companion StatPearls article \"Malignancy-Related Hypercalcemia\" for further information.\n[28]\n\nGenetic Conditions Associated with Primary Hyperparathyroidism\n\nUp to 10% of primary hyperparathyroidism cases have a genetic basis. Genetic mutations associated with hyperparathyroidism include multiple endocrine neoplasia types 1, 2A, and 4, hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome, familial isolated hyperparathyroidism, neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism, and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia.\n[10]\n[31]\n[32]\n[33]\n[34]\nA familial syndrome should be considered when primary hyperparathyroidism is diagnosed at an early age or there is a family history of hypercalcemia, pituitary adenomas, pancreatic islet cell tumors, pheochromocytomas, or medullary thyroid cancer.\n[35]\nGenetic conditions underlying primary hyperparathyroidism include:\n\nMultiple endocrine neoplasias\n: Multiple endocrine neoplasias (MEN) typically involve multiple glands.\n[36]\nThe first clinical sign of MEN type 1 is usually primary hyperparathyroidism, which commonly appears at an early age, typically 20 to 25 years, and will be seen in over 90% of affected patients. Primary hyperparathyroidism in MEN type 1 individuals usually affects all the parathyroid glands and is typically asymptomatic. Surgery is the recommended treatment if patients are symptomatic or have significant hypercalcemia.\n[6]\nSee the companion StatPearls articles Multiple Endocrine Neoplasias Types 1, 2, and 4.\n[37]\n[38]\n[39]\n\nTumor-jaw syndrome\n: Tumor-jaw syndrome is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder caused by a mutation of the\nCDC73\ngene associated with parathyroid adenomas and carcinomas.\n[6]\nIn addition to hyperparathyroidism, uterine tumors and renal abnormalities, such as Wilms tumor and adenocarcinoma, are associated.\n[40]\n\nFamilial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia\n: Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder that can cause elevated PTH. In this disease, a mutation in the calcium-sensing receptor on the parathyroid gland chief cells causes decreased receptiveness. This leads to mild hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, hypercalciuria, and mildly elevated PTH. This condition is usually asymptomatic and does not require treatment. In this situation, PTH levels will be inappropriately normal in 80% of cases despite hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia and elevated in the remaining 20%.\n[41]\nHistologically, the parathyroid glands appear normal. There is usually a known family history of the disorder, and this condition is more likely if hypercalcemia is detected before age 40.\n[42]\nSee the companion reference StatPearls article on \"Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia\" for further information.\n[42]\n[43]\n\nSevere neonatal hyperparathyroidism\n: This condition is sometimes seen in parents with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia due to heterozygous CaSR mutations. This is a life-threatening disorder manifesting as severe hypercalcemia, respiratory distress, rib cage abnormalities, and hypotonia. Patients may initially respond to medical treatment but usually require parathyroidectomy, sometimes emergently.\n[18]\n\nFamilial isolated hyperparathyroidism\n: This etiology is seen in various gene mutations, including incomplete expression of\nMEN1\n,\nCDC73\n, or\nCASR\nor a germline-activating mutation in\nGCM2\n. Clinical symptoms are variable.\n[18]",
    "monitoring": "All patients with hypercalcemia should be tested for hyperparathyroidism through laboratory studies. The finding of hypercalcemia together with hypophosphatemia is highly suggestive but not diagnostic of hyperparathyroidism. Most patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have normal serum phosphorus, but hypercalcemia with hypophosphatemia is highly suggestive of hyperparathyroidism or humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. The definitive test for primary hyperparathyroidism is the finding of hypercalcemia (ie, ionized calcium or corrected serum calcium) with a simultaneous elevation of PTH. Most causes of hypercalcemia are associated with appropriately low or suppressed PTH levels.\n[44]\nBorderline low vitamin D levels should be treated with supplemental vitamin D to achieve a 25-hydroxyvitamin D value >30 ng/mL to help rule out vitamin D deficiency as a secondary cause of an elevated PTH level.\n[4]\nPatients with primary hyperparathyroidism and other causes of PTH-dependent hypercalcemia often have frankly elevated levels of PTH; others will have values that fall within the reference range but are inappropriately normal. PTH levels should be undetectable or very low in patients with PTH-independent hypercalcemia.\n[44]\nPTH levels typically increase with age. In populations with a high incidence of vitamin D deficiency, the \"normal\" PTH levels tend to be higher.\n[97]\nRecommended serum intact parathyroid tests include immunochemiluminometric or immunoradiometric assays, which readily discriminate between primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy-related hypercalcemia. PTH-related protein, which causes humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, is not detected in the intact PTH assays.\n\nBiotin, also known as vitamin B-7, is a nutritional supplement that can cause a laboratory artifact, interfering with the accurate measurements of several hormones, including PTH.\n[98]\nThe biotin should be discontinued, and the PTH level should be retested in such cases. Patients on drugs such as lithium and thiazide should have these medications stopped for 3 to 6 months, if possible, and their serum calcium and PTH levels retested. If PTH levels remain elevated, this suggests primary hyperparathyroidism.\n\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism can be differentiated from familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia by measuring the 24-hour urine calcium and creatinine. In familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, the 24-hour urine calcium excretion is often lower than 100 mg calcium. The calcium clearance ratio should be calculated using the formula (urinary calcium x serum creatinine)/(serum calcium x urinary creatinine). This ratio is typically l<0.01 in familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia and >0.02 in those with primary hyperparathyroidism. Many patients have values between 0.01 and 0.02, which can be confounded by vitamin D deficiency or chronic kidney disease. Repeat testing after vitamin D repletion may be necessary.\n[99]\nAlthough rarely done, a calcium infusion test can also help distinguish familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia from primary hyperparathyroidism. A calcium load will increase urinary calcium excretion in primary hyperparathyroidism but not familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia. See the companion reference StatPearls review article \"Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia.\"\n[42]\n\nReviewing previous medical records can often be of significant value. Most patients with hyperparathyroidism have persistent or intermittent hypercalcemia for many years before a definitive diagnosis is established. Very few diseases, other than hyperparathyroidism, will allow a healthy-appearing individual to be hypercalcemic for more than a few years without any clinical signs or symptoms. The need for different studies such as PTH-related protein levels, serum or urine protein electrophoresis, 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D levels, thyroid tests, or mammography can be individualized and are usually only needed in those with PTH-independent hypercalcemia. The following diagnostic studies are used to evaluate patients for primary hyperparathyroidism:\n\nIntact PTH\nPhosphorus\nTotal and ionized calcium\nTwenty-four-hour urine calcium and creatinine, with creatinine clearance\nVitamin D level (ie, 25-hydroxyvitamin D)\nAlbumin and corrected calcium level\nAlkaline phosphatase\nBone densitometry (DEXA), including measurement at the distal one-third radius, which is preferentially affected in patients with hyperparathyroidism\nBUN and creatinine\nGenetic testing for suspicion of a genetic syndrome\n[100]\nImaging studies (eg, nuclear medicine and ultrasonography) for surgical candidates\nImaging to screen for renal calcifications or urolithiasis\nKidney, ureters, bladder (KUB) x-ray or renal ultrasound\nNoncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan\nMarkers of bone formation and resorption (not routinely recommended)\n\nParathyroid Localization Imaging Studies\n\nNeck ultrasonography and parathyroid nuclear medicine (Tc-sestamibi) scans are standard imaging tests for the localization of hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands. However, these tests are not considered definitive because there can be false-negative results, and they are generally less useful in multiglandular parathyroid disease.\n[101]\nThey should not be ordered unless there are plans for surgery, as they are most useful to assist the surgeon as a \"roadmap\" in localizing enlarged, hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands, particularly when an ectopic gland is suspected. Neck ultrasonography is highly operator-dependent but accurate in centers with experience and expertise.\n[102]\nThese are considered more sensitive than sestamibi scans, which often cannot detect nodules smaller than 500mg.\n[103]\n[104]\nThe sensitivity of parathyroid imaging scans can be enhanced when combined with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).\n[105]\n\nParathyroid 4-dimensional multiphase (4D) CT should be considered when surgery is planned, and the abnormal parathyroid glands cannot be localized with sestamibi scans or neck ultrasound, or these two imaging modalities have discordant results.\n[105]\n[106]\nThere is evidence that 4D CT is superior to sestamibi SPECT/CT.\n[107]\nThis 4D modality is an emerging method of localization of parathyroid adenomas for presurgical planning, although implementation, instrumentation, and correct interpretation are still somewhat challenging.\n[106]\n[108]\nF-18-Fluorocholine positron emission tomography/CT has shown promising results in parathyroid adenoma localization in difficult or equivocal cases, suggesting superiority over sestamibi scanning, ultrasound, or CT scans alone.\n[109]\n\nInfrared thermal scanning is another promising imaging technique for localizing parathyroid hyperactivity. This is potentially most useful where other imaging modalities are conflicting or inadequate. It is based on hyperfunctioning parathyroid lesions being hypervascular and averaging about 2 degrees warmer than normal tissue, allowing them to be picked up by thermal imaging. Such thermal scanning has successfully identified parathyroid adenomas not easily visualized by other techniques.\n[110]\nWhen noninvasive preoperative localization studies are negative, selective parathyroid venous sampling, although technically challenging, can help identify the anatomical location of abnormal hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands.\n[111]\n[112]\n\nBone Imaging\n\nBone biopsies are rarely indicated in evaluating patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, so DEXA and other techniques assess the quantity and quality of bone. Newer noninvasive imaging technologies suggest that the effects of PTH excess on skeletal tissue may be more significant than previously thought. The trabecular bone score is an indirect analysis of trabecular microstructure extracted from data obtained from the DEXA. Trabecular bone score demonstrates decreased connectivity of the trabecular spinal microstructure in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, although the T-score on the DEXA may not be significantly reduced.\n[113]\nHigh-resolution peripheral quantitative CT scans of the distal radius and tibia show fewer, thinner, and more widely spaced trabeculae in primary hyperparathyroidism.\n[114]\n[115]\n[116]\nTrabecular microstructural defects may account for the relatively high number of vertebral fractures in primary hyperparathyroidism despite apparently preserved bone mineral density in the lumbar spine.\n[117]\n[118]\n[119]\nThese fractures may sometimes be asymptomatic.\n[120]",
    "administration": "In 2022, a panel of experts in parathyroid disorders published updated guidelines for managing primary hyperparathyroidism. The task force included endocrinologists, nephrologists, pathologists, epidemiologists, radiologists, pharmacologists, and endocrine surgeons.\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[10]\n[74]\n[121]\n\nManagement Approach\n\nSurgery remains the definitive treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism. Nonoperative surveillance may be an appropriate option for some, particularly for patients who are elderly with mild hypercalcemia and no significant complications. Medical treatment with bisphosphonates or cinacalcet can be extremely useful in selected patients. The decision of whether to recommend surgery is based on age, the degree of hypercalcemia, and the presence or absence of complications of hyperparathyroidism, as well as patient comorbidities and surgical/anesthesia risk.\n\nPatients who are not surgical candidates may benefit from medical management of primary hyperparathyroidism. Calcium intake should not be restricted as this could further stimulate PTH production; calcium is often supplemented in the setting of bone disease.\n[5]\nThere is substantial evidence that chronic vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for hyperparathyroidism.\n[122]\n[123]\nExperts recommend that patients with hyperparathyroidism who are deficient in vitamin D levels receive supplements to achieve a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level higher than 30 ng/mL.\n[4]\n[5]\n[124]\nLong-term outcomes in patients with hyperparathyroidism who do not undergo surgery are reported for patients followed for as long as 15 years.\n[125]\nThey generally show relatively stable chemistries. There is a decrease in bone mineral density starting at 8 to 9 years during nonoperative surveillance that becomes more significant after year 10.\n[44]\n[125]\nA few patients lost >10% of their measured bone mineral density after 15 years. Renal function remains stable, but hypercalciuria persists, so there is an increased risk of nephrolithiasis.\n[125]\nCurrent guidelines for monitoring patients with primary hyperparathyroidism being treated medically recommend the following:\n\nAnnual measurement of serum calcium, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and creatinine clearance\nPTH levels can be repeated as clinically indicated\nRepeat 24-hour urine calcium excretion, abdominal imaging for calcifications, and vertebral X-rays can be repeated if clinically indicated\nThree-site DEXA scans are recommended either annually or biannually\n[4]\n[5]\n\nMedical Management\n\nMedical therapy in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism is designed to treat osteoporosis or hypercalcemia. Cinacalcet can reduce serum calcium but will generally not increase bone mineral density, while antiresorptive agents can improve bone density but are not as effective in lowering serum calcium. If both problems require treatment, combination therapy is recommended.\n[5]\n[121]\n[126]\n[127]\nThe following agents may be used in medical management of primary hyperparathyroidism:\n\nOral bisphosphonates and denosumab are antiresorptive agents and can increase bone mineral density in hyperparathyroid patients with osteoporosis or osteopenia.\n[44]\n[121]\n[128]\n[129]\nThere are reports of denosumab controlling refractory hypercalcemia, and intravenous bisphosphonates have successfully treated severe hypercalcemia but are not a feasible long-term therapy.\n[130]\n[131]\n[132]\n[133]\n\nMedications that activate the calcium-sensing receptor, such as cinacalcet, will significantly lower serum PTH and calcium in hyperparathyroid patients but generally not increase their bone density.\n[134]\n[135]\nOver 70% will normalize their blood calcium levels on these medications.\n[134]\n[135]\n[136]\n[137]\nPTH levels typically drop by 35% to 50% but may not reach normal levels even after the serum calcium is within normal limits.\n[138]\n[139]\nCinacalcet is quite effective in patients with otherwise intractable hyperparathyroidism and can normalize serum calcium even in cases of inoperable parathyroid carcinoma.\n[138]\n[140]\nVitamin D and urinary calcium levels do not change significantly. Cinacalcet is also used for treating secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease.\n[141]\n\nEstrogen therapy for postmenopausal women with primary hyperparathyroidism has shown a benefit in increasing bone mineral density, particularly in the lumbar spine, but does not change serum PTH or calcium.\n[142]\n[143]\n[144]\nGiven concerns over long-term, chronic use, estrogen is not routinely recommended for medical management of primary hyperparathyroidism.\n[142]\n\nOral phosphates can reduce serum calcium levels up to 1 mg/dL. They reduce intestinal calcium absorption by calcium binding, lower vitamin D levels, and reduce bone resorption.\n[145]\n[146]\nSince phosphates can increase PTH levels and the risk of soft tissue calcification, they are no longer routinely used in the long-term medical management of primary hyperparathyroidism.\n\nSurgical Therapy\n\nSurgery is the treatment of choice for those with symptomatic disease, including those with recurrent kidney stones or overt bone disease.\n[4]\n[147]\n[148]\nSuccessful parathyroidectomy results in permanent normalization of serum calcium decreased PTH levels, and a dramatic improvement in bone mineral density at all sites. Following successful parathyroid surgery, bone mineral density, microstructure, and strength improve while patients also experience a reduced risk of fractures and kidney stones.\n[114]\n[149]\n[150]\n[151]\n[152]\n[153]\nRubin et al reported an improvement in bone mineral density of approximately 10% at all sites after successful parathyroidectomy, a benefit extended for at least 15 years.\n[125]\n[154]\nThese benefits were seen in all parathyroidectomy patients regardless of whether they met the surgery criteria. However, there is conflicting data on whether neurocognitive function or cardiovascular events improve after successful parathyroid surgery.\n[114]\n[155]\n[156]\n[157]\nWhile there are reports that hyperparathyroid patients with cognitive impairment could see improvement in their mental functioning as early as 2 weeks following parathyroid surgery, the 5th International Workshop task force concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend parathyroidectomy to improve quality of life, neurocognitive function, or cardiovascular indices.\n[4]\n[158]\n\nSurgery is an option for all patients with primary hyperparathyroidism if the patient and physician agree and there are no contraindications. Surgery should optimally be done by experienced parathyroid surgeons who perform these surgeries frequently and are knowledgeable about preoperative localization. Success rates exceed 95% in such hands.\n[6]\n[159]\n[160]\nCurrent guidelines recommend surgery as the gold standard treatment for all patients with symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism.\n[4]\nIndications for surgery for patients with asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism include:\n[4]\n\nAge younger than 50 years\nGFR or creatinine clearance is <60 mL/min\nEvidence of renal calcifications, nephrocalcinosis, or urinary stones\nHypercalciuria (>300 mg/24 hours in men or 250 mg 24 hours in women)\nOsteoporosis on DEXA scan (T-score <-2.5 at any site)\nSerum calcium >1 mg/dL above the upper limit of normal\nVertebral compression fracture on imaging\n\nPreoperative localization studies are recommended in patients undergoing surgery, especially if a minimally invasive technique is utilized. Imaging studies are not recommended for diagnosis alone due to poor sensitivity and specificity, with a false-positive rate as high as 25%.\n[104]\nMinimally invasive parathyroidectomy is now the preferred surgery for hyperparathyroidism in most centers. This surgery is directed specifically to the location of the previously identified abnormal parathyroid gland.\n[161]\nAdditionally, the use of intraoperative PTH measurements is recommended to verify the efficacy of the surgery. The half-life of PTH is only 3 to 4 minutes, so the PTH level should drop by at least 50% from the preoperative level in 10 to 20 minutes after successful excision and should normalize within 30 minutes.\n[162]\n[163]\n[164]\n[165]\nAbout 2% of abnormal parathyroid tissue sources (an adenoma in 88% of cases or hyperplastic tissue in 12%) are found in the thyroid gland. Ultrasonography and sestamibi scanning are usually successful in finding and localizing the abnormally functioning tissue. Surgical cures are generally possible with either local excision or thyroid lobectomy.\n[166]\nRadiofrequency ablation of isolated parathyroid adenomas has been successfully reported with minimal complications in small series.\n[167]\n[168]\nThis may be an acceptable alternative for patients who would not otherwise be surgical candidates.\n\nLeft untreated, many patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have progressive loss of cortical bone. However, successful surgery leads to a substantial increase in bone mineral density, an effect that can persist for up to 15 years.\n[125]\n[155]\nPatients with nephrolithiasis who undergo surgery tend to have fewer stones. However, other chemical promoters of kidney stones are still possible, so a 24-hour urine kidney stone risk profile analysis is recommended.\n[148]\nDuring the period of nonoperative surveillance, surgery is recommended if patients develop symptoms, complications, worsening hypercalcemia, or any of the following occur:\n[4]\n\nLow trauma fracture\nNephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis\nSerum calcium consistently >1 mg/dL above the upper limit of normal\nSignificant reduction in BMD to a T-score <2.5 at any site\nSignificant decrease in creatinine clearance\n\nHungry Bone Syndrome\n\nImmediately following the surgical correction of primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism, a period of profound, severe, and prolonged hypocalcemia may ensue, which is called hungry bone syndrome. While there is no definitive consensus, most sources will define hungry bone syndrome as persistent low serum calcium of lower than 8.4 mg/dL for longer than 4 days after definitive parathyroid surgery.\n[169]\n[170]\nThe sudden drop in PTH levels immediately after surgery results in unopposed accelerated osteoblastic activity as serum calcium quickly becomes incorporated into new bone, causing significant hypocalcemia.\n[169]\n[170]\nThis is often accompanied by hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, and elevated alkaline phosphatase.\n[170]\n\nHypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia can persist for months or even years.\n[170]\nOther causes of hypocalcemia after parathyroid surgery include hypoparathyroidism and hypomagnesemia. As opposed to the hungry bone syndrome, the serum phosphorus should be high in those with hypoparathyroidism. The likelihood of hungry bone syndrome increases with the duration and severity of hyperparathyroidism.\n[169]\nThis syndrome may also occur after correction of secondary hyperparathyroidism, thyrotoxicosis, vitamin D supplementation in calcitriol deficient patients, or treatment of malignant tumors, including prostate cancer, that affect calcium metabolism.\n[171]\nIt is now more common to see hungry bone syndrome in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism from renal failure and chronic dialysis than from primary parathyroid disease.\n[170]\n\nTreatment generally includes high oral doses of supplemental calcium, with calcium citrate being preferred, and vitamin D. However, if the serum calcium is <7.6 mg/dL, there are symptoms from hypocalcemia, or there are related EKG changes (eg, prolonged QT), intravenous calcium supplementation is indicated. Calcium gluconate is usually preferred over calcium chloride for IV calcium supplementation due to easier administration, as a central line is unnecessary, and there is less chance of tissue necrosis if the IV infiltrates.\n[169]\n[170]\n[172]\nSee the companion StatPearls article \"Hungry Bone Syndrome\" for further information.\n[169]",
