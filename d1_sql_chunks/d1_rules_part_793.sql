Since the development of peripheral neuropathy may be dose-related for many drugs, the recommended dosages should generally not be exceeded.  Consideration should be given to dosage reduction or immediate discontinuation of these medications in patients who develop peripheral neuropathy to limit further damage.  If feasible, therapy should generally be reinstituted only after resolution of neuropathy symptoms or return of symptoms to baseline status.  In some cases, permanent dosage reductions may be required.', 'Synergism', 'Caution is advised during concomitant use of agents with neurotoxic effects.', NULL, NULL, 'Moderate', 'pharmacodynamic');
