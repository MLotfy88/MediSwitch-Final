Females with AAS abuse may have severe acne, menstrual irregularities, hirsutism, and clitoromegaly.\n[16]\nAll groups can experience high blood pressure, changes in cholesterol, liver diseases such as cysts, heart diseases such as coronary artery disease, kidney diseases, and the risk of infections due to unsterile injections.\n[11]\nIn observational studies on males who used anabolic steroids, there was also higher coronary plaque formation volume when compared to non-users. Moreover, approximately 71% of the anabolic steroid users had impaired ability to pump blood efficiently, leading to lower-than-normal left ventricle ejection fraction.\n[27]\n[28]"
