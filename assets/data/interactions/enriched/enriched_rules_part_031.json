Symptoms of hypoglycemia such as tremor and tachycardia may be absent, making it more difficult for patients to recognize an oncoming episode. Specifically, inhibition of catecholamine-mediated glycogenolysis and glucose mobilization in association with beta-blockade can potentiate insulin-induced hypoglycemia in diabetics and delay the recovery of normal blood glucose levels. Prolonged and severe hypoglycemia may occur, although these events have rarely been reported. Significant increases in blood pressure and bradycardia can also occur during hypoglycemia in diabetics treated with insulin and beta-blockers due to antagonism of epinephrine's effect on beta-2 adrenergic receptors, which leads to unopposed alpha-adrenergic effects including vasoconstriction. Other effects reported with various beta-blockers include decreased glucose tolerance and decreased glucose-induced insulin secretion.",

Patients should be advised of the need for regular blood glucose monitoring and be aware that certain symptoms of hypoglycemia such as tremor and tachycardia may be masked.

Prolonged and severe hypoglycemia may occur, although these events have rarely been reported. Significant increases in blood pressure and bradycardia can also occur during hypoglycemia in diabetics treated with insulin and beta-blockers due to antagonism of epinephrine's effect on beta-2 adrenergic receptors, which leads to unopposed alpha-adrenergic effects including vasoconstriction.

Serum electrolytes, including potassium, magnesium and calcium, should be measured at baseline and periodically during treatment, and any abnormalities corrected prior to initiating clozapine.

If coadministration is necessary, patients should be alerted to the possibility of excessive drowsiness and monitored for potentially diminished therapeutic response to both treatments. Patients treated for Parkinson's disease should generally avoid antidopaminergic agents, particularly phenothiazines and older neuroleptic agents, since these agents may cause extrapyramidal reactions and exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Likewise, patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with dopaminergic drugs because of the risk of exacerbating the psychosis with an increase in central dopaminergic tone.",

Ginkgo products may contain varying amounts of 4'-O-methylpyridoxine (ginkgotoxin), a known neurotoxin found primarily in ginkgo biloba seeds but also detected in lesser amounts in the leaves. In vivo, 4'-O-methylpyridoxine competes with vitamin B6, which causes an indirect inhibition of glutamate decarboxylase and subsequent decrease in the formation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain. There have been published case reports of generalized convulsions and vomiting within several hours after ingestion of large amounts of ginkgo nuts/seeds, including in young children and healthy individuals with no known personal or family history of epilepsy.",
