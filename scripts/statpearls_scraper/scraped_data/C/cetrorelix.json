    "indications": "Before initiation of ART modalities, the maternal risks associated with ART procedures and pregnancy are discussed with the patient. An active pelvic infection is a contraindication for invasive ART procedures, such as transvaginal oocyte retrieval. Certain maternal conditions, particularly cardiopulmonary conditions such as pulmonary hypertension and heart failure, are relative contraindications for pregnancy itself. Preconception counseling and an evaluation to screen for such conditions should be conducted. Gestational carrier options can be utilized in patients with such contraindications.\n[5]",
    "clinical_significance": "ART enables individuals and couples to achieve pregnancy in circumstances where natural conception may be unlikely or impossible, including cases of infertility, prior exposure to gonadotoxic treatments, and the presence of heritable genetic disorders.\n\nAccording to the CDC, as of 2017, 1.9% of US-born infants were conceived with ART. In 2017, approximately 200,000 ART cycles with embryo transfer were performed, resulting in 78,052 live births.\n[46]\nAs rates of delayed childbearing and insurance coverage for ART increase, these numbers are likely to rise. As such, women’s health and reproductive healthcare providers need to have a working knowledge of indications for ART and appropriate timing for referral to a reproductive endocrinology and infertility (REI) specialist."
