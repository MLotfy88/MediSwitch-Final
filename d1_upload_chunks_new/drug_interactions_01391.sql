Other mechanisms may also be involved in bronchoconstriction that are unrelated to beta-2 blockade--for example, their effects on cholinergic M2 receptors and alpha-1 adrenoreceptors.', 'DDInter', 'Beta-blockers, including those with relative cardioselectivity, should generally be avoided in patients with bronchospastic diseases. However, given their demonstrated benefit in such conditions as heart failure, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension, cardioselective beta-blockers may be administered with caution to those who do not respond to or tolerate alternative treatment. The benefits generally outweigh the risks in patients with mild or moderate reactive airway disease that is well controlled on inhaled corticosteroids and beta-2 agonists, provided they have no prior history suggesting a predisposition to severe exacerbations.', 'Others', 'Beta-blockers, including those with relative cardioselectivity, should generally be avoided in patients with bronchospastic diseases.', 'Moderate', 'pharmacodynamic', NULL, 'https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/139361/', '', 'Felodipine, Acetylsalicylic acid, Amlodipine, Nifedipine, Carteolol', '', 1767369485);
