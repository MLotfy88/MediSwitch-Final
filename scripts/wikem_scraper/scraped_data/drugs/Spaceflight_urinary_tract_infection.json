      "text": "Over the years, several astronauts aboard the Space Shuttle, International Space Station (ISS), and other spacecraft have been diagnosed with UTIs, resulting in a range of outcomes.\n[1]\nFred  Haise, the lunar module pilot of Apollo 13, developed a urinary tract infection during his mission that progressed to pyelonephritis, with lethargy, fevers, and flank  pain persisting throughout the duration of the mission.\n[2]\nIn   1985,   Russian cosmonaut  Vladimir  Vasyutin underwent a pre-mature  de-orbit from the space station Salyut 7 due to a case of prostatitis.\n[3]\nUrinary retention, a common issue during spaceflight, is a significant risk factor for developing UTIs. Astronaunts with urinary retention are 25 times more likely to have a UTI with a 17% infection rate per mission.\n[4]\nMaintaining aseptic technique during catheterization for urinary retention management is an additional risk factor for developing UTIs during spaceflight, on top of the risk posed by urinary retention itself.\n[5]\nSimulations suggest that UTIs in female astronauts predisposes them to a greater likelihood of medical evacuation compared to men during 6-month and 2.5-year missions.\n[6]",
