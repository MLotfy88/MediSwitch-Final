In general, the risk of an individual agent or a combination of agents causing ventricular arrhythmia in association with QT prolongation is largely unpredictable but may be increased by certain underlying risk factors such as congenital long QT syndrome, cardiac disease, and electrolyte disturbances (e.g., hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia). In addition, the extent of drug-induced QT prolongation is dependent on the particular drug(s) involved and dosage(s) of the drug(s). Coadministration with potent CYP450 3A4 inhibitors may increase the plasma concentrations and the risk of adverse effects of ribociclib, which is primarily metabolized by the isoenzyme.', NULL, 'Coadministration of ribociclib with other drugs that can prolong the QT interval and are CYP450 3A4 inhibitors should generally be avoided.', NULL, 'Coadministration of ribociclib with other drugs that can prolong the QT interval and are CYP450 3A4 inhibitors should generally be avoided. Since the magnitude of QT prolongation may increase with increasing plasma concentrations of ribociclib, caution and close clinical monitoring are recommended if concomitant use with these drugs is unavoidable. Alternative agents with no or minimal CYP450 3A4 inhibitory potential are recommended whenever possible. If no alternatives exist, the dose of ribociclib should be reduced to 400 mg once daily. Following discontinuation of the potent CYP450 3A4 inhibitor, the ribociclib dosage should be returned (after at least 5 half-lives of the inhibitor) to that used prior to initiation of the inhibitor. In addition, ECGs should be assessed prior to initiation of treatment, during treatment when clinically necessary, and more frequently if QTcF prolongation occurs at any time during treatment. Ribociclib should be permanently discontinued if the QTcF interval prolongation is either greater than 500 msec or there is a greater than 60 msec change from baseline and associated with any of the following: Torsades de Pointes, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, unexplained syncope, or signs/symptoms of serious arrhythmia.', 'Metabolism, Synergism', NULL, NULL, 'Major', NULL, 'DDInter', 'pharmacodynamic', 1767317475);
