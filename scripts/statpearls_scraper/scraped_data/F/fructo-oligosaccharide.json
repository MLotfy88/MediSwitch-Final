    "clinical_significance": "Dietary Recommendations To Prevent Dental Caries\n\nWhen a population consumes less than 15 to 20 kg/person/year of free sugars, the levels of dental caries remain low.\n[9]\nThis is the maximum safe level of free sugar intake for caries prevention.\n[9]\nThe frequency of sugar intake per day should be limited to four times or less daily as higher frequency usually exceeds 15 kg/year and is linked to higher levels of caries.\n[9]\n\nFood that stimulates saliva secretion has a protective effect against caries, e.g., hard cheeses, peanuts, wholegrain foods, and sugar-free chewing gum.\n[9]\n\nA diet rich in fresh vegetables, fruits, and wholegrain starches and low in added sugars and fat prevents chronic diseases associated with diet, including oral conditions like dental caries, periodontal infections, and oral malignancy.\n[9]\n\nThe Prenatal Stage\n\nMothers and caregivers influence their children's diet and oral hygiene. Pregnant women have a unique opportunity to receive appropriate information about healthy dietary habits and general oral hygiene to prevent early childhood caries in their children. Furthermore, maintaining good oral hygiene must be emphasized, as mothers and caregivers are the sources of cariogenic bacteria in their children.\n[12]\nMothers should also be advised to limit sugar consumption and snacking on sugary products between meals.\n[12]\n\nPoor nutrition in pregnant women may result in developmental anomalies in the infants' teeth.\n[12]\nEnamel hypoplasia has been associated with poor prenatal nutrition and increased caries risk. Infants with enamel hypoplasia are at a 2.5 times higher risk of developing dental caries than children with sound enamel.\n[12]\nTherefore, expecting mothers should be informed of the importance of following the healthy eating pyramid recommendations and their physician's advice regarding vitamin and mineral supplements.\n[12]\n\nDietary recommendations for pregnant women to prevent dental caries in their children include the following:\n\nFollowing the healthy eating pyramid.\nReduce the consumption of cariogenic food, particularly between meals.\nTaking prenatal supplements containing vitamins and minerals as prescribed by their general physician.\n[12]\n\nFrom Birth to the First Year of Age\n\nThe first few years after birth are critical since there is a massive dietary shift from exclusive milk and liquid diet to a modified adult diet. Breastfeeding is strongly recommended in the first year of life because of its nutritional and immunological benefits. Breast milk is insignificant in the development of early childhood caries as compared to night-time bottle feeding, which should be discouraged. Breast milk is low in fluoride.\n[13]\nSystemic fluoride supplementation can be indicated for infants more than six months of age if the fluoride levels are insufficient in the area where they live.\n[12]\nHowever, clinicians must corroborate that the fluoride levels are low in the local drinking water before supplementing a child because of the risk of dental fluorosis.\n[12]\n\nParenting plays an important role in the transition from milk to solid foods. Parents influence what the child likes or dislikes, the quality of diet, and overall weight status.\n[14]\nDietary recommendations to prevent dental caries for children at this age include the following:\n\nEnsuring optimal nutrition.\nDecreasing the consumption of drinks other than breast milk, formula, and water.\nAvoiding putting the child to bed with a bottle.\nProhibiting dipping pacifiers in foods with high concentrations of sugars, like honey or syrup.\nDissuading constant sipping of drinks from a bottle.\n[12]\n\nFirst and Second Year of Age\n\nEstablishing a healthy eating pattern at a young age benefits oral and general health. Parents should make careful choices regarding types of snacks; low-cariogenic food such as fruits and cheese must be encouraged.\n[12]\nChildren may reject new food initially, but parents should persist in offering them and making them available.\n[12]\nDietary recommendations to prevent dental caries in this age group include the following:\n[12]\n\nContinuing to discourage constant drinking from a bottle and putting the child to bed with a bottle.\nEstablishing a routine eating pattern.\nOffering non-cariogenic snacks, like cheese.\nLimiting the consumption of cariogenic food to mealtimes.\nRestricting the consumption of sugary drinks to 120 ml (4 oz) per day.\n\nFrom Two to Five Years of Age\n\nChildren would prefer foods high in sugar and calories if exposed to repeated consumption of such foods early in infancy.\n[12]\nParents must make sure that regular eating patterns are already inculcated by this age and continue to encourage them.\n\nDuring this period, children begin to be more independent, make their own food choices, and increase food snacking between meals.\n[12]\nNon-cariogenic or low-cariogenic snacks must be available at home and provided in school lunchboxes, e.g., cheese, plain milk, vegetables, fruits, and whole grain products.\n[12]\nSugary snacks that tend to be retained in the mouth for extended periods should be discouraged, like candies and lollipops.\n[12]\n\nDietary recommendations to prevent dental caries at this age include:\n\nContinuing to promote regular eating patterns.\nPromoting eating cariogenic foods only with meals.\nOffering non-cariogenic or low-cariogenic snacks, like cheese and fruits.\nAvoiding sugar-containing foods that are sticky or slowly eaten.\n[12]"
