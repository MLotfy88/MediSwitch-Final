The proposed mechanism is inhibition of CYP450 3A4-mediated first-pass metabolism in the gut wall by certain compounds present in grapefruit.  Because grapefruit juice inhibits primarily intestinal rather than hepatic CYP450 3A4, the magnitude of interaction is greatest for those drugs that undergo significant presystemic metabolism by CYP450 3A4 (i.e., drugs with low oral bioavailability).  In general, the effect of grapefruit juice is concentration-, dose- and preparation-dependent, and can vary widely among brands.  Certain preparations of grapefruit juice (e.g., high dose, double strength) have sometimes demonstrated potent inhibition of CYP450 3A4, while other preparations (e.g., low dose, single strength) have typically demonstrated moderate inhibition.','grapefruit juice','Moderate','Patients who regularly consume grapefruit or grapefruit juice should be monitored for adverse effects and altered plasma concentrations of drugs that undergo significant presystemic metabolism by CYP450 3A4.

In addition, variations in plasma zidovudine concentrations were increased when administered in the fed state.  In another study of eight patients, the time to reach peak concentration (Tmax) was increased from 0.68 to 1.95 hours, and Cmax was reduced by 50% when zidovudine was administered with a liquid high-fat meal relative to fasting.  Protein meals can also delay the absorption and reduce the Cmax of zidovudine, although the extent of absorption is not significantly affected.
