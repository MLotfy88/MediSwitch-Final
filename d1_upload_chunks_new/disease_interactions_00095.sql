The risk appears to be greatest with grepafloxacin and sparfloxacin (both are no longer marketed in the U.S.), although cardiovascular morbidity and mortality attributable to QT prolongation have also been reported rarely with others like gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin.  Reported cases have primarily occurred in patients with advanced age, cardiac disease, electrolyte disturbances, and/or underlying medical problems for which they were receiving concomitant medications known to prolong the QT interval.
