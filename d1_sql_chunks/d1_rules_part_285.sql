Antihypertensive agents such as diuretics may potentiate the orthostatic effect that is occasionally observed upon the initiation of SSRI or SNRI therapy. Syncope and orthostatic hypotension tend to occur within the first week of SNRI/SSRI therapy but can occur at any time during treatment, particularly after a dosage increase. The use of SSRIs or SNRIs may also cause sustained increases in blood pressure and heart rate, which may antagonize the therapeutic effects of antihypertensive medications.', NULL, 'Caution is recommended if SSRIs or SNRIs are prescribed in combination with diuretics, particularly in the elderly.', NULL, 'Caution is recommended if SSRIs or SNRIs are prescribed in combination with diuretics, particularly in the elderly.

More severe and/or acute cases may include hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. Discontinuation of SSRI/SNRI therapy should be considered in patients who develop symptomatic hyponatremia, and appropriate medical intervention instituted as necessary. Patients should also have their blood pressure and pulse monitored before and during SSRI/SNRI therapy, especially during the first few weeks and following a dosage increase.

Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can decrease serum bicarbonate in a dose-related manner and induce non-anion gap, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. In addition, they can promote stone formation by reducing urinary citrate excretion and increasing urinary pH.

If left untreated, metabolic acidosis can also lead to nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis, osteomalacia (or rickets in children), osteoporosis, and reduced growth rates in pediatric patients. Increased fluid intake is recommended during therapy with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors to increase urinary output, which lowers the concentration of substances involved in stone formation.
