Although hypoglycemia rarely occurs during treatment with metformin alone, the risk may increase with acute consumption of alcohol.

Diabetes patients in general should avoid consuming alcohol if their blood glucose is not well controlled, or if they have hypertriglyceridemia, neuropathy, or pancreatitis.  Alcohol should not be consumed on an empty stomach or following exercise, as it may increase the risk of hypoglycemia.  Patients should contact their physician immediately if they experience potential signs and symptoms of lactic acidosis such as malaise, myalgia, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress (especially after stabilization of metformin therapy, when gastrointestinal symptoms are uncommon).  With more marked acidosis, there may also be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias.  Metformin should be withdrawn promptly if lactic acidosis is suspected.  Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, blood pH, lactate levels, and blood metformin levels may be useful in establishing a diagnosis.
