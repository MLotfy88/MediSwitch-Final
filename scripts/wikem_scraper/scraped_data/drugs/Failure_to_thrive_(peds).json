Over 80% of cases are due to insufficient caloric intake from exogenous causes.\nHistory should focus on breastfeeding technique, frequency, and duration, or amount of formula and method of preparation.\nObserved feeds can often be useful to identify problems.\nIf an endogenous cause is suspected, specific lab tests or imaging studies may be helpful to evaluate for metabolic abnormalities, the presence of infections, malignancy, or anatomic malformations. Additional testing should be ordered on a case by case basis and is only recommended if a specific etiology is suspected.",
