    "indications": "Hypersensitivity to phenytoin or other hydantoins is a contraindication for using phenytoin. Pregnancy is another absolute contraindication for phenytoin use.\n\nHanson\net al.\nreported a prevalence of fetal hydantoin syndrome (FHS) of 11% in pregnant women receiving treatment for epilepsy with phenytoin, with an additional 30% of the\nin utero\n-exposed children expressing some of the syndrome’s features such as epicanthic folds, hypertelorism, broad flat nasal bridges, an upturned nasal tip, wide prominent lips and, also, distal digital hypoplasia, intrauterine growth retardation, and diminished mental capacity.\n[10]",
    "mechanism": "Phenytoin is a hydantoin derivative, a first-generation anti-convulsant drug that is effective in the treatment of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, complex partial seizures, and status epilepticus without significantly impairing neurological function.\n\nPhenytoin works by blockade of voltage-dependent membrane sodium channels responsible for increasing the action potential. This action obstructs the positive feedback that sustains high-frequency repetitive firing, thus preventing the spread of the seizure focal point.\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]",
    "administration": "Phenytoin is available in oral and parenteral formulations. Intramuscular administration is not recommended due to its erratic absorption and local reaction. The drug is slowly administered intravenously directly into a large central or peripheral vein through an IV catheter less than 20 gauge, not exceeding a rate of 50 mg/minute. It requires dilution with sodium chloride. Crystals will form when diluted with a dextrose solution.\n\nDue to its poor solubility, parenteral phenytoin is available in a solution of propylene glycol and alcohol, which are responsible for some of the adverse effects of its intravenous administration. Fosphenytoin underwent development as a water-soluble prodrug of phenytoin, devoid of these compounds, which is only available in an injection formulation and may be administered intravenously or intramuscularly.\n[1]\n[5]",
    "adverse_effects": "Adverse effects potentially include the following:\n\nRash\nSedation\nPeripheral neuropathy\n[6]\nPhenytoin encephalopathy\n[7]\nPsychosis\nLocomotor dysfunction\nHyperkinesia\nMegaloblastic anemia\nDecreased bone mineral content\nStevens-Johnson syndrome\nToxic epidermal necrolysis\nImmunoglobulin A deficiency\nGingival hyperplasia\nDress syndrome (drug reaction accompanied by eosinophilia and systemic symptoms)\nCardiovascular collapse\nHypotension\nArrhythmias\nHydantoin syndrome in newborns\nPurple glove syndrome\n[8]\nHypertrichosis\n[9]",
    "monitoring": "Pharmacokinetics\n\nIn therapeutic doses, phenytoin is absorbed entirely and reaches peak plasma concertation at 1.5 to 3 hours. However, in settings of acute ingestions, absorption tends to last longer than two weeks; this is potentially attributable to its effects on reducing gastrointestinal motility and poor water solubility.\n\nFosphenytoin can be administered intramuscularly (IM) or intravenously (IV) but requires enzymatic conversion by phosphatase in the body to the active phenytoin compound.\n\nDistribution\n\nPhenytoin is usually 90% bound to plasma proteins (mostly albumin), and only its unbound form is pharmacologically active. The fraction of protein binding may be lower in neonates, pregnant patients, hypoalbuminemia, and uremia. It is distributed in all tissues and becomes firmly tissue-bound with a large volume of distribution.\n\nIts levels are higher in the central nervous system as compared to the serum.\n\nMetabolism\n\nThe hepatic P450 enzyme system metabolizes phenytoin (predominantly CYP2C9 and CYP 2C19) to inactive metabolites and is an inducer of CYP3A4, which accounts for many of its drug-drug interactions.\n\nBecause the metabolism of phenytoin is predominantly by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, drugs that alter the function of these enzymes either by inducing or inhibiting phenytoin would require monitoring and possible medication adjustments to phenytoin based on resulting follow-up phenytoin levels.\n\nMedications that inhibit these enzymes increase the phenytoin plasma concentrations. Some of These drugs include amiodarone, cimetidine, cotrimoxazole, disulfiram, fluconazole, metronidazole, chloramphenicol, sodium valproate, 5-fluorouracil, and sulphonamides.\n\nMedications that induce the enzyme system to decrease plasma phenytoin concentrations include alcohol, barbiturates, carbamazepine, theophylline, rifampin, and other medications.\n[1]\n\nExcretion\n\n1% to 5% of the drug is excreted in the urine unchanged. At plasma concentrations below 10 mg/L, elimination will follow first-order kinetics; following saturation of the system due to increased drug concentrations, elimination changes to zero-order kinetics. Subsequently, the usual average half-life of 22 hours can become significantly prolonged with marked overdose.\n[1]\n\nMonitoring\n\nTherapeutic drug monitoring of phenytoin is necessary to ensure dosage delivery is at therapeutic levels. The therapeutic range for phenytoin is 10 to 20 mcg/mL.\n\nKnowledge of its pharmacokinetic properties is crucial for the correct interpretation of total serum concentrations when protein binding becomes altered due to hypoalbuminemia, renal failure, or interaction with other protein-bound drugs such as valproate.\n\nTheoretical equations such as the Sheiner-Tozer equation have been introduced to calculate adjusted serum concentration levels and avoid inappropriate adjustment of the dosage of phenytoin. However, they have not seen broad implementation in clinical practice due to poor patient outcomes.\n\nA closer investigation of total serum phenytoin and serum albumin ratio by healthcare providers is critical for proper monitoring of phenytoin therapy.\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]",
    "toxicity": "Phenytoin displays its primary signs of toxicity on the nervous and cardiovascular systems. Overdose of oral phenytoin mainly causes neurotoxicity, whereas cardiovascular toxicity is the main side effect of parenteral administration.\n\nNeurotoxicity\n\nThe neurotoxic effects are concentration-dependent and can range from mild nystagmus to ataxia, slurred speech, vomiting, lethargy, and eventually coma and death. The following is a generalized correlation of side effects with\ntotal\nplasma phenytoin concentrations (the value obtained via most laboratories):\n\nBelow 10 mg/L: Rare side effects\n10 to 20 mg/L: Occasional mild horizontal nystagmus on lateral gaze\n20 to 30 mg/L: Nystagmus\n30 to 40 mg/L: Ataxia, slurred speech, tremors, nausea, and vomiting\n40 to 50 mg/L: Lethargy, confusion, hyperactivity\nOver 50 mg/L: Coma and seizures\n\nSeizures are infrequent and usually occur at very high serum concentrations. The presence of seizures with phenytoin overdose should prompt the search for other causes.\n[4]\n\nCardiac Toxicity\n\nPhenytoin is a Class IB antiarrhythmic; its suppressant effects on the cardiac voltage-gated sodium channels can lead to dysrhythmias as well as sinoatrial and atrioventricular blocks. These effects rarely occur with oral administration. However, in the intravenous form, the primary toxicity is believed to be from propylene glycol, which is a cardiac depressant; rapid infusions of phenytoin can lead to bradycardia, hypotension, and asystole. Care must be taken not to administer intravenous phenytoin at a rate faster than 50 mg per minute.\n[4]\n\nOther Toxicities\n\n“Purple glove syndrome” is a rare side effect that can accompany the intravenous administration of phenytoin. The worsening limb edema and discoloration appear to result from the crystallization of phenytoin within the blood. When there is extensive skin necrosis and limb ischemia, this can lead to amputations.\n[8]\n\nChronic Toxicity\n\nChronic intake of phenytoin can lead to megaloblastic anemia due to folate deficiency, peripheral neuropathy, or lupus-like syndrome. These are not commonly reported in acute overdoses.\n\nToxicokinetics\n\nDue to its metabolism by the CP450 microsomal enzyme system, drugs that alter their function can place the patient at risk for toxicity by increasing the plasma phenytoin concentrations. These include amiodarone, cimetidine, cotrimoxazole, disulfiram, fluconazole, metronidazole, chloramphenicol, sodium valproate, 5-fluorouracil, and sulphonamides.\n[4]\n\nManagement\n\nThere is no specific antidote for phenytoin toxicity; supportive care is the hallmark of treatment."
