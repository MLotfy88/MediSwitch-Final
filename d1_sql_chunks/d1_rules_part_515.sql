Because NSAIDs reduce the rate of ulcer healing in the stomach and duodenum, it is also possible that NSAIDs may delay healing and exaggerate the mucosal injury caused by oral bisphosphonates. Theoretical concerns exist regarding the potential for increased risk and severity of renal impairment during coadministration of bisphosphonates with high dosages or chronic use of NSAIDs due to additive or synergistic nephrotoxic effects on the kidney. The use of bisphosphonates has been associated with nephrotoxicity manifested as deterioration of renal function and renal failure. Cases have primarily involved intravenous formulations of the drugs such as pamidronic acid and zoledronic acid, especially when they are administered too rapidly. The risk of hypocalcemia may also be increased, as drug-induced renal tubular damage can lead to renal loss of calcium and other electrolytes such as magnesium. Bisphosphonates alone often cause mild, asymptomatic hypocalcemia via inhibitive effects on bone resorption and possibly chelation of blood calcium. Chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be associated with renal toxicities including elevations in serum creatinine and BUN, tubular necrosis, glomerulitis, renal papillary necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and renal failure.', NULL, 'Caution is advised if bisphosphonates are prescribed in combination with NSAIDs.', NULL, 'Caution is advised if bisphosphonates are prescribed in combination with NSAIDs.
