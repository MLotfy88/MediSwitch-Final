    "clinical_significance": "The care of patients requires meeting the needs of individuals and families' cultures and beliefs. Religion often provides spiritual guidance as well as an emphasis on maintaining health. Religious beliefs often affect patient attitudes and behavior. It is important for healthcare professionals to have an understanding of these issues so they can provide culturally appropriate care. It is important to remember that preservation of life overrides guidelines; in a life-threatening situation, there are usually no restrictions on medications or surgical interventions. When caring for a patient, it is important to understand why adherence or non-adherence to treatment may occur given their religious beliefs.\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n\nEnhancing cultural competency by providing patient-centered care is the means by which healthcare challenges are ameliorated. Efforts aimed to improve provider-level cultural enhanced care will go a long way to facilitate cross-cultural communication and respond to patient needs by tailoring healthcare.\n\nUnderstanding the values and reasons for special requests for healthcare will improve cultural competence and provide culturally sensitive health care that is good for the patient and their families.\n\nThe culture and religion of an individual can greatly influence their perspectives about healthcare and healthcare providers. Healthcare providers need knowledge and understanding of these patients’ backgrounds and beliefs to provide culturally sensitive healthcare.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nApologize for cultural mistakes\nAsk the patient and family how you can help make their experience more comfortable.\nAvoid being judgmental\nAvoid making assumptions and be patient.\nAvoid employees serving as interpreters for other employees.\nBe aware of the uniqueness of their religion and their special needs.\nBe respectful\nObserve body and facial language\nRecognize how values, behaviors, and beliefs may affect others\nTrain staff about cultural competence\nUse medically competent and fluent interpreters with training in cultural competence."
