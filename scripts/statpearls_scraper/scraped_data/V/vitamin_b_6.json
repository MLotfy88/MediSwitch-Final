    "indications": "Tetramethylenedisulfoteramine (tetramine) is a rodenticide that causes severe neurotoxicity. Though internationally banned, tetramine is still manufactured. There are numerous cases of poisoning, especially in rural areas. This agent is available through illicit markets in multiple countries and is relatively inexpensive.\n[1]\n\nDue to its chemical stability, ease of production, lack of taste or smell, and rapid onset of toxicity, tetramine has been discussed as a possible candidate for a chemical threat agent.",
    "mechanism": "Tetramine is an inexpensive rodenticide frequently sold outside the United States, where it is manufactured. Due to the regulations around its manufacture, sale, and ownership, it is sometimes purchased from illegal vendors.",
    "monitoring": "Diagnosis is mainly clinical, and the primary managing team must maintain a high index of suspicion for tetramine toxicity. There are case reports of documented electroencephalography (EEG) changes, including diffuse slow waves, spike-and-slow waves, and sharp and slow waves in children.\n[13]\nLeukocytosis, rhabdomyolysis, and thrombocytopenia are reported in documented cases.\n[3]\n\nMultiple studies describe diagnostic testing; however, these tests are not readily available, limiting their benefit in the clinical setting. Gas chromatography with nitrogen phosphorous detection is described as a sensitive technique to detect tetramine.\n[14]\nOther methodologies described include gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy.\n[15]\n\nNo pathognomonic findings are reported on CT imaging or MRI for tetramine toxicity.\n\nFindings on autopsy note lung edema and congestion in all documented cases.\n[3]\nThere is bleeding in most organs, with subarachnoid hemorrhage found in 27.5% of cases on autopsy review.\n[3]\nThe mechanism for multi-site hemorrhages is unclear and may be related to sequelae of intractable seizures, although this is inconclusive.",
    "administration": "Universal precautions are recommended to limit exposure to healthcare providers. As stated earlier, tetramine is unlikely to be absorbed through intact skin.\n\nTreatment should be started as early as possible as tetramine is rapidly absorbed after oral ingestion, and neurotoxicity occurs suddenly.\n\nGastric Decontamination\n\nIn acute confirmed ingestions, it is reasonable to consider gastric decontamination. The LD50 of tetramine is such that decreasing absorption may mitigate toxicity. However, no robust data or human studies suggest mortality benefits. Regardless, gastric lavage has been reported as a recommended treatment by clinicians with experience treating tetramine poisoning.\n[16]\n\nAn animal study on the effects of activated charcoal use in tetramine-poisoned rabbits demonstrated a decrease in the elimination half-life by 55% and a reduction in the area under the curve by 70%, indicating tetramine is readily bound by activated charcoal.\n[10]\nThis data would suggest that activated charcoal may be beneficial in early presentations. However, given the high likelihood of seizures, the risk of aspiration must be considered if the patient's airway is not protected through endotracheal tube placement.\n\nThere are no studies on biliary recirculation, and the benefit of multi-dose activated charcoal is unclear.\n\nPharmacologic Treatment\n\nA distinctive characteristic of tetramine toxicity is refractory seizures. Multiple classes of drugs have been studied in animals with variable effects. Aggressive and early escalating treatment is recommended regardless of the agents chosen to treat tetramine toxicity. In a case series of 15 patients with tetramine toxicity, the authors advocate for early mechanical ventilation to avoid any hesitancy in escalating treatment with benzodiazepines.\n[16]\n\nBenzodiazepines\n\nBenzodiazepines are one of the more common agents used in reported cases. Molecular studies demonstrated midazolam had the best inhibition of tetramine binding to the GABA receptor compared to diazepam and phenobarbitol. However, this has not been studied in humans.\n[17]\nA comparison in an animal poisoning model noted both high-dose diazepam and midazolam improved survival.\n[18]\nAnimal studies reported improvement in seizure resolution with diazepam but no change in death rate at 60 minutes.\n[19]\n\nSedative Hypnotics\n\nEarly animal studies suggest aggressive sedative therapy with an agent such as phenobarbital is beneficial.\n[20]\n\nMolecular studies suggested propofol appears to have similar efficacy as midazolam in blocking tetramine binding to the GABA receptor.\n[17]\n\nNMDA Receptor Inhibitors\n\nKetamine was studied in mice, and with higher doses (70 mg/kg intraperitoneal), convulsions decreased, and the 60-minute death rate was decreased.\n[19]\n\nAdjuncts\n\nWhere tetramine cases are more commonly seen, treatment adjuncts are used frequently. Randomized controlled trials in humans for these adjuncts are lacking, and reports of the effects are limited to animal studies and case reports/series.\n\nPyridoxine\n\nVitamin B6 has been reported as a helpful adjunct in cases of tetramine toxicity. Data is limited on efficacy, and the exact mechanism is unclear. As previously mentioned, tetramine is a noncompetitive inhibitor of the GABAa receptor. Pyridoxine is used in other poisons that cause neurotoxicity, such as gyromitra and isoniazid toxicity. These agents contribute to seizures by depleting the active form of pyridoxine, pyridoxal 5-phosphate, an essential cofactor in GABA formation. Animal studies have demonstrated that pyridoxine combined with sodium 2,3-dimercaptopropanesulfonate (DMPS) decreased convulsions.\n[21]\n\nSodium 2,3-dimercaptopropanesulfonate (DMPS)\n\nDMPS, a chelating agent for heavy metals, has been suggested as a treatment modality for tetramine-poisoned patients. In addition to being used as a combination treatment with pyridoxine, animal studies demonstrated the potential benefit of DMPS alone. Proposed mechanisms involve the sulfhydryl groups and their ability to modulate the function of various ion channels. Rat studies showed decreased convulsions with DMPS alone due to the potentiation of GABA at the receptor site.\n[22]\n\nMedication Adjuncts Under Investigation\n\nNeurosteroids\n\nNeurosteroids are another class of drugs undergoing research as a treatment for tetramine toxicity. Neurosteroids interact with GABAa receptors both in the synaptic cleft and at extrasynaptic GABAa receptors, the latter of which are not sensitive to benzodiazepines.\n[23]\nActivation of these extrasynaptic receptors leads to tonic inhibition instead of phasic inhibition at the synaptic cleft.\n[7]\nNeurosteroids are positive allosteric modulators and can increase benzodiazepine affinity to the GABAa receptor when bound at the same complex.\n[24]\n\nIn addition to the modulating effects of neurosteroids, there appears to be a synergistic effect of benzodiazepines and neurosteroids. Combination therapy of diazepam and allopregnanolone (a neurosteroid used to treat postpartum depression) demonstrated normalization of tetramine-induced synchronous calcium oscillations in rodents and improved survival from ten percent to 90%.\n[25]\n\nExtracorporeal Removal\n\nExtracorporeal removal of tetramine has been implemented in many instances of poisoning through various modalities, including plasma exchange, hemodialysis (HD), high volume hemofiltration (HVHF), continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH), and charcoal hemoperfusion. There have not been large comparison studies in humans. Expert opinion on this as a treatment is mixed, and recommendations vary.\n[26]\n[15]\n[27]\nIf extracorporeal is used as treatment, early initiation may result in decreased time to recovery based on a case series.\n[28]\n\nCharcoal hemoperfusion appears to be the more common modality, as studies have demonstrated that this method does remove tetramine from the body quickly. A two-hour session removed 1 mg of tetramine (measured from the perfusion device) when the initial plasma concentration was 100 mcg/L.\n[26]\nThat result is compared to urinary excretion of 80 mcg at 48 hours recorded in the same study. Lab analysis also showed decreased efficacy during longer sessions, suggesting that the perfusion filter was saturated with tetramine and became ineffective.\n[26]\nA logistical issue is charcoal hemoperfusion is not reliably available, even in large metropolitan hospitals, which may affect treatment strategy.\n[29]\n\nThere are conflicting reports concerning extracorporeal removal. Some studies document pre-filtration and post-filtration concentrations in patients and note no significant change in concentration, bringing into question the efficacy of extracorporeal removal.\n[26]\nOther case series also note this phenomenon with a recurrence of seizures in the days following hemoperfusion.\n[13]\nHowever, different case series document improvement in tetramine concentrations after hemoperfusion, suggesting that the conflicting results are more likely related to the differences in tetramine amount ingested for each individual in the reported cases.\n[30]\n\nGiven the distribution of tetramine throughout the body, this observation is thought to be more likely due to the redistribution of tetramine from body tissues into the serum, as studies have documented that tetramine is removed by charcoal hemoperfusion by directly analyzing the filter contents.\n[26]\n[15]\n\nA case of a patient that received high-volume hemofiltration seven days after poisoning noted a decrease in tetramine concentration from 0.95 mcg/mL to 0.35 mcg/mL. The following day the serum concentration rebounded to 0.53 mcg/mL, and charcoal hemoperfusion was performed, lowering the concentration to 0.40 mcg/mL.\n[12]\n\nSerum rebound is frequently reported in published cases. Thus, additional sessions may be indicated. Eighteen patients received hemoperfusion followed by CVVH, which was more effective at removing tetramine.\n[28]\nThis may mitigate rebound after hemoperfusion, though more study is needed.\n\nExtracorporeal Removal on Long-term Outcomes\n\nA case series of 17 children with an unintentional ingestion of tetramine compared outcome differences in those that received charcoal hemoperfusion and those that did not; the non-hemoperfusion group had a higher incidence of seizures.\n[13]\n\nEEG abnormalities were monitored at regular intervals, and the hemoperfusion group had a resolution of EEG abnormalities at six months, whereas the non-hemoperfusion group took a year to recover. This same study noted a quicker time to recovery in individuals that received multiple occurrences of hemoperfusion.\n[13]\nThis is reported in the literature, as stated previously.",
    "adverse_effects": "Complications surrounding tetramine toxicity are neurological in nature. Pediatric studies have documented prolonged EEG changes after treatment.\n[13]\n\nSeizures are a common complication after the acute toxicity phase. A follow-up study of 370 previously healthy poisoning survivors noted that 55% had seizures at follow-up. Of those who were seizure-free at the follow-up, most had been placed on antiepileptic medication initially and were seizure-free off the drug by an average of 2.3 years. Of the remaining 195 patients with seizures, most experienced tonic-clonic seizures, while the minority (39) had partial seizures.\n[31]\nOf those surveyed, a minority had other neurologic sequelae, such as gait instability, cognitive deficits, and intractable epilepsy.\n[31]\nThese long-term sequelae are also reported in case literature.\n[6]\n\nIt should be noted that a small number of patients with minor toxicity experience long-term complications of seizures without having seizures at the initial presentation. At follow-up in the previous observational study, all of these patients continued to have seizures."
