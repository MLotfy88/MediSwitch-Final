Since hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia are known risk factors for arrhythmia associated with QT prolongation, coadministration of dronedarone with agents that can cause significant potassium and/or magnesium loss (e.g., potassium-wasting diuretics, amphotericin B, cation exchange resins) may increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes and sudden death.', 'DDInter', 1767317476, 'Caution is advised if dronedarone must be used concomitantly with medications that can cause significant potassium and/or magnesium loss. Serum electrolytes should be evaluated at baseline and at regular intervals throughout the duration of therapy. Any abnormalities should be corrected prior to initiating therapy, and levels should be maintained within the normal range during treatment. Patients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms that could indicate the occurrence of torsade de pointes such as dizziness, palpitations, or syncope. Dronedarone should be discontinued if QTc Bazett interval increases to 500 ms or greater.', 'Synergism', 'Caution is advised if dronedarone must be used concomitantly with medications that can cause significant potassium and/or magnesium loss.', NULL, NULL, 'Major', 'pharmacodynamic');
