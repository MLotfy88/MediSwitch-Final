      "effect": "The antidiuretic response to vasopressin or desmopressin may be potentiated by certain drugs, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic/tetracyclic antidepressants, carbamazepine, chlorpropamide, chlorpromazine, clofibrate, eslicarbazepine, fludrocortisone, haloperidol, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, urea, and some antineoplastic agents (e.g., vinca alkaloids, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide). These drugs can occasionally cause fluid retention, in some cases secondary to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Coadministration with vasopressin or desmopressin may, therefore, increase the risk of water intoxication and/or hyponatremia. Seizure and coma in association with severe hyponatremia have been reported during concomitant use of desmopressin and imipramine or ibuprofen.",
      "management_text": "Caution is advised when vasopressin or desmopressin is used in combination with drugs that can cause fluid retention or SIADH. Some authorities recommend adjusting vasopressin dosage as needed. Serum electrolytes, especially sodium, as well as BUN and creatinine should be monitored regularly. Patients should be advised to seek medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms of water intoxication or hyponatremia such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, headache, malaise, lethargy, irritability, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, muscle spasm, unsteadiness (which may lead to falls), anuria, and weight gain. Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated; therefore, early treatment is important to help prevent progression to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, and death.",

The risk of symptomatic hypotension is increased in the presence of marked volume and/or salt depletion. In patients with type 2 diabetes and renal impairment, coadministration of aliskiren with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) has been associated with an increased risk of adverse events including renal complications, hyperkalemia, and hypotension.",

Prescribers should not initiate aliskiren in diabetic patients who are taking an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, and should stop any aliskiren-containing treatment if these patients are already receiving the combination. Alternative antihypertensive treatment should be considered as necessary. Most patients do not obtain any additional benefit from combination therapy relative to monotherapy; therefore, the potential risks should be thoroughly assessed when aliskiren is prescribed with ACE inhibitors or ARBs for the treatment of essential hypertension in patients without diabetes. Volume or salt depletion should be corrected prior to initiation of treatment. Routine monitoring of blood pressure, electrolytes, and renal function are recommended, particularly in the elderly or patients with worsening heart failure or a risk for dehydration. Potassium supplementation should generally be avoided unless it is closely monitored, and patients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience signs and symptoms of hyperkalemia such as weakness, listlessness, confusion, tingling of the extremities, and irregular heartbeat.",

Life-threatening and fatal hyperkalemia can occur, especially when the combination is used in patients with risk factors such as renal impairment, diabetes, old age, severe or worsening heart failure, dehydration, and concomitant use of other agents that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system or otherwise increase serum potassium levels.",

Serum potassium and renal function should be checked prior to initiating therapy and regularly thereafter, and potassium supplementation as well as the use of potassium-containing salt substitutes should be avoided unless absolutely necessary and the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Patients should be given counseling on the appropriate levels of potassium and fluid intake, and advised to seek medical attention if they experience signs and symptoms of hyperkalemia such as nausea, vomiting, weakness, listlessness, tingling of the extremities, paralysis, confusion, weak pulse, and a slow or irregular heartbeat.",
