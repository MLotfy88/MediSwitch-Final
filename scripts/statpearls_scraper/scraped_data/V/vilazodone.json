    "monitoring": "Laboratory studies including complete blood count with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, lipid panel, TSH, Vitamin D and toxicology screening are done to rule out other causes of depression such as hypothyroidism, alcoholism, vitamin D deficiency etc.  Nearly 30% of people with substance abuse problems have major or clinical depression. Other tests may sometimes include:\n\nCT scan or MRI of the brain to rule out serious illnesses such as a brain tumor or dementia\nElectroencephalogram (EEG) to record electrical activity of the brain such as in epilepsy\n\nIn most medical office settings, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9), a self-report instrument is commonly used to detect Major Depressive Disorder. In hospital settings, there are different scales such as Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) used to detect depression in patients. PHQ-9 is a 9-item self-administered diagnostic screening and severity tool based on current diagnostic criteria for major depression. HAM-D is a multiple choice questionnaire that may be used to rate the severity of a patient's depression. One of the other popular scales used is Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) which is a 21-question multiple-choice self-report that measures the severity of depression symptoms and feelings."
