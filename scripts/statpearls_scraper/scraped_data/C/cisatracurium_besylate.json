    "indications": "The major contraindications for organ transplantation are active infection, active malignancy, active drug abuse, reversible organ failure, uncontrollable psychiatry condition, non-compliance to treatment, and severe systemic condition with poor graft or patient survival. The recipient should wait for an organ transplant till infection or malignancy has been treated. For graft survival, it is essential to keep follow-up with the transplant team, regular clinic visits, blood work, and compliance with transplant medications. Hence, careful candidate selection becomes of utmost importance.\n[4]\n[5]",
    "clinical_significance": "Solid organ transplantations involving the kidney, pancreas, and liver pose a unique challenge perioperatively. Thorough preoperative evaluation and preparedness for anticipated complications during the surgery can improve surgical outcomes associated with these complex procedures."
