Severe\nCHF\nmay show at rest deep breathing with\ndyspnea\nwith distress\nEnlarged heart (ie\nASD\n) can cause bulging of chest\nOlder kids - activity causing\ndyspnea\n/cyanosis- keeping up with peers, grunting, coughing, tired from stairs.\nsyncope\n/presyncope, fatigue,\npalpitations\n/\nangina\ncan occur with\nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy\nYet older - Aortic valve with\nrheumatic fever\n,\nmyocarditis\n(history of\nURI\n),\nendocarditis\n(IV drug use)\nPregnancy history - Maternal diabetes (\nASD\n,\ncoarctation of the aorta\n, cardiomyopathies),\nCMV\n,\nCoxsackie\nB5,\nwarfarin\n,\nAEDs\nuse, EtOH (ASD,\nVSD\n), prematurity (\nPDA\n)\nWorry when - family history of [[\nHCM\n]]/sudden death and prominent apical thrust (indicates\nLVH\n)",
