      "text": "Consider antibiotic (e.g.\ncefazolin\n)\nIf possible; Elevate HOB to 30-60 degrees to lower diaphragm-decreasing risk of injury to diaphragm/intra-abdominal organs\nExpose insertion site by moving upper extremity above head on affected side\nInsertion site = mid- to ant axillary line at 4th/5th intercostal space\n~Nipple line in men, inframammary crease in women\nPlace 1-3 intercostal spaces higher in\npregnant\npatients (esp those in 3rd trimester) due to elevated diaphragm.\nClean with betadine and drape\nConfirm rib space and anesthetize with up to 5mg/kg of lido with or with out epinephrine\nMust anesthetize skin, soft tissue, muscle, periosteum, and pleural space\nIncise along upper border of the lower rib of the intercostal space\nUse curved clamp to bluntly dissect through the muscle until you reach the rib\nAngle the clamp to go above and over the rib and push until enter the pleural space\nOpen the clamp and pull it out with the clamp still open to create a larger tract\nPremeasure chest tube from skin incision to ipsi clavicle to avoid advancing chest tube too far\nClamp the prox end of the chest tube and pass it along the tract into the pleural cavity\nEnsure that inner tract/incision can fit your finger and tube\nIt helps to have your finger in the tract and pass the tube along your finger, particularly in obese patients\nOnce in the space, remove the clamp\nFeed the chest tube until all the holes are inside the thoracic cavity\nAim superoanterior for pneumothorax; aim posteriorly for hemothorax\nControversial as to whether this is important\nRotate the tube 360 degrees\nReduces likelihood of tube kinking\nIf tube rotates easily, can help indicate correct location inside pleural cavity\nAttach distal end of tube to the pleur-evac and place on suction (20-30cmH2O suction)\nSecure tube with silk suture and cover with gauze and cloth tape\nObtain CXR position of tube",
