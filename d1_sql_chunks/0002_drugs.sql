With reference to human use, there are 2 main forms of vitamin D - vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) and vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol). When non-specific references are made about ''vitamin d'', the references are usually about the use of vitamin D3 and/or D2.

Vitamin D3 and D2 require hydroxylation in order to become biologically active in the human body. Since vitamin D can be endogenously synthesized in adequate amounts by most mammals exposed to sufficient quantities of sunlight, vitamin D functions like a hormone on vitamin D receptors to regulate calcium in opposition to parathyroid hormone. Vitamin D plays an essential physiological role in maintaining calcium homeostasis and metabolism. There are several different vitamin D supplements that are given to treat or to prevent osteomalacia and rickets, or to meet the daily criteria of vitamin D consumption.','[]','[]'),(923,'Pro-lance 10 sachets 250 gm','برولانس 10 اكياس 250 جم','145','129.5','','','Company','Sachet','أكياس','250 gm','1','','','','',1755,'2025-06-18',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(925,'Arepexane 10mg 20 f.c. tab.','اريبكسان 10مجم 20 قرص','108','80','Psychiatric.antipsychotics','Aripiprazole','Delta pharma','Tab','أقراص','10mg','2','امراض نفسية','about aripiprazole second-generation atypical antipsychotic dopamine-serotonin stabilizer. mechanism of action of aripiprazole the mechanism of action of aripiprazole in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is unknown. the proposed mechanis','6221163010109','',1446,'2025-09-06',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic orally indicated for treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar I, major depressive disorder, irritability associated with autism, and Tourette''s[Label].

It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infections along with other antibiotics including [amoxicillin], [clarithromycin], and [metronidazole], for example.[A177271][F4498] Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [omeprazole], [esomeprazole], [lansoprazole], [dexlansoprazole], and [rabeprazole].

Pantoprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cell. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of pantoprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, pantoprazole''s duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as pantoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]

PPIs such as pantoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]

Pantoprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing as rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as pantoprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion.[A177574]','["A02BD04", "A02BD11", "A02BC02"]','[]'),(1025,'Aspirin protect 100mg 30 gastro-resistant tab','اسبرين بروتكت لحماية القلب 30 قرص','78','48','Nsaid.salicylates','Acetylsalicylic acid','Memphis > bayer bitterfeld gmbh-germany','Tab','أقراص','100mg','3','يعمل على منع تجمع الصفائح الدموية مما يساهم في الوقاية من أمراض القلب','','6221050032689','',28574,'2024-08-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Also known as _Aspirin_, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is a commonly used drug for the treatment of pain and fever due to various causes.

More recently, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies in rhesus monkeys have shown that atomoxetine also binds to the serotonin transporter (SERT),[A178111] and blocks the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor,[A18263] indicating a role for the glutamatergic system in the pathophysiology of ADHD. 

Long-acting formulations of psychostimulants (such as [DB00422], [DB01576], and [DB01255]) are typically considered the most effective and first-line treatment for ADHD in adults and children as recommended by CADDRA (Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance).[L6037] However, these stimulant medications are limited by dose-related side effects and concerns of abuse. Many contain a blackbox warning stating that CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate-containing products and amphetamines, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. In particular, increased dopamine in key areas caused by these stimulant medications is associated with their reinforcing and addictive properties, and even amplifies the potency and reinforcing effects of other drugs of abuse such as amphetamines, making ADHD sufferers more susceptible to their addictive effects.[A177556] Concerns about abuse potential have spurred research into medications with fewer effects on DA and the use of non-stimulant ADHD medications including atomoxetine, [DB00745] and [DB01018].

Atorvastatin was first synthesized in 1985 by Dr. Bruce Roth and approved by the FDA in 1996.[T568] It is a pentasubstituted pyrrole [A177415] formed by two contrasting moieties with an achiral heterocyclic core unit and a 3,5-dihydroxypentanoyl side chain identical to its parent compound.[T571] Unlike other members of the statin group, atorvastatin is an active compound and therefore does not require activation.[A177436]','["C10BA05", "C10BX11", "C10BX12", "C10BX18", "C10AA05", "C10BX15", "C10BX03", "C10BX08", "C10BX06"]','[]'),(1098,'Sibella fortified liquid chocolate','سيبيلا سائل بالشيكولاتة','90','70','For anemia and immunity','Iron+zinc+lactoferin','Medcare','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','لعلاج الانيميا ومقوي للمناعة','','8992500115198','',3262,'2024-10-24',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1101,'Schizocontrol 400 mg 10 f.c. tabs.','شيزو كنترول 400 مجم 10 قرص','57','','Psychiatric.antipsychotics','Amisulpride','Gypto pharma','Tab','أقراص','400 mg','1','','','','',968,'2022-09-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Amisulpride is a benzamide derivative and a dopamine receptor antagonist that selectively works on dopamine D2 and D3 receptors.

More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Rosuvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [simvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] This is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than [atorvastatin]''s effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial[A181427] concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.

Rosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]','["C10BX10", "C10BX05", "C10BX07", "C10AA07", "A10BH52", "G01AE10", "C10BX13", "C10BX09", "C10BA09", "C10BX16", "C10BX17", "C10BX14", "C10BA06"]','[]'),(1326,'Freevac 200gm massage spray','فريفاك مساج سبراي 200 جم','285','','Massage spray','Magnesium+menthol+camphor+eucalyptus','Invac therapeutics','Spray','بخاخ','200gm','1','','','6225000631311','',949,'2024-12-04',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1327,'B-com forte 30 f.c. tabs.','بي-كوم فورت 30 قرص','15','','Vitamin b','Vitamin b complex','Amoun','Tab','أقراص','','3','فيتامين ب المركب','mechanism of action of biotin biotin excerts it`s pharmacological action by influencing metabolic reactions. it acts as a coenzyme for carbohydrate fat and protein metabolism. it is required for cell growth and production of fatty acids. it is required fo','6221025019233','',4863,'2022-12-03',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1328,'Be active 30 capsules','بي اكتيف زيت جنين القمح 30 كبسولة','34','23.4','Vitamin e','Wheat germ oil','Safe pharma > ema pharm','Capsule','كبسولة','','2','','be active is a powerful antioxidant & free radical scavenger which can function in general as a biological antioxidant to protect cellular membranes from oxidative destruction. be active is a soft gelatin capsule with no gastric trouble and superior bioav','6224000912055','',5318,'2024-03-14',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1330,'Methyl folate 400 mcg (nhs) 20 tabs.','ميثيل فوليت 400مكجم 20 قرص','79','','Active form of folic','L- methyl folate','Nour health services (nhs)','Tab','أقراص','400 mcg','1','','','6225000621916','',897,'2022-09-04',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1331,'Donazil 5 mg 20 odt tab.','دونازيل 5مجم 20 قرص','88','','Central acetylcholinesterase inhibitor','Donepezil','Eva pharma','Tab','أقراص','5 mg','2','','','','',922,'2022-12-03',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'In 2016, the global burden of dementia was estimated to be 43.8 million, demonstrating a significant increase from a global prevalence of 20.2 million in 1990.[A182411] Donepezil, also known as Aricept, is a piperidine derivative acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used in the management of the dementia of Alzheimer''s Disease, and in some cases, is used to manage other types of dementia.

which are used to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and manage elevated lipid levels by inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Rosuvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [simvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] This is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than [atorvastatin]''s effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial[A181427] concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.

Rosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]','["C10BX10", "C10BX05", "C10BX07", "C10AA07", "A10BH52", "G01AE10", "C10BX13", "C10BX09", "C10BA09", "C10BX16", "C10BX17", "C10BX14", "C10BA06"]','[]'),(1377,'Omega-3 enriched 40 softgels (adrien gagnon)','اوميجا 3 انريتش 40 كبسولة','650','','OMEGA-3','Omega-3','Egypharma','Gel','جل','','1','','','','',1114,'2022-09-04',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'C10AX06',NULL),(1379,'Benalex 120ml syrup','بينالكس 120 مل شراب','8','','Cough drugs','Ammonium chloride-diphenhydramine','Alexandria','Syrup','شراب','120ml','1','','','6223000171141','',1049,'2022-12-03',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1380,'Nutritru b12 tabs','نوتريترو ب12 اقراص','40','','','','Marcyrl pharmaceutical industries (mpi)','Tab','أقراص','','1','','','','',862,'2022-09-04',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL);

It is primarily used for the treatment of respiratory, enteric and genitourinary infections and may be used instead of other macrolides for some sexually transmitted and enteric infections. It is structurally related to erythromycin [A174169].

Azithromycin [9-deoxo-9a-aza-9a-methyl-9a-homoerythromycin] is a part of the _azalide_ subclass of macrolides, and contains a 15-membered ring, with a methyl-substituted nitrogen instead of a carbonyl group at the 9a position on the aglycone ring, which allows for the prevention of its metabolism. This differentiates azithromycin from other types of macrolides [A174175].

In March 2020, a small study was funded by the French government to investigate the treatment of COVID-19 with a combination of azithromycin and the anti-malaria drug [hydroxychloroquine].

Structurally, ergocalciferol differs from cholecalciferol in that it possesses a double bond between C22 and C23 and has an additional methyl group at C24 [L5689]. Finally, ergocalciferol is pharmacologically less potent than cholecalciferol, which makes vitamin D3 the preferred agent for medical use [L5689].

Appropriate levels of vitamin D must be upheld in the body in order to maintain calcium and phosphorus levels in a healthy physiologic range to sustain a variety of metabolic functions, transcription regulation, and bone metabolism [A223, L5689, L1782, L5771, F4027, F4042, F4048].

It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infections along with other antibiotics including [DB01060], [DB01211], and [DB00916], for example.[A177271, F4498] Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [DB00338], [DB00213], [DB00448], [DB05351], and [DB01129]. Esomeprazole is the s-isomer of [DB00338], which is a racemate of the S- and R-enantiomer. Esomeprazole has been shown to inhibit acid secretion to a similar extent as [DB00338], without any significant differences between the two compounds _in vitro_. 

Esomeprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of esomeprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, esomeprazole''s duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]

PPIs such as esomeprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as esomeprazole has been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients such as iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]

Rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as esomeprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion.[A177574] Esomeprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing to prevent this rebound effect.','["A02BD06", "A02BC05", "M01AE52"]','[]'),(1567,'Viridio whitening 200 ml facial cleanser','فيريدو وايتننج منظف للوجه 200 مل','155','','Facial cleanser','Liposomal vitamin c+derma white+alpha arbutin+ceramide','Yami pharmaceutical','Cleanser','منظف','200 ml','1','','','','',833,'2023-04-28',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1568,'Ivyrate 100ml syrup','ايفيرات شراب 100 مل','50','','Dietry supplement','Ivy leaf extract+thyme leaf extract+grapefruit+vit c+zinc+vit d3+honey','Noval','Syrup','شراب','100ml','1','','','','',787,'2023-04-28',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1571,'Bio-tech 400 gram powder','بيو-تك 400 جم باودر','185','149.9','Dietary supplement','','Bio pharma egypt','Powder','بودرة','','1','','','','',1897,'2024-10-30',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1572,'Cortex 75 ml shampoo','كورتكس شامبو 75 مل','77','31.95','Anti dandruff','Clotrimazole+selenium sulfide+zinc pyrithione','Evexia pharma','Amp','أمبول','75 ml','1','','','','',1060,'2024-04-16',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1575,'Dronalo 30 ml drops','درونالو نقط 30 مل','52','','Vitamin d3','Vitamin d3','Squibal','Drops','نقط','30 ml','1','','','','',977,'2022-09-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1576,'Biotin & bepanthene 500 amp','بايوتين و بيبانثين 500 امبول','700','','Vitamin b supplement','Vitamin b5','Puritans pride','Amp','أمبول','','500','امبولات فيتامين ب مفيدة للشعر -- تقويته وعلاج التساقط -- تنعيم الشعر','','3400936909045','',1671,'2023-08-01',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1578,'Regetone cream 100 gm','ريجيتون كريم 100 جم','350','250','Skin care','Collagen+royal jelly+vit.c+caffeine+co-q10+antioxidants','Master med pharma','Cream','كريم','100 gm','1','','','','',917,'2025-08-04',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1579,'Biotin 5000 mcg 60 veg. caps.

Aaron B. Lerner of Yale University is credited for naming the hormone and for defining its chemical structure in 1958.  In mammals, melatonin is produced by the pineal gland. The pineal gland is small endocrine gland, about the size of a rice grain and shaped like a pine cone (hence the name), that is located in the center of the brain (rostro-dorsal to the superior colliculus) but outside the blood-brain barrier. The secretion of melatonin increases in darkness and decreases during exposure to light, thereby regulating the circadian rhythms of several biological functions, including the sleep-wake cycle. In particular, melatonin regulates the sleep-wake cycle by chemically causing drowsiness and lowering the body temperature.  Melatonin is also implicated in the regulation of mood, learning and memory, immune activity, dreaming, fertility and reproduction. Melatonin is also an effective antioxidant.  Most of the actions of melatonin are mediated through the binding and activation of melatonin receptors. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may have lower than normal levels of melatonin. A 2008 study found that unaffected parents of individuals with ASD also have lower melatonin levels, and that the deficits were associated with low activity of the ASMT gene, which encodes the last enzyme of melatonin synthesis. Reduced melatonin production has also been proposed as a likely factor in the significantly higher cancer rates in night workers.','["N05CH01"]','[]'),(1647,'Bonorexage 60 gm massage gel','بونوريكساج مساج جل 60 جم','60','50','Gel massage','Camphor+olive oil+salicylate+liposome','First aid pharma','Gel','جل','60 gm','1','','','','',944,'2024-11-25',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1649,'Bon-one 0.5 mcg 30 tabs.','بون-ون 0.5مكجم 30 قرص','123','82.5','Vitamin d','Alfacalcidol','Mina pharm > teijin limited-japan','Tab','أقراص','0.5 mcg','3','علاج نقص فيتامين دال -- التعب و الارهاق -- تحسين امتصاص الكالسيوم','description : alfacalcidol is an active metabolite of vitamin d indication : prescribed for hypocalcaemia hypoparathyroidism hypophosphataemia renal osteodystrophy and osteomalacia. dosage : adult- po- the recommended starting dose is 1mcg/day. maintenanc','6222003701393','',10556,'2024-10-30',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'A11CC03',NULL),(1650,'Vitajar 20 sublingual tabs','فيتاجار 20 قرص تحت اللسان','99','','Multivitamins','B9 folic acid+b12+b6','Treato pharm','Tab','أقراص','','1','','','','',994,'2024-11-25',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1651,'Axal massage oil 10 ml','اكسال زيت مساج اويل 10 مل','85','','Massage','','Cira pharma','Oil','زيت','10 ml','1','','','','',924,'2024-05-27',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1652,'Bonapex 10mg 30 tab.','بونابكس 10مجم 30 قرص','90','','Osteoporosis.bisphosphonates','Alendronate','Multi-apex','Tab','أقراص','10mg','3','','about alendronate sodium bisphosphonate derivative bone resorption inhibitor. mechanism of action of alendronate sodium it preferentially localized to the sites of action and inhibits prenylation of gtp-binding proteins involved in cytoskeletal organizati','','',1154,'2022-10-22',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1653,'Pectigo 7 sachets','بكتيجو 7 اكياس','50','','Diarrhea','Probiotics+prebiotics','Recovery pharma','Sachet','أكياس','','1','','','','',1118,'2024-05-30',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1654,'Melaakne soap 100 gm','ميلاكني صابونة 100 جم','60','','Anti-acne','Sulfur 5%+salicylic acid 0.5%+d-panthenol+almond oil+glycerin+honey+aloe vera extract+wheat germ','Melano pharma','Soap','صابون','100 gm','1','','','','',860,'2024-06-01',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1655,'Bonapex 70mg 4 f.c.tabs.','بونابكس 70مجم 4 قرص','80','','Osteoporosis','Alendronate','Multi-apex','Tab','أقراص','70mg','1','','indication for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in women and paget s disease of bone in both men and women. mechanism of action the action of alendronate on bone tissue is based partly on its affinity for hydroxyapatite which is part of the mi','6223003200152','',2642,'2022-12-03',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1656,'Revivoderm cream 60 gm','ريفيفوديرم كريم 60 جم','114','78','','Silver sulfadiazine+sodium hyaluronate','Marcyrl','Cream','كريم','60 gm','1','','','6223003572297','',2058,'2025-04-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'D08AL30',NULL),(1657,'Melano melo oint','ميلانو ميلو مرهم','80','','','','Melano pharma','Oint','مرهم','','1','','','','',938,'2024-06-11',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1658,'Krippzan 30 gm skin ointment','كريبزان مرهم 30 مجم','85','','Burn and wound healing cream','Retinol+niacinamide+cucurbita pepo seed oil+olea europaea fruit oil+sesamum indicum seed oil+beeswax+tocopherol +','Eagle one pharma','Ointment','مرهم','30 gm','1','','','','',843,'2022-04-14',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1661,'Bone care 0.5 mcg 30 caps. 30 cap.','بون كير 0.5مكجم 30 كبسولة','129','88.5','Vitamin d','Alfacalcidol','Arab caps > multicare','Cap','كبسولة','0.5 mcg','3','مصدر هام من مصادر فيتامين د __ يساعد علي امتصاص الكالسيوم بالجسم __ مقوي للعظام','','6224007326091','',19500,'2024-08-03',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'A11CC03',NULL);

It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infections along with other antibiotics including [DB01060], [DB01211], and [DB00916], for example.[A177271, F4498] Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [DB00338], [DB00213], [DB00448], [DB05351], and [DB01129]. Esomeprazole is the s-isomer of [DB00338], which is a racemate of the S- and R-enantiomer. Esomeprazole has been shown to inhibit acid secretion to a similar extent as [DB00338], without any significant differences between the two compounds _in vitro_. 

Esomeprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of esomeprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, esomeprazole''s duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]

PPIs such as esomeprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as esomeprazole has been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients such as iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]

Rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as esomeprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion.[A177574] Esomeprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing to prevent this rebound effect.','["A02BD06", "A02BC05", "M01AE52"]','[]'),(1664,'Iron direct 20 sachets','ايرون دايركت 20 كيس','500','','Iron supplement','Iron+folic acid+vitamin b6+vitamin c','Deutsche pharma','Sachet','أكياس','','1','','','','',2181,'2024-06-27',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1666,'Krippzan 50 gm massage gel','كريبزان مرهم 50 مجم','60','','Massage cream','Menthol+eucalyptus oil+camphor+thymus vulgaris oil+mentha piperita oil+curcuma longa rhizome oil+nigella sativa seed oil+boswellia carterii oil+arginine','Eagle one pharma','Gel','جل','50 gm','1','','','','',941,'2022-10-28',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1667,'Bonidon 75mg 20 depocaps','بونيدون 75مجم 20 كبسولة','16','','Nsaid.acetic acid derivatives','Indomethacin','Mup > acino','Cap','كبسولة','75mg','2','','','6221508020817','',1000,'2022-12-03',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Indometacin, or indomethacin, is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic properties. NSAIDs consist of agents that are structurally unrelated; the NSAID chemical classification of indometacin is an indole-acetic acid derivative with the chemical name 1- (p-chlorobenzoyl)25-methoxy-2-methylindole-3-acetic acid.[A177871] The pharmacological effect of indometacin is not fully understood, however, it is thought to be mediated through potent and nonselective inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), which is the main enzyme responsible for catalyzes the rate-limiting step in prostaglandin and thromboxane biosynthesis via the arachidonic acid (AA) pathway. Indometacin was first discovered in 1963 and it was first approved for use in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration in 1965, [A486] along with other acetic acid derivatives such as [diclofenac] and [sulindac] that were also developed during the 1960s.[A177871] Since then, indometacin has been extensively studied in clinical trials as one of the most potent NSAIDs in blocking prostaglandin synthesis and was among the first NSAIDs to be used in the symptomatic treatment of migraine and for headaches that eventually became known as “indomethacin-responsive” headache disorders.[A177871] 

Most commonly used in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritis, acute shoulder pains, and acute gouty arthritis, indometacin is currently available as oral capsules as well as other methods of administration, including rectal and intravenous formulations. Intravenous indometacin is administered to close a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus, as indicated by clinical evidence, in premature infants.[L10553] Ophthalmic indometacin has been studied and used in the symptomatic treatment of postoperative ocular inflammation and pain and/or complications after cataract surgery. Although deemed effective in reducing ocular inflammation in clinical studies, topical NSAIDs were also associated with a potential reduction in corneal sensitivity accompanied by an increased risk of superficial punctate keratitis and subjective symptoms of discomfort, including pain, burning or pricking, or a tingling sensation after instillation into the cul‐de‐sac.[A177949]','["S01CC02", "M01AB51", "S01BC01", "M02AA23", "M01AB01", "C01EB03"]','[]'),(1669,'Green hirt extract 30cap','جرين هيرت اكستراكت 30 كبسولة','180','','Food supplement','Green coffee extract+green tea extract+garcinia extract','Hirta care','Cap','كبسولة','','3','','','','',1130,'2024-07-10',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1670,'Bon-one 0.25 mcg 30 tabs.','بون-ون 0.25مكجم 30 قرص','90','58.5','Vitamin d','Alfacalcidol','Mina pharm > teijin limited-japan','Tab','أقراص','0.25 mcg','3','علاج نقص فيتامين دال','description : alfacalcidol is an active metabolite of vitamin d indication : prescribed for hypocalcaemia hypoparathyroidism hypophosphataemia renal osteodystrophy and osteomalacia. dosage : adult- po- the recommended starting dose is 1mcg/day. maintenanc','6222003701379','',4092,'2024-10-30',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'A11CC03',NULL),(1673,'Cogicin 1000mcg 30 tabs','كوجيسين 1000مكجم 30 قرص','95','60','','','Kemit pharma','Tab','أقراص','1000mcg','3','','','','',2397,'2025-06-23',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1674,'Bonprove 150 mg 3 f.c. tablets','بونبروف 150مجم 3 اقراص','66','','Osteoporosis.antiresorptives','Ibandronic acid','Eva pharma','Tablet','أقراص','150 mg','1','','dose : one tablet 150 mg taken once monthly on the same date each month','6223002458554','',1517,'2023-04-10',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'M05BA06',NULL),(1675,'Vatika hair cream 125 ml','فاتيكا كريم شعر 125 مل','70','','','','Company','Cream','كريم','125 ml','1','','','6224007940488','',924,'2022-12-03',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1676,'Melaopti cream 50gram','ميلااوبتي كريم 50 جم','109','','Whitening cream','Niacinamide+kojic acid+vit c','Italian factory > sparkmed pharmaceuticals','Cream','كريم','','1','','melaopti whitening cream for all types of skin hyperpigmentation','','',908,'2024-11-25',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1678,'Borgastatin 40mg 10 tab.','بورجاستاتين 40مجم 10 اقراص','53','45','Antihyperlipidemic.statins','Atorvastatin','Borg','Tab','أقراص','40mg','1','','description : is a member of the drug class known as statins. dose: adult po- initial- the recommended dose is 10 mg daily. maximum: 80 mg/day. indication : may be used as primary prevention in individuals with multiple risk factors for coronary heart dis','6223002570072','',1494,'2024-11-03',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Atorvastatin (Lipitor®), is a lipid-lowering drug included in the statin class of medications. By inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver, statins lower abnormal cholesterol and lipid levels, and ultimately reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid. This conversion is a critical metabolic reaction involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport, including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing statins is considered standard practice for patients following any cardiovascular event, and for people who are at moderate to high risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The evidence supporting statin use, coupled with minimal side effects and long term benefits, has resulted in wide use of this medication in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Atorvastatin and other statins including [lovastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [simvastatin] are considered first-line treatment options for dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] The increasing use of this class of drugs is largely attributed to the rise in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (such as heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke) in many countries.[A181084] An elevated cholesterol level (elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in particular) is a significant risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Several landmark studies demonstrate that the use of statins is associated with both a reduction in LDL levels and CVD risk.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins were shown to reduce the incidences of all-cause mortality, including fatal and non-fatal CVD, as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Some evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within five years) statin use leads to a 20%-22% relative reduction in the number of major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

Atorvastatin was first synthesized in 1985 by Dr. Bruce Roth and approved by the FDA in 1996.[T568] It is a pentasubstituted pyrrole [A177415] formed by two contrasting moieties with an achiral heterocyclic core unit and a 3,5-dihydroxypentanoyl side chain identical to its parent compound.[T571] Unlike other members of the statin group, atorvastatin is an active compound and therefore does not require activation.[A177436]','["C10BA05", "C10BX11", "C10BX12", "C10BX18", "C10AA05", "C10BX15", "C10BX03", "C10BX08", "C10BX06"]','[]'),(1679,'Borgasone 0.1% cream 20 gm','بورجازون كريم 20 جرام','35','24','Anti-inflammatory.glucocorticoid.','Mometasone furoate','Borg','Cream','كريم','0.1%','1','مضاد للالتهابات الجلدية -- تقليل الحساسية الجلدية -- تقليل الاحمرار والحكة --','about mometasone a glucocorticoid steroid anti psoriatic anti asthma anti inflammatory. mechanism of action of mometasone mometasone is a topical medium potency glucocorticoid. the drug exerts its pharmacological action by penetrating and binding to cytop','6223002570133','',16130,'2024-06-14',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1680,'Borgasone plus oint. 30 gm','بورجازون بلس مرهم 30 جرام','36','24','Anti-inflammatory.glucocorticoid','Mometasone furoate','Borg','Oint','مرهم','30 gm','1','مضاد للحساسية والتهابات الجلد','mometasone + salicylic acid pregnancy related information use with caution old age related information use with caution breast feeding related information use with caution children related information use with caution neonates:contra indicated indications','6223002571345','',2868,'2024-09-12',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1681,'Borgasone 0.1% lotion 20 ml','بورجازون لوشن غسول 20 مل','33','22','Anti-inflammatory.glucocorticoid.','Mometasone furoate','Borg','Lotion','لوشن','0.1%','1','كريم مضاد للالتهابات يستخدم فى علاج أعراض بعض الأمراض الجلدية ، مثل الألم أو الاحمرار أو الدفء أو التورم أو الحكة','about mometasone a glucocorticoid steroid anti psoriatic anti asthma anti inflammatory. mechanism of action of mometasone mometasone is a topical medium potency glucocorticoid. the drug exerts its pharmacological action by penetrating and binding to cytop','6223002570157','',3076,'2024-06-14',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1682,'Borgavix 75mg 30 f.c. tablets','بورجافيكس 75 مجم 30 قرص','66','45','Antiplatelet.adp receptor blocker','Clopidogrel','Borg','Tablet','أقراص','75mg','3','عامل مضاد للصفحيات يستخدم في علاج متلازمة الشريان التاجي الحادة والسكتة الدماغية وأمراض القلب الإقفارية والقسطرة القلبية وجراحة','about clopidogrel thienopyridine class platelet aggregation inhibitor antithrombic anti platelet agent. mechanism of action of clopidogrel the drug exerts it`s antithrombotic action by interfering with platelet aggregation. it alters surface receptors in','6223002570812','',8938,'2025-01-12',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Clopidogrel is a prodrug of a platelet inhibitor used to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke.[A180508,L7213] Clopidogrel is indicated to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction for patients with non-ST elevated acute coronary syndrome (ACS), patients with ST-elevated myocardial infarction, and in recent MI, stroke, or established peripheral arterial disease,[L7213]

Recently a new indication was added to treat symptomatic heart failure from dilated cardiomyopathy for patients 6 months or more in age[Label]. Ivabradine acts by selectively inhibiting the "funny" channel pacemaker current (If) in the sinoatrial node in a dose-dependent fashion, resulting in a lower heart rate and thus more blood to flow to the myocardium. Although non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and beta blockers also effectively lower heart rate, they exhibit adverse events due to their negative ionotropic effects. Therefore, as ivabradine is designed as a "pure" heart rate-lowering drug by selectively acting on the If channels, it may offer a more favorable side effect profile due to its lower likelihood of causing serious adverse effects.','["C01EB17", "C07FX05", "C07FX06"]','[]'),(1692,'Bradoral 0.5mg 20 lozenge','برادورال 0.5مجم 20 قرص','6','','Sore throat','Domiphen','Novartis > glaxo smithkline','Unknown','غير محدد','0.5mg','2','','','6223002640201','',3805,'2022-12-03',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'A01AB06',NULL),(1695,'Brain vita 20 caps.','برين فيتا 20 كبسولة','36','','Multivitamins','Royal jelly+ginseng+ginko biloba','Sabaa > ibn sina','Cap','كبسولة','','2','فيتامينات متعددة -- يحسن الذاكرة -- يزيد من تدفق الدورة الدموية للمخ','','6335014028271','',2721,'2022-12-03',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1696,'Dollar white cream 10% tranexamic acid 60 gm','دولار وايت كريم 10% حمض ترانكساميك 60 جم','350','','Whitening cream','Tranexamic acid+hyaluronic acid+ceramide','Eleganz','Cream','كريم','10%','1','','','','',1439,'2022-09-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL);

The result of doing so allows cGMP present in both the penis and pulmonary vasculature to elicit smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation that subsequently facilitates relief in pulmonary arterial hypertension and the increased flow of blood into the spongy erectile tissue of the penis that consequently allows it to grow in size and become erect and rigid [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

Interestingly enough, it is precisely via this mechanism why sildenafil was at first researched as a potential treatment for angina - or chest pain associated with inadequate blood flow to the heart - before being serendipitously indicated for treating erectile dysfunction in the late 1980s [A175732]. Nevertheless, it is because of this mechanism that sildenafil is also indicated for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension but is also additionally notorious for interacting with various anti-anginal or anti-hypertensive agents to develop potentially rapid, excessive, and/or fatal hypotensive crises [A175579, A175582, A175654].

Regardless, sildenafil, among a variety of other similar or related PDE5 inhibitors, has become a common and effective treatment for erectile dysfunction and since its formal approval for medical use in the public in 1998 [A175732], continues to see millions of prescriptions written for it internationally.

It has also been used as a second-line therapy for unipolar depression when the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is deemed clinically inadequate or inappropriate.[L7375] The potential use of buspirone in combination with [melatonin] in depression and cognitive impairment via promoting neurogenesis has also been investigated.[A181751]','["N05BE01"]','[]'),(1808,'Butacid 10mg 20 tab','بيوتاسيد 10مجم 20 قرص','20','15','Antispasmodic','Hyoscin-n-butylbromid','Cid','Tab','أقراص','10mg','2','علاج آلام الدورة الشهرية -- علاج التشنجات --علاج تقلصات الامعاء','','6221043010465','',3326,'2024-12-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1809,'Butacid 10mg 6supp','بيوتاسيد 10 مجم 6 اقماع','3','','Antispasmodic','Hyoscine-n-butyl bromide','Cid','Supp','لبوس','10mg','1','','','','',848,'2022-09-20',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1810,'Heptacal 20 tabs','هيبتاكال 20 قرص','80','','Calciam magnesiem','Calciam+magneziem+vit d3','HEPTA PHARMA','Tab','أقراص','','1','','','','',968,'2024-12-16',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1812,'Butalin 100mcg/actuation 200 doses','بوتالين بخاخة','12','','Bronchodilator','Salbutamol','Julphar','Unknown','غير محدد','100mcg','1','','about salbutamol beta2-adrenergic agonist phenethylamine derivative bronchodilator(antiasthma) uterine relaxant. mechanism of action of salbutamol salbutamol is a short acting ?2 receptor agonist. it selectively stimulates ?2 receptors present in airway u','6291100083879','',1065,'2022-09-20',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Salbutamol is a short-acting, selective beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist used in the treatment of asthma and COPD. It is 29 times more selective for beta2 receptors than beta1 receptors giving it higher specificity for pulmonary beta receptors versus beta1-adrenergic receptors located in the heart. Salbutamol is formulated as a racemic mixture of the R- and S-isomers. The R-isomer has 150 times greater affinity for the beta2-receptor than the S-isomer and the S-isomer has been associated with toxicity. This lead to the development of levalbuterol, the single R-isomer of salbutamol. However, the high cost of levalbuterol compared to salbutamol has deterred wide-spread use of this enantiomerically pure version of the drug. Salbutamol is generally used for acute episodes of bronchospasm caused by bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis and other chronic bronchopulmonary disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD). It is also used prophylactically for exercise-induced asthma.[Label,A174379,A174400]','["R03AK04", "R03AC02", "R03CC02", "R03AK13", "R03AL02"]','[]'),(1813,'Butaline e.r. 7.5mg 30 caps.','بيوتالين 7.5 مجم 20 كبسول','20','','Bronchodilator.short-acting b2 agonist','Terbutaline','Adwia','Cap','كبسولة','7.5mg','3','','','6291100083879','',918,'2022-12-03',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Terbutaline was first synthesized in 1966[A230333] and described in the literature in the late 1960s and early 1970s.[A230328] It is a selective beta-2 adrenergic agonist used as a bronchodilator in asthmatic patients.[A230333,L32093,L32098]
