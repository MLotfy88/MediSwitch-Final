Close clinical and laboratory monitoring for the development of severe hematologic adverse effects is recommended both during and after discontinuation of therapy. In patients who have previously been treated with immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive drugs, consider potential additive effect, mode of action, and duration of effect of the other drugs prior to initiation of cladribine.

      "effect": "Plasma concentrations of drugs that are CYP450 substrates may decrease following the initiation of interleukin (IL) inhibitors, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers, or interferon (IFN) inhibitors in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases. Because the formation of hepatic CYP450 enzymes is down-regulated during infection and chronic inflammation by increased levels of certain cytokines (e.g., interleukins-1, -6, and -10; tumor necrosis factor alpha; interferons), treatment targeting these cytokines may restore or normalize CYP450 enzyme levels resulting in increased metabolism of these drugs.",
      "management_text": "Caution is advised when treatments targeting cytokines such as interleukins, tumor necrosis factors, or interferons are prescribed to patients receiving concomitant drugs that are CYP450 substrates, particularly those with narrow therapeutic ranges (e.g., antiarrhythmics, anticonvulsants, immunosuppressants, theophylline) or sensitive substrates where decreases in plasma levels may be significant or undesirable (e.g., oral contraceptives, statins, benzodiazepines, opioids). Clinical and/or laboratory monitoring should be considered following the initiation or withdrawal of such treatments, and the dosage(s) of the CYP450 substrate(s) adjusted accordingly. The effects of IL inhibitors, TNF blockers, and IFN inhibitors on CYP450 activities may persist for several weeks after stopping therapy.",

Valbenazine is not recommended for use in patients with congenital long QT syndrome or with arrhythmias associated with a prolonged QT interval. In patients with other risk factors for QT prolongation, the QT interval should be assessed before increasing the dose of valbenazine. The manufacturer recommends that valbenazine dosage be reduced to 40 mg once daily in patients on concomitant therapy with a strong CYP450 3A4 inhibitor (e.g., itraconazole, ketoconazole, clarithromycin). Valbenazine dose reduction should also be considered in patients on concurrent therapy with a strong CYP450 2D6 inhibitor (e.g., paroxetine, fluoxetine, quinidine), or in patients who are poor metabolizers of CYP450 2D6.",
