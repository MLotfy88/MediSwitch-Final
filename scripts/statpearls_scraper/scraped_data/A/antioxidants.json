    "clinical_significance": "The ROS (and by-products) produced from chronic exposure to environmental factors or chronic inflammation would be an ongoing source of DNA alterations giving rise to mutations and increasing cancer risk.\n[15]\nCigarette smoking is a major preventable source of oxidative stress and is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis and cancer, particularly lung cancer. Maternal smoking during pregnancy correlates with many neonatal health problems.\n[16]\nOxygen therapy for premature and/or very low birth weight infants contributes to retinopathy of prematurity.\n[17]\nUpon birth, infants are exposed to higher oxygen levels and accompanying increases in ROS. Premature infants are at increased risk for oxygen toxicity. The retinal microvasculature is initially inhibited then accelerated once supplemental oxygen is removed.\n[17]\nROS production is a risk factor for age-related macular degeneration. The most common type of AMD is dry AMD and treatment consists of close observation with supplementation of antioxidants.\n[18]\nSome of the bacteria that colonize the gastrointestinal tract, primarily the large intestine, can produce an abundance of ROS possibly contributing to colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel diseases.\n[19]\n[20]\nROS also has a role in neurological disease. Point mutations in Cu-Zn/SOD1 are associated with the familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\n[21]\nWhile antioxidants are thought to increase degradation of ROS, an Iowa Women's Health Study found an increased risk of mortality in elderly women who used supplements with antioxidant activity.\n[21]\n[22]\nTherefore, the clinical role of dietary antioxidants or antioxidant supplements in preventing the diseases associated with oxidative stress remains uncertain."
