Methemoglobin concentrations greater than 10% of total hemoglobin will typically cause cyanosis, and levels over 70% are frequently fatal.  However, symptom severity is not always related to methemoglobin levels.  Mild cases often respond to withdrawal of offending agents and symptomatic support.  If a patient does not respond to administration of oxygen, clinically significant or symptomatic methemoglobinemia can be treated with methylene blue 1 to 2 mg/kg by slow intravenous injection over 5 to 10 minutes, which may be repeated within 30 to 60 minutes if necessary.

      "management_text": "Depending on the circumstances, caution may be advisable when topical nitrate and silver preparations are used concomitantly with other methemoglobin-inducing agents.  Clinicians should be aware of the potential for methemoglobinemia, particularly when treating burn patients.  Signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia may be delayed some hours after drug exposure.  Patients or their caregivers should be advised to seek medical attention if they notice signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia such as slate-grey cyanosis in buccal mucous membranes, lips, and nail beds; nausea; headache; dizziness; lightheadedness; lethargy; fatigue; dyspnea; tachypnea; tachycardia; palpitation; anxiety; and confusion.  In severe cases, patients may progress to central nervous system depression, stupor, seizures, acidosis, cardiac arrhythmias, syncope, shock, coma, and death.  Methemoglobinemia should be considered if central cyanosis is unresponsive to oxygen.  Calculated oxygen saturation and pulse oximetry are generally not accurate in the setting of methemoglobinemia.  The diagnosis can be confirmed by an elevated methemoglobin level of at least 10% using co-oximetry.  Methemoglobin concentrations greater than 10% of total hemoglobin will typically cause cyanosis, and levels over 70% are frequently fatal.  However, symptom severity is not always related to methemoglobin levels.  Mild cases often respond to withdrawal of offending agents and symptomatic support.  If patient does not respond to administration of oxygen, clinically significant or symptomatic methemoglobinemia can be treated with methylene blue 1 to 2 mg/kg by slow intravenous injection over 5 to 10 minutes, which may be repeated within 30 to 60 minutes if necessary.  Higher dosages of methylene blue (usually greater than 7 mg/kg) should be avoided, as it can paradoxically exacerbate methemoglobinemia.  Additionally, methylene blue is ineffective and can cause hemolytic anemia in patients with G6PD deficiency.  These patients may be treated with exchange transfusion, dialysis, and/or hyperbaric oxygenation in addition to symptomatic support.",

Because NSAIDs reduce the rate of ulcer healing in the stomach and duodenum, it is also possible that NSAIDs may delay healing and exaggerate the mucosal injury caused by oral bisphosphonates. Theoretical concerns exist regarding the potential for increased risk and severity of renal impairment during coadministration of bisphosphonates with high dosages or chronic use of NSAIDs due to additive or synergistic nephrotoxic effects on the kidney. The use of bisphosphonates has been associated with nephrotoxicity manifested as deterioration of renal function and renal failure. Cases have primarily involved intravenous formulations of the drugs such as pamidronic acid and zoledronic acid, especially when they are administered too rapidly. The risk of hypocalcemia may also be increased, as drug-induced renal tubular damage can lead to renal loss of calcium and other electrolytes such as magnesium. Bisphosphonates alone often cause mild, asymptomatic hypocalcemia via inhibitive effects on bone resorption and possibly chelation of blood calcium. Chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be associated with renal toxicities including elevations in serum creatinine and BUN, tubular necrosis, glomerulitis, renal papillary necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and renal failure.",

Theoretical concerns exist regarding the potential for increased risk and severity of renal impairment during coadministration of bisphosphonates with high dosages or chronic use of NSAIDs due to additive or synergistic nephrotoxic effects on the kidney. The use of bisphosphonates has been associated with nephrotoxicity manifested as deterioration of renal function and renal failure.

The risk of hypocalcemia may also be increased, as drug-induced renal tubular damage can lead to renal loss of calcium and other electrolytes such as magnesium.

Metoprolol may also increase aspirin absorption and/or plasma concentrations of salicylates; however, the clinical significance of this effect is unknown. Data have been conflicting.
