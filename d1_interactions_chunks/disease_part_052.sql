More frequently, asymptomatic abnormal diffusion capacity has been observed.  Patients with preexisting pulmonary dysfunction does not appear to have an increased risk of pulmonary toxicity; however, they have a poorer prognosis if toxicity does develop.  Thus, the risks and benefits of amiodarone therapy should be weighed carefully.  Clinical monitoring of pulmonary function, including chest X-ray (baseline and every 3 to 6 months) and pulmonary function tests (with diffusion capacity), is recommended in all patients receiving amiodarone therapy.  Any new respiratory symptom during treatment should be evaluated promptly and thoroughly, since toxicity is more likely to be reversible if diagnosed and managed early.  Patients who develop hypersensitivity pneumonitis should be withdrawn permanently from amiodarone therapy and treated with steroids.  In the case of interstitial/alveolar pneumonitis, steroid therapy and dosage reduction or discontinuation of amiodarone, if possible, usually result in clinical improvement.  Subsequent rechallenge with amiodarone at reduced dosages does not always lead to return of toxicity and may be considered in some patients.

These reactions are characterized by spastic contraction of discrete muscle groups and may include torticollis, opisthotonos, carpopedal spasm, trismus, difficulty swallowing, perioral spasms with protrusion of the tongue, and oculogyric crisis.  Onset is usually within 24 to 96 hours following initiation of therapy or an increase in dosage.  Risk factors include young age, male gender, use of high-potency agents (e.g., fluphenazine, perphenazine, trifluoperazine), high dosages, and IM administration.  Therapy with phenothiazines should be administered cautiously in patients, particularly children, with hypocalcemia or severe dehydration, since these patients may be more susceptible to dystonic reactions.  Most symptoms subside within a few hours and are almost always reversible within 24 to 48 hours following withdrawal of therapy.  However, severe reactions such as laryngospasm may be life-threatening and require appropriate supportive therapy.

Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac arrhythmias).

Of the phenothiazines used in the treatment of psychosis, chlorpromazine appears to have the greatest epileptogenic potential, while fluphenazine and thioridazine have the least.  Therapy with phenothiazines should be administered cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or other factors predisposing to seizures such as abnormal EEG, preexisting CNS pathology, or head trauma.  Adequate anticonvulsant therapy should be maintained during administration of phenothiazines.', '2', 'Markowitz J, Brown R "Seizures with neuroleptics and antidepressants."

Caution is also advised if NSAIDs are prescribed to patients with other factors that increase risk of GI bleeding, such as:  prolonged NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), anticoagulants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; alcohol use; smoking; history of gastrointestinal surgery or anastomosis, older age; poor general health status; and advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy.

This risk may occur early in treatment and may increase with duration of use.  Clinical trials of several cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to 3 years duration have supported this increased risk.  It is unclear from available data if the risk for cardiovascular thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs.  Therapy with NSAIDs should be administered cautiously in patients with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease.  Patients should be treated with the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration necessary.  Appropriate antiplatelet therapy should be administered to patients requiring cardioprotection; however, there is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events associated with NSAID use, while the risk of serious gastrointestinal events is increased.  Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of adverse cardiovascular events throughout the entire duration of therapy, even without prior cardiovascular symptoms.  Patients should be advised to promptly seek medical attention if they experience symptoms of cardiovascular thrombotic events (including chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, or slurring of speech).NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.  Two large clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke.The use of NSAIDs should be avoided in patients with a recent myocardial infarction unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent cardiovascular thrombotic events.

Imipramine appears to have the greatest propensity to induce these effects, while secondary amines such as nortriptyline may do so less frequently.  Tolerance to the hypotensive effects often develops after a few doses to a few weeks.  Rarely, collapse and sudden death have occurred secondary to severe hypotension.  Other reported adverse cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmias, heart block, hypertension, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, myocardial infarction, strokes, congestive heart failure, and ECG abnormalities such as PR and QT interval prolongation.  Therapy with TCAs should be avoided during the acute recovery phase following myocardial infarction, and should be administered only with extreme caution in patients with hyperthyroidism, a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or a predisposition to hypotension.

ACE inhibitors can also worsen renal function in some patients by blocking the effect of angiotensin II-mediated efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction, thereby decreasing glomerular filtration.  Therapy with ACE inhibitors should be administered cautiously in patients with preexisting renal dysfunction, particularly those with renovascular disease.  Patients with moderate to severe renal impairment usually require lower or less frequent doses and smaller increments in dose.  In addition, a dosage reduction or discontinuation of any concomitantly administered diuretics may be helpful.  Fosinopril probably does not require dosage adjustments unless hepatic function is also significantly impaired.  
In patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney, ACE inhibitors may reduce renal perfusion to a critically low level.
