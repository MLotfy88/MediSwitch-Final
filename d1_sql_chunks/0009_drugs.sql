More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Rosuvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [simvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] This is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than [atorvastatin]''s effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial[A181427] concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.

Rosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]','["C10BX10", "C10BX05", "C10BX07", "C10AA07", "A10BH52", "G01AE10", "C10BX13", "C10BX09", "C10BA09", "C10BX16", "C10BX17", "C10BX14", "C10BA06"]','[]'),(7069,'Lafurex 20mg/2ml 5 amp.','لافيوريكس 20مجم/2مل 5 امبولات','14','','Diuretic.loop','Furosemide','Amoun','Amp','أمبول','20mg','5','','description a benzoic-sulfonamide-furan. it is a diuretic with fast onset and short duration that is used for edema and chronic renal insufficiency. mechanism of action furosemide a loop diuretic inhibits water reabsorption in the nephron by blocking the','','',885,'2022-12-15',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Furosemide is a potent loop diuretic that acts on the kidneys to ultimately increase water loss from the body.

Insulin is typically prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus to mimic the activity of endogenously produced human insulin, a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism. Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Absorption of glucose into cells allows for its transformation into glycogen or fat for storage. Insulin also inhibits hepatic glucose production, enhances protein synthesis, and inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis.

Insulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce or synthesize the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. As a result, people with T1D rely primarily on exogenous forms of insulin, such as insulin glargine, to lower glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is also used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), another form of diabetes mellitus that is a slowly progressing metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors that promote chronically elevated blood sugar levels. Without treatment or improvement in non-pharmacological measures such as diet and exercise to lower blood glucose, high blood sugar eventually causes cellular resistance to endogenous insulin, and in the long term, damage to pancreatic islet cells. Insulin is typically prescribed later in the course of T2D, after several oral medications such as [DB00331], [DB01120], or [DB01261] have been tried, when sufficient damage has been caused to pancreatic cells that the body is no longer able to produce insulin on its own. 

Available as the brand name product Lantus, insulin glargine has a duration of action up to 24 hours allowing for once-daily dosing, typically at bedtime. Due to its duration of action, Lantus is considered "basal insulin" as it provides low concentrations of background insulin that can keep blood sugar stable between meals or overnight. Basal insulin is often combined with short-acting "bolus insulin" such as [DB00046], [DB01309], and [DB01306] to provide higher doses of insulin that are required following meals. Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas'' production of endogenous insulin, with a goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia. 

Insulin glargine is also available as the biosimilar, or "follow-on" product, Basaglar in the US and as Abasaglar in the EU. As of 2015, insulin glargine was reformulated by Sanofi as the product Toujeo in an extra-concentrated form containing 300IU/mL (compared to 100IU/mL contained in Lantus). Use of the higher concentrated Toujeo as compared to Lantus results in slightly different pharmacokinetics, with a later onset (up to 6 hours) and duration of action (up to 30 hours). In 2021, another biosimilar, Semglee (insulin glargine-yfgn),[L34959] became the first interchangeable (with Lantus) biosimilar insulin to receive FDA approval.[L34964]

Insulin glargine is produced by recombinant DNA technology using a non-pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli (K12) as the production organism. Insulin glargine differs from endogenous human insulin by the replacement of an asparagine residue at position A21 of the A-chain with glycine and addition of two arginines to the C-terminus (positions B31 and 32) of the B-chain. The resulting protein is soluble at pH 4 and forms microprecipitates at physiological pH 7.4 allowing for the slow release of small amounts of insulin glargine, giving the drug a long duration of action and no pronounced peak concentration.

Without an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst. If left untreated, the body starts to break down fat, instead of glucose, for energy which results in a build-up of ketone acids in the blood and a syndrome called ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. In the long term, elevated blood sugar levels increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetic neuropathy.','["A10AE54", "A10AE04"]','[]'),(7101,'Lantus solostar 100 i.u./ml 5 pens','لانتوس سولو ستار 100وحدة دولية/مل 5 اقلام','1,244','870','Anti-diabetic.insulin analouge','Insulin glargine','Sanofi','Pen','قلم','','5','','insulin glargine about insulin glargine pancreatic hormone a long-acting basal insulin analogue antidiabetic agent. mechanism of action of insulin glargine it is a long acting insulin used for the control of hyperglycaemia. insulin acts through binding to','3582910013204','540879',28251,'2024-10-16',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Insulin glargine is a long-acting form of insulin used for the treatment of hyperglycemia caused by Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes.

Aaron B. Lerner of Yale University is credited for naming the hormone and for defining its chemical structure in 1958.  In mammals, melatonin is produced by the pineal gland. The pineal gland is small endocrine gland, about the size of a rice grain and shaped like a pine cone (hence the name), that is located in the center of the brain (rostro-dorsal to the superior colliculus) but outside the blood-brain barrier. The secretion of melatonin increases in darkness and decreases during exposure to light, thereby regulating the circadian rhythms of several biological functions, including the sleep-wake cycle. In particular, melatonin regulates the sleep-wake cycle by chemically causing drowsiness and lowering the body temperature.  Melatonin is also implicated in the regulation of mood, learning and memory, immune activity, dreaming, fertility and reproduction. Melatonin is also an effective antioxidant.  Most of the actions of melatonin are mediated through the binding and activation of melatonin receptors. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may have lower than normal levels of melatonin. A 2008 study found that unaffected parents of individuals with ASD also have lower melatonin levels, and that the deficits were associated with low activity of the ASMT gene, which encodes the last enzyme of melatonin synthesis.

Insulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce or synthesize the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels.[A2358, A2359, A2360, A44] As a result, people with T1D rely primarily on exogenous forms of insulin, such as insulin detemir, to lower glucose levels in the blood.[A2358, A2359, A2360, A44] Insulin is also used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), another form of diabetes mellitus that is a slowly progressing metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors that promote chronically elevated blood sugar levels.[A2358, A2359, A2360, A44] Without treatment or improvement in non-pharmacological measures such as diet and exercise to lower blood glucose, high blood sugar eventually causes cellular resistance to endogenous insulin, and in the long term, damage to pancreatic islet cells.[A2358, A2359, A2360, A44] Insulin is typically prescribed later in the course of T2D, after several oral medications such as [DB00331], [DB01120], or [DB01261] have been tried, when sufficient damage has been caused to pancreatic cells that the body is no longer able to produce insulin on its own.[A2358, A2359, A2360, A44] 

Marketed as the brand name product Levemir, insulin detemir has a duration of action of 16-24 hours allowing for once-daily dosing, typically at bedtime.[A2358, A2359, A2360, A44] Due to its duration of action, Levemir is considered "basal insulin" as it provides low concentrations of background insulin that can keep blood sugar stable between meals or overnight.[A2358, A2359, A2360, A44] Basal insulin is often combined with short-acting "bolus insulin" such as [DB00046], [DB01309], and [DB01306] to provide higher doses of insulin required following meals.[A2358, A2359, A2360, A44] Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas'' production of endogenous insulin, with a goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia.[A2358, A2359, A2360, A44]

Insulin detemir is produced using recombinant DNA technology in yeast cells.[A2358, A2359, A2360, A44] This insulin analogue has a 14-C fatty acid, myristic acid, bound to the lysine amino acid at position B29. The myristoyl side chain increases self-association and albumin binding.[A2358, A2359, A2360, A44] This along with slow systemic absorption from the injection site prolongs distribution of the hormone into tissues and results in a long duration of action. [A2358, A2359, A2360, A44]

Without an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst.[A2358, A2359, A2360, A44] If left untreated, the body starts to break down fat, instead of glucose, for energy which results in a build-up of ketone acids in the blood and a syndrome called ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. In the long term, elevated blood sugar levels increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetic neuropathy.[A2358, A2359, A2360, A44]','["A10AE05"]','[]'),(7246,'levepex 1000 mg 30 f.c. tab.','ليفيبكس 1000مجم 30 قرص','288','216','Anti-epileptic.pyrrolidine','levetiracetam','multi-apex','tablet','أقراص','1000 mg','3','','about levetiracetam it is s-enantiomer of etiracetam. anticonvulsant medication used to treat epilepsy. mechanism of action of levetiracetam the exact mechanism for levetiracetam is unknown. however the drug binds to a synaptic vesicle protein sv2a which ','6223003204146','',2002,'2025-12-17',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Levetiracetam is a drug within the pyrrolidine class that is used to treat various types of seizures stemming from epileptic disorders.

It is a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). Penile erection is a hemodynamic process initiated by the relaxation of smooth muscle in the corpus cavernosum and its associated arterioles. During sexual stimulation, nitric oxide is released from nerve endings and endothelial cells in the corpus cavernosum. Nitric oxide activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase resulting in increased synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the smooth muscle cells of the corpus cavernosum. The cGMP in turn triggers smooth muscle relaxation, allowing increased blood flow into the penis, resulting in erection. The tissue concentration of cGMP is regulated by both the rates of synthesis and degradation via phosphodiesterases (PDEs). The most abundant PDE in the human corpus cavernosum is the cGMPspecific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5); therefore, the inhibition of PDE5 enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP.','["G04BE09"]','[]'),(7256,'Levocar 250/25 mg 30 tab','ليفوكار 250/25 مجم 30 قرص','129','94.5','Parkinson s disease.dopamine agonist','Carbidopa+levodopa','Alfacure pharmaceuticals','Tab','أقراص','25 mg','3','الشلل الرعاش','','6224007711132','',4087,'2024-06-27',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(7258,'Novisin 20 ec tabs','نوفيزين 20 قرص','150','','Anti inflammatory','Trypsin+rutin+bromelain','Novira pharma','Tab','أقراص','','2','','','','',1103,'2025-08-31',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(7261,'Levoctivan 5mg 30 f.c. tab.','ليفوكتيفان 5مجم 30 قرص','69','43.5','Antihistamine.non-sedative.third-generation','Levocetirizine','Egpi > glenmark pharmaceuticals','Tab','أقراص','5mg','3','مضاد للحساسية','about levocetirizine a third-generation non-sedative h1 antagonist antihistamine. mechanism of action of levocetirizine this active enantiomer of cetrizine is a potent nonsedative and selective h1 receptor antagonist. it antagonizes the allergic symptoms','6224000889029','',6027,'2024-07-25',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Levocetirizine is a selective histamine H1antagonist used to treat a variety of allergic symptoms.[A181748,A181790,L7694] It is the R enantiomer of [cetirizine].[L7694] Levocetirizine has greater affinity for the histamine H1receptor than cetirizine.[L7694]

Dexlansoprazole is the R-enantiomer of [DB00448], which is composed of a racemic mixture of the R- and S-enantiomers. Compared to the older generation of PPIs (which includes [DB00213], [DB00338], and [DB00448]) [A178084], dexlansoprazole MR has a unique pharmacokinetic profile due to its delayed-release and dual-delivery release system. The active ingredient is released in two phases at different pH values and at different time points, resulting in two peak concentrations in the blood; 25% of the dose is released at pH 5.5 in the proximal duodenum, while the remaining 75% is released at pH 6.75 in the distal small intestine [A19567]. As a result, dexlansoprazole has a peak concentration within 1-2 hours after dosing and another within 4-5 hours [FDA Label]. Dexlansoprazole''s unique pharmacokinetics addresses limitations of the older generation PPIs including short plasma half-life, break-through symptoms, and need for meal-associated dosing [A19568]. These characteristics make dexlansoprazole a good option for people who struggle with adherence and strict dosage timing before meals[A178087, A19566]. 

Dexlansoprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects in the same way as other drugs in the PPI family by inhibiting the final step in gastric acid production. Dexlansoprazole targets the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme, which is involved in the secretion of hydrochloric acid through the exchange of H+ ions from the cytoplasm for K+ ions. Normally functioning (H+, K+)-ATPase stimulates hydrochloric acid secretion into the gastric lumen thereby increasing stomach acidity and lowering pH. Once absorbed into circulation, dexlansoprazole covalently binds to the sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells, which leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion. Despite dexlansoprazole''s unique pharmacokinetic profile, efficacy in management of GERD symptoms is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [DB00338], [DB00736], [DB00448], [DB00213], and [DB01129].

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as dexlansoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life [A177571]. PPIs such as dexlansoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes [A177577, A177580]. 

Dexlansoprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing as rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as dexlansoprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion [A177574].','["A02BC06"]','[]'),(7275,'Levoxin 500mg 5 f.c. tab.','ليفوكسين 500 مجم 5 اقراص','76','','Antibiotic.quinolone','Levofloxacin','Amoun','Tab','أقراص','500mg','1','مضاد حيوي','','6221025011824','',4048,'2022-12-06',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic and the optical S-(-) isomer of racemic [ofloxacin].[A190663] It reportedly carries 8 to 128-fold more activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria compared to R-(+)-ofloxacin[A190663] and remains stereochemically stable following administration (i.e. it does not invert to the inactive isomer).[L11638] Levofloxacin, along with other quinolones such as [gatifloxacin] and [moxifloxacin], is a member of the third generation of fluoroquinolones, colloquially referred to as the "respiratory quinolones" due to improved activity against gram-positive bacteria commonly implicated in respiratory infections.[A31453,A190756]

It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infections along with other antibiotics including [DB01060], [DB01211], and [DB00916], for example.[A177271, F4498] Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [DB00338], [DB00213], [DB00448], [DB05351], and [DB01129]. Esomeprazole is the s-isomer of [DB00338], which is a racemate of the S- and R-enantiomer. Esomeprazole has been shown to inhibit acid secretion to a similar extent as [DB00338], without any significant differences between the two compounds _in vitro_. 

Esomeprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of esomeprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, esomeprazole''s duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]

PPIs such as esomeprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as esomeprazole has been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients such as iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]

Rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as esomeprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion.[A177574] Esomeprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing to prevent this rebound effect.','["A02BD06", "A02BC05", "M01AE52"]','[]'),(7316,'Predabure 600 20 caps','بريدابور 600 - 20 كبسولة','295','','Multivitamin','Alpha lipoic acid+benfotiamine+vitamin b6+b12 & d3','Prevacure pharma','Cap','كبسولة','','2','','','','',1375,'2025-09-01',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL);

NSAIDs consist of agents that are structurally unrelated; the NSAID chemical classification of indometacin is an indole-acetic acid derivative with the chemical name 1- (p-chlorobenzoyl)25-methoxy-2-methylindole-3-acetic acid.[A177871] The pharmacological effect of indometacin is not fully understood, however, it is thought to be mediated through potent and nonselective inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), which is the main enzyme responsible for catalyzes the rate-limiting step in prostaglandin and thromboxane biosynthesis via the arachidonic acid (AA) pathway. Indometacin was first discovered in 1963 and it was first approved for use in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration in 1965, [A486] along with other acetic acid derivatives such as [diclofenac] and [sulindac] that were also developed during the 1960s.[A177871] Since then, indometacin has been extensively studied in clinical trials as one of the most potent NSAIDs in blocking prostaglandin synthesis and was among the first NSAIDs to be used in the symptomatic treatment of migraine and for headaches that eventually became known as “indomethacin-responsive” headache disorders.[A177871] 

Most commonly used in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritis, acute shoulder pains, and acute gouty arthritis, indometacin is currently available as oral capsules as well as other methods of administration, including rectal and intravenous formulations. Intravenous indometacin is administered to close a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus, as indicated by clinical evidence, in premature infants.[L10553] Ophthalmic indometacin has been studied and used in the symptomatic treatment of postoperative ocular inflammation and pain and/or complications after cataract surgery. Although deemed effective in reducing ocular inflammation in clinical studies, topical NSAIDs were also associated with a potential reduction in corneal sensitivity accompanied by an increased risk of superficial punctate keratitis and subjective symptoms of discomfort, including pain, burning or pricking, or a tingling sensation after instillation into the cul‐de‐sac.[A177949]','["S01CC02", "M01AB51", "S01BC01", "M02AA23", "M01AB01", "C01EB03"]','[]'),(7336,'Kidi marcal syrup 120 ml','كيدي ماركال شراب 120 مل','90','','','','','Syrup','شراب','120 ml','1','','','','',960,'2022-12-06',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(7338,'Lipanthyl 300mg 30 capsules','ليبانتيل 300 مجم 30 كبسولة','126','96','Antihyperlipidemic.fibrates','Fenofibrate','Mina pharm','Capsule','كبسولة','300mg','3','خافض للكوليسترول والدهون في الدم','','6222003701942','',13132,'2024-07-24',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Fenofibrate is a fibric acid derivative like [clofibrate] and [gemfibrozil].[A185954] Fenofibrate is used to treat primary hypercholesterolemia, mixed dyslipidemia, severe hypertriglyceridemia.[L8588,L8591]

Structurally, ergocalciferol differs from cholecalciferol in that it possesses a double bond between C22 and C23 and has an additional methyl group at C24 [L5689]. Finally, ergocalciferol is pharmacologically less potent than cholecalciferol, which makes vitamin D3 the preferred agent for medical use [L5689].

Appropriate levels of vitamin D must be upheld in the body in order to maintain calcium and phosphorus levels in a healthy physiologic range to sustain a variety of metabolic functions, transcription regulation, and bone metabolism [A223, L5689, L1782, L5771, F4027, F4042, F4048].

By inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver, statins lower abnormal cholesterol and lipid levels, and ultimately reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid. This conversion is a critical metabolic reaction involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport, including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing statins is considered standard practice for patients following any cardiovascular event, and for people who are at moderate to high risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The evidence supporting statin use, coupled with minimal side effects and long term benefits, has resulted in wide use of this medication in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Atorvastatin and other statins including [lovastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [simvastatin] are considered first-line treatment options for dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] The increasing use of this class of drugs is largely attributed to the rise in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (such as heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke) in many countries.[A181084] An elevated cholesterol level (elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in particular) is a significant risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Several landmark studies demonstrate that the use of statins is associated with both a reduction in LDL levels and CVD risk.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins were shown to reduce the incidences of all-cause mortality, including fatal and non-fatal CVD, as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Some evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within five years) statin use leads to a 20%-22% relative reduction in the number of major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

Structurally, ergocalciferol differs from cholecalciferol in that it possesses a double bond between C22 and C23 and has an additional methyl group at C24 [L5689]. Finally, ergocalciferol is pharmacologically less potent than cholecalciferol, which makes vitamin D3 the preferred agent for medical use [L5689].

Appropriate levels of vitamin D must be upheld in the body in order to maintain calcium and phosphorus levels in a healthy physiologic range to sustain a variety of metabolic functions, transcription regulation, and bone metabolism [A223, L5689, L1782, L5771, F4027, F4042, F4048].

More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Rosuvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [simvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] This is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than [atorvastatin]''s effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial[A181427] concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.

Rosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]','["C10BX10", "C10BX05", "C10BX07", "C10AA07", "A10BH52", "G01AE10", "C10BX13", "C10BX09", "C10BA09", "C10BX16", "C10BX17", "C10BX14", "C10BA06"]','[]'),(7473,'Joint pex 30 tab','جوينت بكس 30 قرص','320','','Multivitamin','Hyaluronic+glucosamine+chondroitin+vit b12+vit c','Pex pharma','Tab','أقراص','','3','','','','',948,'2025-09-21',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(7477,'Synapse ivy 120ml syurp','سينابس ايفي شراب 120 مل','55','','Anti&cough antitussive and expectorant','Ivy leaf extract 43 mg/5ml','Synapse pharm','Unknown','غير محدد','120ml','1','','','','',906,'2022-12-06',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(7479,'Locasten 1% cream 20 gm','لوكاستن كريم 20 جرام','29','19','Antifungals.imidazoles','Clotrimazole','Alexandria','Cream','كريم','1%','1','مضاد فطريات','how does it work? clotrimazole cream 1% contains the active ingredient clotrimazole which is an antifungal medicine used to treat infections with fungi and yeasts. mechanism: clotrimazole kills fungi and yeasts by interfering with their cell membranes. it','6223000173169','',3335,'2024-10-09',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'This drug is a broad spectrum antimycotic or antifungal agent.

During sexual stimulation, nitric oxide is released from nerve endings and endothelial cells in the corpus cavernosum.

The cGMP in turn triggers smooth muscle relaxation, allowing increased blood flow into the penis, resulting in erection. The tissue concentration of cGMP is regulated by both the rates of synthesis and degradation via phosphodiesterases (PDEs).

Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Lovastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [simvastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] Increasing use of the statin class of drugs is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, [rosuvastatin] is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg [rosuvastatin] per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels, while lovastatin has been found to have an average decrease in LDL-C of 25-40%.[A174580,A181409,A181535,A181538,A1793] Potency is thought to correlate to tissue permeability as the more lipophilic statins such as lovastatin are thought to enter endothelial cells by passive diffusion, as opposed to hydrophilic statins such as [pravastatin] and [rosuvastatin] which are taken up into hepatocytes through OATP1B1 (organic anion transporter protein 1B1)-mediated transport.[A181424,A181460] Despite these differences in potency, several trials have demonstrated only minimal differences in terms of clinical outcomes between statins.[A181538, A181427]','["C10AA02", "C10BA01"]','[]'),(7569,'Miss white 60 gm cream','ميس وايت كريم 60 جم','165','','Skin cream','Alpha arbutin+vit c+liquorice ext+hyaluronic acid+collagen','Miss white','Cream','كريم','60 gm','1','','','','',789,'2024-08-05',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(7570,'Modrical 30 f.c. tabs.','مودريكال 30 قرص','130','','Calcium supplement with vitamins','Calcium+magnesium+vitamin d3+zinc','Organix pharma','Tab','أقراص','','3','','','','',890,'2025-10-01',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(7571,'Moveasy 10 mg 30 f.c.tabs.','موفيزي 10مجم 30 قرص','69','','Cns.analgesic.skeletal muscle relaxant','Cyclobenzaprine','Global napi pharmaceuticals','Tab','أقراص','10 mg','3','','','6223002146727','',1130,'2023-05-01',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Cyclobenzaprine, a centrally-acting muscle relaxant, was first synthesized in 1961[A185039] and has been available for human use since 1977.[A184982] It was initially studied for use as antidepressant given its structural similarity to tricyclic antidepressants - it differs from [Amitriptyline] by only a single double bond.[A185039,A184982] Since its approval, it has remained relatively popular as an adjunctive, short-term treatment for acute skeletal muscle spasms secondary to musculoskeletal injury.','["M03BX08"]','[]'),(7572,'Lovegra 100mg tab','لوفيجرا 100مجم قرص','9','','Tonic for men','Sildenafil','Sini pharma','Tab','أقراص','100mg','1','مقوي للرجال','','','',2386,'2023-05-12',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'In eliciting its mechanism of action, sildenafil ultimately prevents or minimizes the breakdown of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) by inhibiting cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

It is primarily used for the treatment of respiratory, enteric and genitourinary infections and may be used instead of other macrolides for some sexually transmitted and enteric infections. It is structurally related to erythromycin [A174169].

Azithromycin [9-deoxo-9a-aza-9a-methyl-9a-homoerythromycin] is a part of the _azalide_ subclass of macrolides, and contains a 15-membered ring, with a methyl-substituted nitrogen instead of a carbonyl group at the 9a position on the aglycone ring, which allows for the prevention of its metabolism. This differentiates azithromycin from other types of macrolides [A174175].

In March 2020, a small study was funded by the French government to investigate the treatment of COVID-19 with a combination of azithromycin and the anti-malaria drug [hydroxychloroquine].

Sertraline displays enhanced safety or tolerability than other classes of antidepressants, which frequently cause high levels of drowsiness, dizziness, blurred vision, and other undesirable effects.[A1846,A187075,T28]','["N06AB06"]','[]'),(7616,'Vigilant anti grey hair','فيجيلانت انتي جراي هير','600','','Anti grey hair serum','Darkenyl+melanogray+niacinamide','Levisage pharma','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',708,'2025-10-06',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(7617,'Civelle oleo moisturizing cream','سيفيل اوليو كريم مرطب','180','','Moisturizing cream','Aqua+monolaurin+glycerin+squalane+allantoin+centella asiatica extract+niacinamide+propylene glycol+chamomile extract+urea+panthenol+lactic acid+zinc pca+oleanolic acid+zinc gluconate+magnesium aspartate+tocopherol+trifolium extract.','Kamma pharma','Cream','كريم','','1','','','','',633,'2025-10-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(7618,'Lutofolone 2 amp.','لوتوفولون 2 امبولة','40','20','Gyna','Estradiol+progesterone','Misr','Amp','أمبول','','2','','indication for the treatment of urogenital symptoms associated with post-menopausal atrophy of the vagina (such as dryness burning pruritus and dyspareunia) and/or the lower urinary tract (urinary urgency and dysuria). mechanism of action estradiol enters','6221035016109','',6831,'2024-11-09',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(7619,'Civelle deo plus deodorant 60 ml','سيفيل ديو بلس مزيل عرق 60 مل','250','','Deodorant','Alum rock+bisabolol+lactic acid+allantoin+chitosan+chlorhexidine+titanium dioxide+zinc oxide+lumiskin+magnesium ascorbyl phosphate+glycyrrhiza glabra root extract+licorice extract+zinc gluconate+magnesium gluconate+propylene glycol+parfum+aqua','Kamma pharma','Unknown','غير محدد','60 ml','1','','','','',744,'2025-10-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(7621,'Civelle oleo facial cleanser 150 ml','سيفيل اوليو منظف للوجه 150 مل','250','','Facial cleanser','Sodium cocoamphoacetate+sodium laureth sulfate+monolaurin+zinc pca+butyl avocadate+hyaluronic acid+salicylic acid+lactic acid+niacinamide+zinc gluconate+piroctone olamine+copper pca+ginkgo biloba leaf extract+glycerin+boswellia sacra gum/resin extract+aqua+xanthan gum+lauryl glucosdie+citri acid+iodopropynyl butylcarbamate+phenoxyethanol+parfum','Kamma pharma','Cleanser','منظف','150 ml','1','','','','',683,'2022-08-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(7622,'Topaflix massage gel 50 gm','توبافليكس مساج جل 50 جم','80','','Massage gel','Menthol+eucalyptus globulus leaf oil+cinnamomum camphora oil+carbomer+triethanolamin+eugenia caryophyllus bud oil+tocopherol+aesculus hippocastanum seed extract+ginkgo biloba leaf extract+thymus vulgaris leaf oil+glycerin+lavandula angustifolia oil+chamomilla recutita flower oil+dimethicone+phenoxyethanol+parfum+aqua','Kamma pharma','Gel','جل','50 gm','1','','','','',589,'2025-10-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(7623,'Black seed vit syrup 125 ml','بلاك سيد فيت شراب 125 مل','241','','Dietary supplement','Black seed oil+vitamin e+olive oil+honey','Egy seven','Syrup','شراب','125 ml','1','','','','',737,'2025-10-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(7625,'Lyribalin 150mg 10 caps.','ليريبالين 150مجم 10كبسول','23','','Anti-epileptic.gaba analogs','Pregabalin','Borg','Cap','كبسولة','150mg','1','','about pregabalin a gaba agonist anticonvulsant. mechanism of action of pregabalin pregabalin is a gaba neurotransmitter analog. it produces its action by modulating calcium channels and also reduces the release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate norep','','',997,'2022-08-02',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Pregabalin is structurally similar to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) - an inhibitory neurotransmitter.[A173995] It may be used to manage neuropathic pain, postherpetic neuralgia, and fibromyalgia among other conditions.[A187190] Although as per the FDA Label the mechanism of action has not been definitively defined, there is evidence that pregabalin exerts its effects by binding to the α2δ subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels.[A187190][L7066] Pregabalin is marketed by Pfizer under the trade name Lyrica and Lyrica Cr (extended release).[L1006][L7066] It may have dependence liability if misused but the risk appears to be highest in patients with current or past substance use disorders.[A31161]','["N03AX16"]','[]'),(7626,'Indomethacin ait topical aerosol solution 120 ml','اندوميثاسين ايه آي تي سبراي 120 مل','46','','','Indomethacin','Ait','Solution','محلول','120 ml','1','','','6224000588847','',914,'2025-10-09',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Indometacin, or indomethacin, is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic properties. NSAIDs consist of agents that are structurally unrelated; the NSAID chemical classification of indometacin is an indole-acetic acid derivative with the chemical name 1- (p-chlorobenzoyl)25-methoxy-2-methylindole-3-acetic acid.[A177871] The pharmacological effect of indometacin is not fully understood, however, it is thought to be mediated through potent and nonselective inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), which is the main enzyme responsible for catalyzes the rate-limiting step in prostaglandin and thromboxane biosynthesis via the arachidonic acid (AA) pathway. Indometacin was first discovered in 1963 and it was first approved for use in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration in 1965, [A486] along with other acetic acid derivatives such as [diclofenac] and [sulindac] that were also developed during the 1960s.[A177871] Since then, indometacin has been extensively studied in clinical trials as one of the most potent NSAIDs in blocking prostaglandin synthesis and was among the first NSAIDs to be used in the symptomatic treatment of migraine and for headaches that eventually became known as “indomethacin-responsive” headache disorders.[A177871] 

Most commonly used in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritis, acute shoulder pains, and acute gouty arthritis, indometacin is currently available as oral capsules as well as other methods of administration, including rectal and intravenous formulations. Intravenous indometacin is administered to close a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus, as indicated by clinical evidence, in premature infants.[L10553] Ophthalmic indometacin has been studied and used in the symptomatic treatment of postoperative ocular inflammation and pain and/or complications after cataract surgery. Although deemed effective in reducing ocular inflammation in clinical studies, topical NSAIDs were also associated with a potential reduction in corneal sensitivity accompanied by an increased risk of superficial punctate keratitis and subjective symptoms of discomfort, including pain, burning or pricking, or a tingling sensation after instillation into the cul‐de‐sac.[A177949]','["S01CC02", "M01AB51", "S01BC01", "M02AA23", "M01AB01", "C01EB03"]','[]'),(7627,'Omegahal syr','اوميجاهال شراب','250','','Omega 3','Fish oil+folic acid+ascorbic acid','Yojeen','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',838,'2022-11-30',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(7628,'Lyrica 50mg 20 caps','ليريكا 50مجم 20 كبسولة','210','126','Anti-epileptic.gaba analogs','Pregabalin','Pfizer','Cap','كبسولة','50mg','2','','about pregabalin a gaba agonist anticonvulsant. mechanism of action of pregabalin pregabalin is a gaba neurotransmitter analog. it produces its action by modulating calcium channels and also reduces the release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate norep','','',1719,'2024-11-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Pregabalin is structurally similar to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) - an inhibitory neurotransmitter.[A173995] It may be used to manage neuropathic pain, postherpetic neuralgia, and fibromyalgia among other conditions.[A187190] Although as per the FDA Label the mechanism of action has not been definitively defined, there is evidence that pregabalin exerts its effects by binding to the α2δ subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels.[A187190][L7066] Pregabalin is marketed by Pfizer under the trade name Lyrica and Lyrica Cr (extended release).[L1006][L7066] It may have dependence liability if misused but the risk appears to be highest in patients with current or past substance use disorders.[A31161]','["N03AX16"]','[]'),(7629,'Relanono','ريلانونو شراب','49','','Multivitamin','Ginger extract+fennel seed extract','Yojeen','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',854,'2022-11-30',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL);

It is primarily used for the treatment of respiratory, enteric and genitourinary infections and may be used instead of other macrolides for some sexually transmitted and enteric infections. It is structurally related to erythromycin [A174169].

Azithromycin [9-deoxo-9a-aza-9a-methyl-9a-homoerythromycin] is a part of the _azalide_ subclass of macrolides, and contains a 15-membered ring, with a methyl-substituted nitrogen instead of a carbonyl group at the 9a position on the aglycone ring, which allows for the prevention of its metabolism. This differentiates azithromycin from other types of macrolides [A174175].

In March 2020, a small study was funded by the French government to investigate the treatment of COVID-19 with a combination of azithromycin and the anti-malaria drug [hydroxychloroquine]. The results were positive, all patients taking the combination were virologically cured within 6 days of treatment, however, larger studies are required.[A192546]','["J01RA07", "S01AA26", "J01FA10"]','[]'),(7641,'Msm 1000 mg 30 tabs','ام.اس.ام 100 مجم 30 قرص','23','','Joints care','Methyl sulphonyl methane','Eva pharma','Tab','أقراص','1000 mg','1','يستخدم في حالات التهاب المفاصل','','6224009763146','',7813,'2023-02-19',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(7642,'Healzavite 30 tabs','هيلزافيت 30 قرص','150','','Anti oxidants, multi vitamins and minerals','Lutein+lycopene+zeaxanthin+biotin+selenium+vitamin a+vitamin c+vitamin e+zinc+copper+ca+phosphorus+vitamin d3+vitamin k2+mg+full vitamin b complex (b1+b2+b3+b5+b6+b7+b9 folic acid+b12','Healza pharma','Tab','أقراص','','3','','','','',827,'2025-10-09',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(7643,'Speconditional 30 subligual tabs','سبيكونديشنال 30 قرص تحت اللسان','120','','Support nervous system health','Folic acid+vitamin b6+vitamin b12','','Tab','أقراص','','3','','','6224009555178','',884,'2025-10-11',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(7645,'Bobai sunscreen oil defense fluid spf+50 lotion 75 ml','بوباي صنسكرين اويل ديفنس فلويد لوشن 75 مل','360','','','','Parkville','Lotion','لوشن','75 ml','1','','','6224010337954','',721,'2025-10-13',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(7646,'Maalox plus (lemon flavoured) oral susp. 250 ml','مالوكس بلس نكهة ليمون معلق 250 مل','143','100','Antacid','Aluminium hydroxide+magnesium hydroxide+simethicone','Sanofi','Susp','معلق','250 ml','1','الحموضة - حرقان الصدر','mechanism of action aluminum hydroxide: neutralizes stomach hydrocloride to form alcl3 salt plus water; increases gastric ph magnesium hydroxide: promotes bowel evacuation by causing osmotic retention of fluid which causes the colon to distend with increa','3582910089704','',10284,'2025-09-01',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(7647,'Viliglap 50mg 10 tabs','فيليجلاب 50 مجم 10 اقراص','36','','','Vildagliptin','Wnb','Tab','أقراص','50mg','1','','','6224009259366','',752,'2025-10-13',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'A10BH02',NULL),(7648,'Maalox plus 200/200/25mg 40 chewable tab.','مالوكس بلس اقراص مضغ 40 قرص','41','','Antacid','Aluminium hydroxide+magnesium hydroxide+simethicone','Sanofi','Tab','أقراص','25mg','4','','mechanism of action aluminum hydroxide: neutralizes stomach hydrocloride to form alcl3 salt plus water; increases gastric ph magnesium hydroxide: promotes bowel evacuation by causing osmotic retention of fluid which causes the colon to distend with increa','3582910065197','',1523,'2022-12-06',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(7649,'Maalox plus (lemon flavoured) oral susp. 180 ml','مالوكس بلس معلق 180 مل','76','49','Antacid','Aluminium hydroxide+magnesium hydroxide+simethicone','Sanofi','Susp','معلق','180 ml','1','','','6223003992088','',2666,'2024-10-23',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(7650,'Maalox 20 oral sachet susp.','مالوكس للمعدة 20 كيس','120','70','Antacid','Aluminium oxide+magnesium hydroxide','A.nattermann & cie gmbh-germany > sanofi','Susp','معلق','','20','','available in 2 flavours: lemon red fruits','3664798001105','',4151,'2024-10-21',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'D10AX04',NULL),(7652,'Mabelle cream 60gm','مابيل كريم 60 جم','23','','Moisturizing topical','Mineral oil+caster oil+paraffin oil+stearic acid+wheat germ oil+bees wax+sodium hydroxide+vitamin e','Tadawi egypt','Cream','كريم','60gm','1','كريم مرطب للجلد -- يستحدم في حالات الجفاف الجلدي -- يساعد علي اعادة ترطيب وتنعيم وتفتيح الجلد','','6221039305278','',1057,'2022-04-09',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(7653,'Macrodantin 50 mg 30 cap','ماكرودانتين 50 مجم 30 كبسولة','8','','Urinary tract infection','Nitrofurantoin','Almatica','Cap','كبسولة','50 mg','3','علاج التهابات مجري البول __ يقلل الالام و الالتهابات أثناء التبول __ يعمل علي عدم تكوين حصاوي','','','',2342,'2022-04-18',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Nitrofurantoin is a nitrofuran antibiotic used to treat uncomplicated urinary tract infections.[L6856,L6859,L6862] Nitrofurantoin is converted by bacterial nitroreductases to electrophilic intermediates which inhibit the citric acid cycle as well as synthesis of DNA, RNA, and protein.[A179824] This drug is more resistant to the development of bacterial resistance because it acts on many targets at once.[A179824] Nitrofurantoin is a second line treatment to [trimethoprim]/[sulfamethoxazole].[A179830]

Additional adverse effects such as necrosis, purple toe syndrome, osteoporosis, valve and artery calcification, and drug interactions have also been documented with warfarin use.
