    "toxicity": "Although there is no evidence of toxic levels for consuming niacin through foods, niacin consumption in heavily fortified foods, pharmacological or supplemental levels can result in adverse events. High levels of niacin (3000 mg/day) may cause flushing, jaundice, impaired vision, and abdominal discomfort, and a sustained high level can cause hepatotoxicity.\n[40]\nThe tolerable upper intake level of 35 mg/day of niacin in adults 19 or older may cause adverse effects.\n[38]"
