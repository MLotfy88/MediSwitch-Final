Fatal hyperpyrexia and hypertension have also been observed in animal studies with meperidine and phenelzine or furazolidone.

Fatal hyperpyrexia and hypertension have also been observed in animal studies with meperidine and phenelzine or furazolidone.

The exact mechanism of interaction is unknown, but may involve excessive serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (i.e., serotonin syndrome). The interaction is unpredictable and has been reported primarily with meperidine or fentanyl and various MAOIs including phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid, moclobemide, and selegiline. Fatal hyperpyrexia and hypertension have also been observed in animal studies with meperidine and phenelzine or furazolidone.
