    "indications": "Around the world, theophylline (1,3-dimethylxanthine) is primarily used as a bronchodilator for patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, in the United States, asthma and COPD are mainly treated with other agents, and theophylline is largely used to treat bradycardia and apnea in premature newborns. Theophylline causes the endogenous release of catecholamines through indirect stimulation of beta-1 and beta-2 receptors, which at therapeutic levels cause desired bronchodilation. Unfortunately, theophylline has a narrow therapeutic window, and even levels slightly above this therapeutic window can have many adverse effects in the setting of acute and chronic toxicity. The excess circulating catecholamines cause serious clinical effects that are associated with theophylline toxicity. Depending on the dose and route of administration, theophylline can have a wide range of cardiovascular, neurologic, metabolic, musculoskeletal, and gastrointestinal manifestations. Emergency department providers should become familiar with managing patients with theophylline toxicity since arrhythmias, seizures, hyperglycemia, and rhabdomyolysis are several of the complications that can arise.\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]",
    "mechanism": "Theophylline has an extremely narrow therapeutic window. Therefore, Theophylline toxicity occurs when serum theophylline levels surpass the levels in the therapeutic range. This can occur by intentional overdose or unintentionally when metabolism and/or clearance of theophylline is altered due to certain physiological stressors.",
    "monitoring": "Workup should include the following:\n\nSerum theophylline level\nSerum glucose: Hyperglycemia is common theophylline toxicity\nComplete metabolic panel: Hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis are common with theophylline toxicity\nComplete blood count (CBC): White blood cells can be elevated due to increase catecholamine release\nSerum calcium: Hypercalcemia is seen in theophylline toxicity\nSerum acetaminophen level, serum salicylate level, urine drug screen: Evaluate for co-ingestion or unknown ingestion\nSerum iron level: Iron toxicity can have a similar presentation to theophylline toxicity\nCreatine kinase: Evaluation for rhabdomyolysis\nLiver function tests: Evaluation of liver dysfunction as the liver metabolizes theophylline.\nECG to evaluate arrhythmias, ischemia, or other toxic ingestions\nConsider CT Head: Evaluation of other potential causes of altered mental status or seizures\n[1]\n[3]",
    "administration": "Most patients with theophylline toxicity are successfully managed with supportive care. Airway, breathing, circulation, and hemodynamic monitoring are essential to patient care with theophylline toxicity. Intubation with ventilator support may be required for airway protection.\n\nGI decontamination: Activated charcoal (1 g/kg) by mouth or nasogastric tube is recommended in patients who present to the emergency department if there are no contraindications to activated charcoal. Gastric lavage or induced emesis is not recommended in theophylline toxicity. Whole bowel irrigation is controversial as animal models do not demonstrate that it is a beneficial therapy. Multiple-dose activated charcoal is recommended for acute theophylline toxicity if there are no contraindications.\n\nHypotension-isotonic saline (20 mL/kg): Hypotension refractory to IV fluid administration, an alpha agonist such as phenylephrine is recommended. Primarily alpha agonists such as norepinephrine can be used as well. Treatment of hypotension with a beta antagonist should only be used in consultation with a toxicologist.\n\nNausea and vomiting: Ondansetron is recommended. Metoclopramide can be used in cases that are refractory to ondansetron.\n\nCardiac arrhythmias: Treatment of cardiac arrhythmias should be managed according to advanced cardiac life support and pediatric advanced life support protocols.\n\nSeizures: In adults, benzodiazepines (lorazepam, midazolam, diazepam) are the first-line treatment for theophylline-induced seizures.  Phenobarbital and continuous infusion of propofol or midazolam can be used for seizures refractory to benzodiazepines. In pediatrics, benzodiazepines are the first-line treatment for seizures. Phenobarbital or continuous infusion of midazolam or pentobarbital or propofol can be used for refractory seizures.\n\nHemodialysis: In acute overdose, hemodialysis is indicated for life-threatening arrhythmias and seizures, theophylline levels greater than 100 mcg/mL, clinical instability, or increased theophylline levels despite appropriate care. In chronic theophylline toxicity, hemodialysis is indicated with severe symptoms, such as life-threatening arrhythmias, seizures, and theophylline levels greater than 60 mcg/mL in patients between the ages of 6 months to 60 years, or levels greater than 50 mcg/mL in patients of age less than 6 months or greater than 60 years. Hemodialysis is preferred as opposed to hemoperfusion. However, if hemodialysis is not available, hemoperfusion may be used instead. Decisions to initiate hemodialysis or hemoperfusion should always be made in consultation with a medical toxicologist.\n\nHypokalemia: Potassium supplementation Is recommended for patients with ventricular arrhythmias or potassium levels less than 3 mEq/L.\n[1]\n[3]\n[5]",
