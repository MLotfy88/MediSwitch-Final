Discontinuation of SSRI/SNRI therapy should be considered in patients who develop symptomatic hyponatremia, and appropriate medical intervention instituted as necessary. Patients should also have their blood pressure and pulse monitored before and during SSRI/SNRI therapy, especially during the first few weeks and following a dosage increase.
