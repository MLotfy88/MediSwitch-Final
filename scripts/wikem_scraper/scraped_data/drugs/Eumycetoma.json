      "text": "Also known as “mycotic mycetoma” and \"Madura foot\"\nChronic subcutaneous fungal skin and soft tissue infection\nCaused by many different types of molds\nInfection occurs following inoculation of conidia into skin or subcutaneous tissue\nUsually confined to subcutaneous tissue but can spread to fascia, bone, and lymph nodes via continguous dissemination\n[1]",
