Based on in vitro data, approximately one-third of human breast cancers are thought to be prolactin-dependent.  The clinical significance of this observation with respect to long-term neuroleptic therapy is unknown.  Chronic administration of neuroleptic drugs has been associated with mammary tumorigenesis in rodent studies but not in human clinical or epidemiologic studies.  Until further data are available, therapy with neuroleptic agents should be administered cautiously in patients with a previously detected breast cancer.  Caution is also advised in patients with preexisting hyperprolactinemia.  Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH), resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotropin secretion.  This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients.  Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds; however, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients.
