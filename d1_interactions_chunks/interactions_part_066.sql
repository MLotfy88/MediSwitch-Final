Serious infections including sepsis, as well as opportunistic infections like Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis, and aspergillosis have been reported with the use of leflunomide, particularly in patients on concomitant hematotoxic therapy.

The risk is thought to extend to teriflunomide, its principal active metabolite, because recommended dosages of both result in a similar range of plasma concentrations of teriflunomide. Serious infections including sepsis, as well as opportunistic infections like Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis, and aspergillosis have been reported with the use of leflunomide, particularly in patients on concomitant hematotoxic therapy.

Rare cases of pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia have also occurred with leflunomide alone, but were most frequent in the presence of concomitant or recent use of methotrexate or other myelotoxic agents. Due to the prolonged elimination half-life of leflunomide''s active metabolite, an interaction may occur even when hematotoxic agents are initiated after the discontinuation of leflunomide.

Theoretically, coadministration with other agents that can prolong the QT interval including tricyclic antidepressants and other antidepressants (e.g., trazodone) may result in additive effects and increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes and sudden death. Concomitant use of agents with serotonergic activity including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and other antidepressants may potentiate the risk of serotonin syndrome, which is a rare but serious and potentially fatal condition thought to result from hyperstimulation of brainstem 5-HT1A and 2A receptors.', 'DDInter', 'The use of citalopram is not recommended in patients receiving other drugs that prolong the QT interval. Citalopram is also not recommended in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, bradycardia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, recent acute myocardial infarction, or uncompensated heart failure. However, if treatment with citalopram is required in these patients, the labeling recommends that the dosage not exceed 40 mg/day, as higher dosages may have an excessive effect on the QT interval and confer no additional benefit in the treatment of depression. In general, the concomitant use of multiple serotonergic agents should be avoided if possible, or otherwise approached with caution if potential benefit is deemed to outweigh the risk. Patients should be closely monitored for symptoms of the serotonin syndrome during treatment. Particular caution is advised when increasing the dosages of these agents. If serotonin syndrome develops or is suspected during the course of therapy, all serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately and supportive care rendered as necessary.

Theoretically, coadministration with other agents that can prolong the QT interval including tricyclic antidepressants and other antidepressants (e.g., trazodone) may result in additive effects and increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes and sudden death. Concomitant use of agents with serotonergic activity including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and other antidepressants may potentiate the risk of serotonin syndrome, which is a rare but serious and potentially fatal condition thought to result from hyperstimulation of brainstem 5-HT1A and 2A receptors.', 'DDInter', 'The use of citalopram is not recommended in patients receiving other drugs that prolong the QT interval. Citalopram is also not recommended in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, bradycardia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, recent acute myocardial infarction, or uncompensated heart failure. However, if treatment with citalopram is required in these patients, the labeling recommends that the dosage not exceed 40 mg/day, as higher dosages may have an excessive effect on the QT interval and confer no additional benefit in the treatment of depression. In general, the concomitant use of multiple serotonergic agents should be avoided if possible, or otherwise approached with caution if potential benefit is deemed to outweigh the risk. Patients should be closely monitored for symptoms of the serotonin syndrome during treatment. Particular caution is advised when increasing the dosages of these agents. If serotonin syndrome develops or is suspected during the course of therapy, all serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately and supportive care rendered as necessary. Moderately ill patients may also benefit from the administration of a serotonin antagonist (e.g., cyproheptadine, chlorpromazine).', 'Synergism', 'The use of citalopram is not recommended in patients receiving other drugs that prolong the QT interval.', 'Major', 'pharmacodynamic', NULL, 'https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/66790/', '[1] Lane R, Baldwin D "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor--induced serotonin syndrome: review."

Concomitant use of agents with serotonergic activity including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and other antidepressants may potentiate the risk of serotonin syndrome, which is a rare but serious and potentially fatal condition thought to result from hyperstimulation of brainstem 5-HT1A and 2A receptors.', 'DDInter', 'The use of citalopram is not recommended in patients receiving other drugs that prolong the QT interval. Citalopram is also not recommended in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, bradycardia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, recent acute myocardial infarction, or uncompensated heart failure. However, if treatment with citalopram is required in these patients, the labeling recommends that the dosage not exceed 40 mg/day, as higher dosages may have an excessive effect on the QT interval and confer no additional benefit in the treatment of depression. In general, the concomitant use of multiple serotonergic agents should be avoided if possible, or otherwise approached with caution if potential benefit is deemed to outweigh the risk. Patients should be closely monitored for symptoms of the serotonin syndrome during treatment. Particular caution is advised when increasing the dosages of these agents. If serotonin syndrome develops or is suspected during the course of therapy, all serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately and supportive care rendered as necessary. Moderately ill patients may also benefit from the administration of a serotonin antagonist (e.g., cyproheptadine, chlorpromazine).', 'Synergism', 'The use of citalopram is not recommended in patients receiving other drugs that prolong the QT interval.', 'Major', 'pharmacodynamic', NULL, 'https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/66843/', '[1] Lane R, Baldwin D "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor--induced serotonin syndrome: review."

Treatment with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists has been associated with dose-dependent prolongation of the QT interval.

For example, a 5-week washout period is typically recommended following use of fluoxetine before administering another serotonergic agent. If serotonin syndrome develops or is suspected during the course of therapy, all serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately and supportive care rendered as necessary. Moderately ill patients may also benefit from the administration of a serotonin antagonist (e.g., cyproheptadine, chlorpromazine).

The proposed mechanism is SSRI inhibition (competitive and/or noncompetitive) of CYP450 2D6, the isoenzyme responsible for the metabolic clearance of beta-blockers such as carvedilol, labetalol, metoprolol, nebivolol, propranolol, and timolol. Paroxetine and norfluoxetine (the active metabolite of fluoxetine), in particular, are potent inhibitors of CYP450 2D6 and may be more likely than other SSRIs to cause the interaction.

Cardiac function should be closely monitored and the beta-blocker dosage adjusted accordingly, particularly following initiation, discontinuation or change of dosage of SSRI in patients who are stabilized on their beta-blocker regimen. Due to the long half-life of fluoxetine and its active metabolite, norfluoxetine, the risk of an interaction may exist for an extended period (up to several weeks) after discontinuation of fluoxetine. To avoid the interaction, use of beta-blockers that are primarily eliminated by the kidney such as atenolol, acebutolol, betaxolol, carteolol, and nadolol may be considered.', 'Metabolism', 'During concomitant therapy with SSRIs, a lower initial dosage and more cautious titration of the beta-blocker may be appropriate.', 'Moderate', 'pharmacodynamic', NULL, 'https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/66970/', '[1] Walley T, Pirmohamed M, Proudlove C, Maxwell D "Interaction of metoprolol and fluoxetine."

Theoretically, coadministration with other agents that can prolong the QT interval including tricyclic antidepressants and other antidepressants (e.g., trazodone) may result in additive effects and increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes and sudden death. Concomitant use of agents with serotonergic activity including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and other antidepressants may potentiate the risk of serotonin syndrome, which is a rare but serious and potentially fatal condition thought to result from hyperstimulation of brainstem 5-HT1A and 2A receptors.', 'DDInter', 'The use of citalopram is not recommended in patients receiving other drugs that prolong the QT interval.

In general, the concomitant use of multiple serotonergic agents should be avoided if possible, or otherwise approached with caution if potential benefit is deemed to outweigh the risk. Patients should be closely monitored for symptoms of the serotonin syndrome during treatment. Particular caution is advised when increasing the dosages of these agents.

The proposed mechanism is SSRI inhibition (competitive and/or noncompetitive) of CYP450 2D6, the isoenzyme responsible for the metabolic clearance of beta-blockers such as carvedilol, labetalol, metoprolol, nebivolol, propranolol, and timolol. Paroxetine and norfluoxetine (the active metabolite of fluoxetine), in particular, are potent inhibitors of CYP450 2D6 and may be more likely than other SSRIs to cause the interaction. On the other hand, fluvoxamine is a potent inhibitor of CYP450 1A2 and may significantly interact with propranolol, which is a substrate of both CYP450 2D6 and 1A2.', 'DDInter', 'During concomitant therapy with SSRIs, a lower initial dosage and more cautious titration of the beta-blocker may be appropriate. Cardiac function should be closely monitored and the beta-blocker dosage adjusted accordingly, particularly following initiation, discontinuation or change of dosage of SSRI in patients who are stabilized on their beta-blocker regimen. Due to the long half-life of fluoxetine and its active metabolite, norfluoxetine, the risk of an interaction may exist for an extended period (up to several weeks) after discontinuation of fluoxetine. To avoid the interaction, use of beta-blockers that are primarily eliminated by the kidney such as atenolol, acebutolol, betaxolol, carteolol, and nadolol may be considered.', 'Metabolism', 'During concomitant therapy with SSRIs, a lower initial dosage and more cautious titration of the beta-blocker may be appropriate.', 'Moderate', 'pharmacodynamic', NULL, 'https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/67056/', '[1] Walley T, Pirmohamed M, Proudlove C, Maxwell D "Interaction of metoprolol and fluoxetine."

Treatment with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists has been associated with dose-dependent prolongation of the QT interval.

For example, a 5-week washout period is typically recommended following use of fluoxetine before administering another serotonergic agent. If serotonin syndrome develops or is suspected during the course of therapy, all serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately and supportive care rendered as necessary. Moderately ill patients may also benefit from the administration of a serotonin antagonist (e.g., cyproheptadine, chlorpromazine).
