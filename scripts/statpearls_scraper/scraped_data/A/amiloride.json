    "indications": "Amiloride can cause fatal hyperkalemia in susceptible patients. Amiloride is contraindicated if serum potassium levels are (>5.5 mEq/L).\n[35]\nAmiloride is contraindicated in acute or chronic renal insufficiency (serum creatinine >1.5 mg/dL or [BUN] >30 mg/dL), anuria, with concomitant use of other potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone or triamterene). Amiloride is contraindicated in documented hypersensitivity to amiloride or excipients.\n[36]\n[37]\n[38]\n\nBox Warning\n\nAmiloride has an FDA-box warning for hyperkalemia, either alone or even when combined with hydrochlorothiazide. Hyperkalemia might be fatal, especially in people with diabetes mellitus, older patients, and patients with renal impairment. Hyperkalemia tends to occur in patients who do not receive a concomitant kaliuretic diuretic. When amiloride is used concomitantly with thiazides, the risk of hyperkalemia drops below 2%. Amiloride should be used cautiously, and serum potassium levels should be carefully monitored in patients, especially during initiation, diuretic dosage adjustments, and any illness that could affect renal function.\n[39]",
    "mechanism": "Amiloride works by inhibiting the epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) in the distal nephron (distal convoluted tubule and cortical collecting duct), lung, and colon. These ENaCs are composed of 2 domains that span the apical membrane. Those domains are denoted M1 and M2. Intracellularly, there are C and N termini, while extracellularly, there is a large loop that contains 2 or 3 cysteine-rich domains. ENaCs have 3 subunits: α, β, and γ.\n[15]\nMutation in β or γ subunits occurs in Liddle syndrome, where basal ENaCs activity increases. Amiloride is beneficial in Liddle syndrome, as described above.\n[16]\n\nUsually, sodium moves down its electrochemical gradient to enter the tubular cells through the ENaCs. This gradient results from the basolateral membrane Na/K ATPase. Reabsorption of Na is associated with depolarization of the apical membrane, which creates a lumen-negative transepithelial potential difference. The difference in electric potential enhances potassium secretion through the apical channels, increasing potassium excretion. Amiloride selectively inhibits ENaCs, decreasing hyperpolarization of the apical membrane and consequently decreasing potassium, hydrogen, calcium, and magnesium secretion. Because amiloride inhibits ENaCs, it can also lead to mild natriuresis.\n[17]\n[18]\nAmiloride also has the potential to cause vasodilation.\n[19]\nProlonged use of amiloride can reduce the excretion of renal uric acid by causing volume contraction and reabsorption of uric acid from the proximal convoluted tubule.\n\nThe loop diuretics and thiazides will increase Na concentration in the distal convoluted tubule and cortical collecting duct. This increase in Na concentration couples with increased Na reabsorption and potassium secretion and excretion. Therefore, co-administration of amiloride with thiazide or loop diuretics decreases their kaliuretic effect and augments their antihypertensive and diuretic effect.\n\nAmiloride helps treat insulin-induced edema. In this condition, ENaCs are upregulated, resulting in increased Na reabsorption and potassium secretion and excretion. However, amiloride is not that effective in hyperaldosteronism when compared to spironolactone and eplerenone.\n[20]\nAmiloride can induce apoptosis in multiple myeloma cell lines in mice, and therefore, it might be used to treat relapsed multiple myeloma in the future. The combination of amiloride with melphalan, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone showed a synergistic effect.\n[13]\n\nPharmacokinetics\n\nAbsorption:\nAmiloride demonstrates an onset of action of 2 hours upon oral administration, with peak plasma concentrations attained within 3 to 4 hours. The effects of amiloride as a diuretic last for approximately 24 hours.\n\nDistribution:\nIt exhibits extravascular distribution and a high volume of distribution (350 to 380 L) due to its small molecular weight and low plasma protein binding (<40%).\n[21]\n[22]\n\nMetabolism:\nAmiloride is excreted unchanged by the kidneys and is not metabolized by the liver. Hence, drug accumulation is not expected in patients with liver dysfunction.\n\nElimination:\nAround 50% of amiloride is excreted unchanged by the kidneys in urine, while approximately 40% is excreted via feces. In individuals with normal kidney function, amiloride has a serum half-life of 6 to 9 hours.\n[3]",
    "administration": "Available Dosage Forms and Strengths\n\nAmiloride is available as an oral tablet with a standardized strength of 5 mg. Amiloride is also available in combination with hydrochlorothiazide.\n[23]\n\nAdult Dosing\n\nCongestive heart failure: 5 to 10 mg by mouth once daily or in divided doses. When managing congestive heart failure and achieving initial diuresis, the potassium loss might diminish, prompting a reassessment of the necessity for amiloride. Dosage adjustments may be required, and the continuation of therapy might be intermittent for maintenance purposes.\n\nHypertension: 5 mg by mouth once daily. The dosage of amiloride may be increased to 10 mg/d if necessary. As per AHA/ACC guidelines, If hypokalemia is present, primary or secondary aldosteronism should be excluded; after careful evaluation, a potassium-sparing diuretic like amiloride can be considered.\n[5]\n\nThiazide-induced hypokalemia: 5 to 10 mg orally once daily or in divided doses.\n[3]\n\nSpecific Patient Populations\n\nHepatic impairment:\nThe product label does not provide information on dose adjustment in case of hepatic impairment.\n\nRenal impairment:\nThe dosage needs to be adjusted in patients with renal impairment and contraindicated in severe renal impairment. AHA/ACC guidelines recommend avoiding amiloride if GFR <45 mL/min.\n[5]\n\nPregnancy considerations:\nAmiloride is acceptable during pregnancy since it is FDA pregnancy category B.\n[24]\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends the use of labetalol or nifedipine for the treatment of gestational hypertension.\n[25]\n\nBreastfeeding considerations:\nNo information is available in the case of breastfeeding, so it is recommended to use alternative medicine.\n[26]\n\nPediatric patients:\nAccording to the FDA label, amiloride has not been established as safe and effective for pediatric patients. It is used off-label for the management of pediatric hypertension.\n[27]\nAmiloride is also used off-label in pediatric patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.\n[28]\n)\n\nOlder patients:\nIt should be used cautiously in patients with diabetes and patients 65 and older.\n[29]\nAs per the American Geriatric Society's 2023 guidelines (Beers criteria), it is advised to refrain from utilizing amiloride in individuals older than 65 with a creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min due to the elevated risk of hyperkalemia and hyponatremia.\n[30]",
    "adverse_effects": "Amiloride is generally well tolerated, with few significant adverse effects other than the risk of hyperkalemia. The most common adverse drug reactions of amiloride include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and headache.\n[3]\n[31]\nOther adverse drug reactions are listed below.\n\nCentral nervous system: fatigue and dizziness\n\nMusculoskeletal system: muscle cramps and weakness\n\nGastrointestinal system: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea/constipation, abdominal pain, and anorexia\n\nRespiratory: dyspnea and cough\n\nGenitourinary: impotence\n\nEndocrine and metabolic: glucose intolerance, hyperuricemia, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, and hyponatremia\n[30]\n\nDrug-Drug Interactions\n\nSimultaneous administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and amiloride can reduce the diuretic and antihypertensive effects of the amiloride. Hence, it is crucial to observe patients when amiloride and NSAIDs are used together to ensure that the desired diuretic effect is achieved. Additionally, monitoring the potassium and renal function is essential since administering amiloride and NSAID may increase serum potassium levels.\n[23]\n\nIt is recommended to avoid concomitant use of drugs that blunt the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, and aliskiren).\n[32]\n[33]\n\nAmiloride is contraindicated with other potassium-sparing diuretics such as potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone or triamterene). Amiloride and cyclosporine both increase serum potassium; coadministration is not recommended.\n[34]",
    "monitoring": "Amiloride requires monitoring for hyperkalemia and impaired renal function.\n[24]\nTherefore, periodic monitoring of serum potassium, BUN, and creatinine concentrations is essential. The parameters that also require monitoring are blood pressure, daily weight, serum bicarbonate, serum magnesium concentrations, and signs or symptoms of hyperkalemia.",
    "toxicity": "The most toxic effect of amiloride is hyperkalemia. A rapid increase in the extracellular potassium leads to an increase in cardiac conduction velocity, which lowers the threshold for rapid phase Na-dependent depolarization. Furthermore, after the initial increase in cardiac conduction velocity, there will be a prolongation of phase 4 diastolic depolarization and a shortening of the action potential, which leads to a delay in the conduction in the atrioventricular node and His-Purkinje system. On ECG, it manifests as a peaked \"tented\" T wave. The QRS complex will widen as the condition worsens, resulting in the so-called ''sine wave''. Therefore, hyperkalemia can lead to increased cardiac excitability or decreased cardiac excitability. Increased cardiac excitation can lead to ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, while a decrease in cardiac depression leads to various degrees of heart block and asystole.\n[40]\nHyperkalemia can also cause an absence of the P wave on ECG.\n[41]\n[42]\nMoreover, patients with hyperkalemia may present with fatigue, dizziness, and weakness.\n[42]\n\nThe initial step in managing amiloride toxicity is to stop all drugs that increase potassium concentrations (including amiloride). The next step is to treat hyperkalemia with 10 mL of 10% calcium gluconate IV over 5 minutes. Because the effect is temporary, another dose might be necessary after 15 minutes. Treating hyperkalemia includes administering rapid-acting insulin, glucose, potassium-binding resins, salbutamol, and sodium bicarbonate.\n[41]\nNormal saline should be administered for volume replacement; hypotensive refractory to volume replacement may require dopamine and norepinephrine.\n[43]"
