Death has occurred in some cases.  In contrast, symptoms of the depressive reaction probably stem from potentiation of CNS effects by MAOIs and include respiratory depression, cyanosis, hypotension, and coma.  There have also been reports of serotonin syndrome, which is a rare but serious and potentially fatal condition thought to result from hyperstimulation of brainstem 5-HT1A and 2A receptors, with symptoms similar to the excitatory reaction described above.

Symptoms of the excitatory reaction may include agitation, headache, diaphoresis, hyperpyrexia, flushing, shivering, myoclonus, rigidity, tremor, diarrhea, hypertension, tachycardia, seizures, and coma.  Death has occurred in some cases.  In contrast, symptoms of the depressive reaction probably stem from potentiation of CNS effects by MAOIs and include respiratory depression, cyanosis, hypotension, and coma.  There have also been reports of serotonin syndrome, which is a rare but serious and potentially fatal condition thought to result from hyperstimulation of brainstem 5-HT1A and 2A receptors, with symptoms similar to the excitatory reaction described above.
