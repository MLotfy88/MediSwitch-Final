    "indications": "Oral melanoacanthoma is a rare, benign macular brown-black lesion, which is usually asymptomatic and distinguished by the sudden appearance and rapid growth. It is found to be secondary to tissue trauma and is self-limiting in nature. In the literature, up to 75% of reported cases are labeled as reactive.\n[1]\nHistologically, it presents with acanthosis of the superficial epithelium and proliferation of dendritic melanocytes.\n[2]\nThe most common location of oral melanoacanthomas is the buccal mucosa, but they can also be seen in labial mucosa, palate, gingiva, alveolar mucosa, and oropharynx.\n[1]\nThere are 2 recognized phenotypes, the multifocal and the singular, the most common of which is the latter.",
    "mechanism": "The etiology of oral melanoacanthoma is yet to be determined, but it is mostly associated with a traumatic process that stimulates melanocyte activity.\n[3]\nThis is supported by the reactive infiltrate of eosinophils found on histopathology, which corroborates the reactive nature. A review of 56 articles of 115 cases concluded that 77% of authors found an association with a reactive etiology.\n[1]\nChronic trauma, or chemical irritants, stimulates melanocytes, which result in either oral pigmentation or a melanoacanthoma. Regular contact with petroleum derivatives found in toothpaste and mouthwashes may act as an irritant agent. These derivatives include sodium lauryl sulfate, phenolphthalein, nitrophenol, chlorophenol, phenylenediamine sulfate, amine fluoride, and cocamidopropyl betaine. Hydrogen peroxide mouthwashes can also irritate the oral mucosa and cause melanoacanthoma. Silver amalgam has also been described as an etiologic factor that may cause morphologic changes and pigmentation, and dental restoration with other materials.\n[1]\nBruxism, biting of the cheeks, poorly fitted removable prosthesis, implant surgery, and non-specific chronic trauma have been reported features preceding the presentation of an oral melanoacanthoma. Other etiologic factors include patients treated for chronic asthma and ferrous lactate for chronic treatment of iron-deficiency anemia.",
    "monitoring": "Since oral melanoacanthomas do not exhibit any distinctive clinical features, the diagnosis is made by histopathological findings. Immunohistochemical staining with monoclonal antibodies for S-100 and HMB-45 is a useful tool to confirm the presence of melanocyte dendritic cells.\n[11]",
    "administration": "Oral melanoacanthoma is a benign entity without any known risk of malignant transformation, so once diagnosed, further treatment is not necessary.\n[12]\nClinical regression of the lesion is even seen after incisional biopsy with a high frequency. If treatment is desired, the lesion may be excised surgically with a negative margin. Argon plasma coagulation has also been utilized with promising results.\n[13]\nCryotherapy, curettage, and the topical application of fluorouracil 5% are other treatment options described in the literature.",
    "adverse_effects": "There are no reported oral melanoacanthoma complications. However, difficulties are mostly secondary to surgical excisions, such as scarring and post-operative pain. Not biopsying an oral pigmented lesion may cause a missed diagnosis of a malignancy, so it behooves the oral surgeon to biopsy all pigmented lesions unless there is a clear component of the patient's history to ascertain the etiology."
