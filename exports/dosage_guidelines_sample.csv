DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of diabetes mellitus with glimepiride or any other hypoglycemic agent. The patient’s fasting blood glucose and HbA1c must be measured periodically to determine the minimum effective dose for the patient; to detect primary failure, i.e., inadequate lowering of blood glucose at the maximum recommended dose of medication; and to detect secondary failure, i.e., loss of adequate blood glucose lowering response after an initial period of effectiveness. Glycosylated hemoglobin levels should be performed to monitor the patient’s response to therapy. Short-term administration of glimepiride may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control in patients usually controlled well on diet and exercise. Usual Starting Dose The usual starting dose of glimepiride tablets USP as initial therapy is 1 to 2 mg once daily, administered with breakfast or the first main meal. Those patients who may be more sensitive to hypoglycemic drugs should be started at 1 mg once daily, and should be titrated carefully. (See PRECAUTIONS Section for patients at increased risk.) No exact dosage relationship exists between glimepiride and the other oral hypoglycemic agents. The maximum starting dose of glimepiride tablets USP should be no more than 2 mg. Failure to follow an appropriate dosage regimen may precipitate hypoglycemia. Patients who do not adhere to their prescribed dietary and drug regimen are more prone to exhibit unsatisfactory response to therapy. Usual Maintenance Dose The usual maintenance dose is 1 to 4 mg once daily. The maximum recommended dose is 8 mg once daily. After reaching a dose of 2 mg, dosage increases should be made in increments of no more than 2 mg at 1 to 2 week intervals based upon the patient’s blood glucose response. Long-term efficacy should be monitored by measurement of HbA1c levels, for example, every 3 to 6 months. Glimepiride-Metformin Combination Therapy If patients do not respond adequately to the maximal dose of glimepiride tablet USP monotherapy, addition of metformin may be considered. Published clinical information exists for the use of other sulfonylureas including glyburide, glipizide, chlorpropamide, and tolbutamide in combination with metformin. With concomitant glimepiride tablets USP and metformin therapy, the desired control of blood glucose may be obtained by adjusting the dose of each drug. However, attempts should be made to identify the minimum effective dose of each drug to achieve this goal. With concomitant glimepiride tablets USP and metformin therapy, the risk of hypoglycemia associated with glimepiride tablets USP therapy continues and may be increased. Appropriate precautions should be taken. Glimepiride-Insulin Combination Therapy Combination therapy with glimepiride tablets USP and insulin may also be used in secondary failure patients. The fasting glucose level for instituting combination therapy is in the range of > 150 mg/dL in plasma or serum depending on the patient. The recommended glimepiride tablet USP dose is 8 mg once daily administered with the first main meal. After starting with low-dose insulin, upward adjustments of insulin can be done approximately weekly as guided by frequent measurements of fasting blood glucose. Once stable, combination-therapy patients should monitor their capillary blood glucose on an ongoing basis, preferably daily. Periodic adjustments of insulin may also be necessary during maintenance as guided by glucose and HbA1c levels. Specific Patient Populations Glimepiride tablets USP are not recommended for use in pregnancy or nursing mothers. Data are insufficient to recommend pediatric use of glimepiride tablets USP. In elderly, debilitated, or malnourished patients, or in patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency, the initial dosing, dose increments, and maintenance dosage should be conservative to avoid hypoglycemic reactions (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Special Populations and PRECAUTIONS, General). Patients Receiving Other Oral Hypoglycemic Agents As with other sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agents, no transition period is necessary when transferring patients to glimepiride tablets USP. Patients should be observed carefully (1 to 2 weeks) for hypoglycemia when being transferred from longer half-life sulfonylureas (e.g., chlorpropamide) to glimepiride tablets USP due to potential overlapping of drug effect.",,DailyMed,False,,,Oral

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended dosage for ZYVOX formulations for the treatment of infections is described in Table 14. Table 14. Dosage Guidelines for ZYVOX InfectionDue to the designated pathogens (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ) Dosage and Route of Administration Recommended Duration of Treatment (consecutive days) Pediatric Patients Neonates <7 days: Most pre-term neonates < 7 days of age (gestational age < 34 weeks) have lower systemic linezolid clearance values and larger AUC values than many full-term neonates and older infants. These neonates should be initiated with a dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg q12h. Consideration may be given to the use of 10 mg/kg q8h regimen in neonates with a sub-optimal clinical response. All neonatal patients should receive 10 mg/kg q8h by 7 days of life (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Special Populations, Pediatric ).

In limited clinical experience, 5 out of 6 (83%) pediatric patients with infections due to Gram-positive pathogens with MICs of 4 µg/mL treated with ZYVOX had clinical cures. However, pediatric patients exhibit wider variability in linezolid clearance and systemic exposure (AUC) compared with adults. In pediatric patients with a sub-optimal clinical response, particularly those with pathogens with MIC of 4 µg/mL, lower systemic exposure, site and severity of infection, and the underlying medical condition should be considered when assessing clinical response (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Special Populations, Pediatric and PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use ). In controlled clinical trials, the protocol-defined duration of treatment for all infections ranged from 7 to 28 days. Total treatment duration was determined by the treating physician based on site and severity of the infection, and on the patient's clinical response. No dose adjustment is necessary when switching from intravenous to oral administration. Patients whose therapy is started with ZYVOX I.V. Injection may be switched to either ZYVOX Tablets or Oral Suspension at the discretion of the physician, when clinically indicated. Intravenous Administration ZYVOX I.V. Injection is supplied in single-use, ready-to-use infusion bags (see HOW SUPPLIED for container sizes). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter prior to administration. Check for minute leaks by firmly squeezing the bag. If leaks are detected, discard the solution, as sterility may be impaired. ZYVOX I.V. Injection should be administered by intravenous infusion over a period of 30 to 120 minutes. Do not use this intravenous infusion bag in series connections. Additives should not be introduced into this solution. If ZYVOX I.V. Injection is to be given concomitantly with another drug, each drug should be given separately in accordance with the recommended dosage and route of administration for each product. In particular, physical incompatibilities resulted when ZYVOX I.V. Injection was combined with the following drugs during simulated Y-site administration: amphotericin B, chlorpromazine HCl, diazepam, pentamidine isothionate, erythromycin lactobionate, phenytoin sodium, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Additionally, chemical incompatibility resulted when ZYVOX I.V. Injection was combined with ceftriaxone sodium. If the same intravenous line is used for sequential infusion of several drugs, the line should be flushed before and after infusion of ZYVOX I.V.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended dosage is a single transdermal system applied to the upper outer arm a minimum of 24 hours, up to a maximum of 48 hours, before chemotherapy. The transdermal system should be worn at minimum, 24 hours after chemotherapy is finished. The transdermal system can be worn for up to 7 days. Application and Removal Instructions Each transdermal system releases 3.1 mg of granisetron per 24 hours for up to 7 days. Each transdermal system is packed in a pouch and should be applied directly after the pouch has been opened. Only wear one transdermal system at any time. Do not cut the transdermal system. Open the pouch and apply the transdermal system to clean, dry, nearly hairless, intact healthy skin on the upper outer arm. Do not place SANCUSO transdermal system on skin that is red, irritated, or damaged. Do not apply a heat pad or heat lamp over or in vicinity of the transdermal system and avoid extended exposure to heat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Cover the application site of the transdermal system with clothing, if there is a risk of exposure to direct natural or artificial sunlight throughout the period of wear and for 10 days following its removal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. After the transdermal system is applied, wash hands thoroughly. Remove the transdermal system by peeling off gently from the skin. Upon removal, fold the transdermal system in half with the sticky side together, and discard in the household trash in a manner that prevents accidental contact or ingestion by children, pets or others. SANCUSO contains granisetron. Do not use other granisetron-containing products with SANCUSO. The recommended dosage is a single transdermal system applied to the upper outer arm a minimum of 24 hours, up to a maximum of 48 hours, before chemotherapy. The transdermal system should be worn at minimum, 24 hours after chemotherapy is finished. The transdermal system can be worn for up to 7 days. (2)",,DailyMed,False,,,Oral

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For oral inhalation use only. (2.1) Use ARIKAYCE vials only with the Lamira Nebulizer System. (2.1) Pre-treatment with inhaled bronchodilator should be considered in patients with a history of hyperreactive airway disease. (2.1) The recommended dosage in adults is once daily oral inhalation of the contents of one 590 mg/8.4 mL ARIKAYCE vial. (2.2) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions ARIKAYCE is for oral inhalation use only. Administer by nebulization only with the Lamira® Nebulizer System. Refer to the Instructions for Use for full administration information on use of ARIKAYCE with the Lamira Nebulizer System. Instruct patients using a bronchodilator ('reliever') to first use the bronchodilator following the bronchodilator leaflet for use information before using ARIKAYCE. Pre-treatment with short-acting selective beta-2 agonists should be considered for patients with known hyperreactive airway disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, or bronchospasm [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 2.2 Recommended Dosage The recommended dosage of ARIKAYCE in adults is once daily inhalation of the contents of one 590 mg/8.4 mL ARIKAYCE vial (590 mg of amikacin) using the Lamira Nebulizer System [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Administer ARIKAYCE with the Lamira Nebulizer System only. ARIKAYCE should be at room temperature before use. Prior to opening, shake the ARIKAYCE vial well for at least 10 to 15 seconds until the contents appear uniform and well mixed. The ARIKAYCE vial is opened by flipping up the plastic top of the vial then pulling downward to loosen the metal ring. The metal ring and the rubber stopper should be removed carefully. The contents of the ARIKAYCE vial can then be poured into the medication reservoir of the nebulizer handset. If a daily dose of ARIKAYCE is missed, administer the next dose the next day.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended starting dose is 5 mg once a day. Depending on the patient's response, the dosage can be decreased to 2.5 mg or increased to 10 mg once a day. These adjustments should occur generally at intervals of not less than 2 weeks. The recommended dosage range is 2.5 - 10 mg once daily. In clinical trials, doses above 10 mg daily showed an increased blood pressure response but a large increase in the rate of peripheral edema and other vasodilatory adverse events (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Modification of the recommended dosage is usually not required in patients with renal impairment. Felodipine extended-release tablets should regularly be taken either without food or with a light meal (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism ). Felodipine extended-release tablets should be swallowed whole and not crushed or chewed. Geriatric Use Patients over 65 years of age are likely to develop higher plasma concentrations of felodipine (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range (2.5 mg daily). Elderly patients should have their blood pressure closely monitored during any dosage adjustment. Patients with Impaired Liver Function Patients with impaired liver function may have elevated plasma concentrations of felodipine and may respond to lower doses of felodipine extended-release tablets; therefore, patients should have their blood pressure monitored closely during dosage adjustment of felodipine extended-release tablets (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ).",,DailyMed,False,,,

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (see table below)Monitoring of blood levels has increased the efficacy and safety of anticonvulsants (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests). Dosage should be adjusted to the needs of the individual patient. A low initial daily dosage with a gradual increase is advised. As soon as adequate control is achieved, the dosage may be reduced very gradually to the minimum effective level. Medication should be taken with meals.Conversion of patients from oral carbamazepine tablets to carbamazepine suspension: Patients should be converted by administering the same number of mg per day in smaller, more frequent doses (i.e., b.i.d. tablets to t.i.d. suspension). Epilepsy (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE) Adults and children over 12 years of age - Initial: 200 mg b.i.d. Increase at weekly intervals by adding up to 200 mg/day using a t.i.d. or q.i.d. regimen until the optimal response is obtained. Dosage generally should not exceed 1000 mg daily in children 12-15 years of age, and 1200 mg daily in patients above 15 years of age. Doses up to 1600 mg daily have been used in adults in rare instances. Maintenance: Adjust dosage to the minimum effective level, usually 800-1200 mg daily. Children 6-12 years of age - Initial: 100 mg b.i.d. Increase at weekly intervals by adding up to 100 mg/day using a t.i.d. or q.i.d. regimen until the optimal response is obtained. Dosage generally should not exceed 1000 mg daily. Maintenance: Adjust dosage to the minimum effective level, usually 400-800 mg daily. Children under 6 years of age - Initial: 10-20 mg/kg/day b.i.d. or t.i.d. Increase weekly to achieve optimal clinical response administered t.i.d. or q.i.d. Maintenance: Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 35 mg/kg. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the therapeutic range. No recommendation regarding the safety of carbamazepine for use at doses above 35 mg/kg/24 hours can be made.Combination Therapy: Carbamazepine may be used alone or with other anticonvulsants. When added to existing anticonvulsant therapy, the drug should be added gradually while the other anticonvulsants are maintained or gradually decreased, except phenytoin, which may have to be increased (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions, and Pregnancy Category D). Trigeminal Neuralgia (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE)Initial: On the first day, 100 mg b.i.d. for a total daily dose of 200 mg. This daily dose may be increased by up to 200 mg/day using increments of 100 mg every 12 hours only as needed to achieve freedom from pain. Do not exceed 1200 mg daily. Maintenance: Control of pain can be maintained in most patients with 400-800 mg daily. However, some patients may be maintained on as little as 200 mg daily, while others may require as much as 1200 mg daily. At least once every 3 months throughout the treatment period, attempts should be made to reduce the dose to the minimum effective level or even to discontinue the drug.Dosage Information Initial DoseSubsequent DoseMaximum Daily Dose IndicationTablet*Tablet*Tablet* * Tablet = Chewable or conventional tablets Epilepsy Under 6 yr10-20 mg/kg/day b.i.d. or t.i.d.Increase weekly to achieve optimal clinical response, t.i.d. or q.i.d.35 mg/kg/24 hr.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • To avoid medication errors and overdosage or under dosage, note that DANZITEN may have different strengths and dosages than other nilotinib products and may not be substitutable with other nilotinib products on a milligram per milligram basis. (2.1)• Recommended Adult Dose: • Newly diagnosed Ph+ CML-CP: 142 mg orally twice daily. • Resistant or intolerant Ph+ CML-CP and CML-AP: 190 mg orally twice daily. (2.2)• See Dosage and Administration for full dosing instructions and dose- reduction instructions for toxicity. (2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9)• Reduce starting dose in patients with baseline hepatic impairment. (2.8)• Eligible newly diagnosed adult patients with Ph+ CML-CP who have received DANZITEN for a minimum of 3 years and have achieved a sustained molecular response (MR4.5) and patients with Ph+ CML-CP resistant or intolerant to imatinib who have received DANZITEN for at least 3 years and have achieved a sustained molecular response (MR4.5) may be considered for treatment discontinuation. (2.3, 2.4, 5.16) 2.1 Important Use and Administration Instructions • Nilotinib is available in different formulations, dosage forms, and strengths that are approved with different indications and recommended dosages.• DANZITEN may not be substitutable with other nilotinib products on a milligram per milligram basis; to avoid medication errors, including overdosage or underdosage, when using DANZITEN ensure that the recommended dosage of DANZITEN (not the recommended dosage of other nilotinib products) is prescribed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. • When switching between DANZITEN (nilotinib) tablets and Tasigna (nilotinib) capsules, use the dosage conversion table [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 2.2 Recommended Dosage and Administration Dosage in Adult Patients with Newly Diagnosed Ph+ CML-CP The recommended dosage of DANZITEN is 142 mg orally twice daily at approximately 12-hour intervals with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Dosage in Adult Patients with Resistant or Intolerant Ph+ CML-CP and CML-AP The recommended dosage of DANZITEN is 190 mg orally twice daily at approximately 12-hour intervals with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Additional Administration Instructions Advise patients to swallow the tablets whole with water and not to cut, crush, or chew the tablets [see Boxed Warning]. If a dose of DANZITEN is missed, the patient should take the next scheduled dose at its regular time. The patient should not take two doses at the same time. Switching Instructions Use Table 1 when switching between DANZITEN and Tasigna based on dosage equivalence. Table 1 Recommendations for Switching between DANZITEN and Tasigna Approved Indications DANZITEN dosage Tasigna dosage Newly diagnosed Ph+ CML-CP 142 mg orally twice daily 300 mg orally twice daily Resistant or intolerant Ph+ CML-CP and CML-AP 190 mg orally twice daily 400 mg orally twice daily Optional Concomitant Therapy DANZITEN may be given in combination with hematopoietic growth factors, such as erythropoietin or G-CSF if clinically indicated. DANZITEN may be given with hydroxyurea or anagrelide if clinically indicated. Additional pediatric use information is approved for Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation’s Tasigna (nilotinib) capsules. However, due to Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 2.3 Discontinuation of Treatment After a Sustained Molecular Response (MR4.5) on DANZITEN Patient Selection Eligibility for Discontinuation of Treatment Ph+ CML-CP patients with typical BCR-ABL transcripts, who have been taking DANZITEN for a minimum of 3 years and have achieved a sustained molecular response (MR4.5, corresponding to = BCR-ABL/ABL ≤ 0.0032% IS), may be eligible for treatment discontinuation [see Clinical Studies (14.3, 14.4)]. Information on FDA authorized tests for the detection and quantitation of BCR-ABL transcripts to determine eligibility for treatment discontinuation is available at http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics.Patients with typical BCR-ABL transcripts (e13a2/b2a2 or e14a2/b3a2), who achieve the sustained MR4.5 criteria, are eligible for discontinuation of DANZITEN. Patients must continue to be monitored for possible loss of molecular remission after treatment discontinuation. Use the same FDA-authorized test to consistently monitor molecular response levels while on and off treatment.Consider discontinuation in patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML-CP who have:• been treated with DANZITEN for at least 3 years• maintained a molecular response of at least MR4.0 (corresponding to = BCR-ABL/ABL ≤ 0.01% IS) for one year prior to discontinuation of therapy• achieved an MR4.5 for the last assessment taken immediately prior to discontinuation of therapy• been confirmed to express the typical BCR-ABL transcripts (e13a2/b2a2 or",,DailyMed,False,,,Oral

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Prior to initiation of caffeine citrate, baseline serum levels of caffeine should be measured in infants previously treated with theophylline, since preterm infants metabolize theophylline to caffeine. Likewise, baseline serum levels of caffeine should be measured in infants born to mothers who con‑sumed caffeine prior to delivery, since caffeine readily crosses the placenta. The recommended loading dose and maintenance doses of caffeine citrate follow. Dose of Caffeine Citrate Dose of Caffeine Citrate Route Frequency Volume mg/kg Loading Dose 1 mL/kg 20 mg/kg Intravenoususing a syringe infusion pump One Time (over 30 minutes) Maintenance 0.25 mL/kg 5 mg/kg Intravenous Every Dose (over 10 24 hoursbeginning 24 hours after the loading dose minutes) or Orally NOTE THAT THE DOSE OF CAFFEINE BASE IS ONE-HALF THE DOSE WHEN EXPRESSED AS CAFFEINE CITRATE (e.g., 20 mg of caffeine citrate is equiva‑lent to 10 mg of caffeine base). Serum concentrations of caffeine may need to be monitored periodically throughout treatment to avoid toxicity. Serious toxicity has been associated with serum levels greater than 50 mg/L. Caffeine citrate injection and caffeine citrate oral solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Vials containing discolored solution or visible particulate matter should be discarded. Drug Compatibility To test for drug compatibility with common intravenous solutions or medica‑tions, 20 mL of caffeine citrate injection were combined with 20 mL of a solution or medication, with the exception of an Intralipid® admixture, which was combined as 80 mL/80 mL. The physical appearance of the com‑bined solutions was evaluated for precipitation. The admixtures were mixed for 10 minutes and then assayed for caffeine. The admixtures were then continu‑ally mixed for 24 hours, with further sampling for caffeine assays at 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours. Based on this testing, caffeine citrate injection, 60 mg/3 mL is chemically stable for 24 hours at room temperature when combined with the following test products. •Dextrose Injection, USP 5% •50% Dextrose Injection USP •Intralipid® 20% IV Fat Emulsion •Aminosyn® 8.5% Crystalline Amino Acid Solution •Dopamine HCI Injection, USP 40 mg/mL diluted to 0.6 mg/mL with Dextrose Injection, USP 5% •Calcium Gluconate Injection, USP 10% (0.465 mEq/Ca+2/mL) •Heparin Sodium Injection, USP 1000 units/mL diluted to 1 unit/mL with Dextrose Injection, USP 5% •Fentanyl Citrate Injection, USP 50 µg/mL diluted to 10 µg/mL with Dextrose Injection, USP 5%",,DailyMed,True,,,Oral

Most patients heal within four weeks. Some patients may require an additional four weeks of therapy. 2.2 H. pylori Eradication for the Reduction of the Risk of Duodenal Ulcer Recurrence Triple Therapy (omeprazole delayed-release capsules/clarithromycin/amoxicillin)-The recommended adult oral regimen is omeprazole delayed-release capsules 20 mg plus clarithromycin 500 mg plus amoxicillin 1000 mg each given twice daily for 10 days. In patients with an ulcer present at the time of initiation of therapy, an additional 18 days of omeprazole delayed-release capsules 20 mg once daily is recommended for ulcer healing and symptom relief. Dual Therapy (omeprazole delayed-release capsules/clarithromycin)-The recommended adult oral regimen is omeprazole delayed-release capsules 40 mg once daily plus clarithromycin 500 mg three times daily for 14 days. In patients with an ulcer present at the time of initiation of therapy, an additional 14 days of omeprazole delayed-release capsules 20 mg once daily is recommended for ulcer healing and symptom relief. 2.3 Gastric Ulcer The recommended adult oral dose is 40 mg once daily for 4-8 weeks. 2.4 Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) The recommended adult oral dose for the treatment of patients with symptomatic GERD and no esophageal lesions is 20 mg daily for up to 4 weeks. The recommended adult oral dose for the treatment of patients with erosive esophagitis and accompanying symptoms due to GERD is 20 mg daily for 4 to 8 weeks. 2.5 Maintenance of Healing of Erosive Esophagitis The recommended adult oral dose is 20 mg daily. [ See Clinical Studies (14.4)] 2.6 Pathological Hypersecretory Conditions The dosage of omeprazole delayed-release capsules in patients with pathological hypersecretory conditions varies with the individual patient. The recommended adult oral starting dose is 60 mg once daily. Doses should be adjusted to individual patient needs and should continue for as long as clinically indicated. Doses up to 120 mg three times daily have been administered. Daily dosages of greater than 80 mg should be administered in divided doses. Some patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome have been treated continuously with omeprazole delayed-release capsules for more than 5 years. 2.7 Pediatric Patients For the treatment of GERD and maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis, the recommended daily dose for pediatric patients 1 to 16 years of age is as follows: Patient Weight Omeprazole Daily Dose 5 < 10 kg 5 mg 10 < 20 kg 10 mg ≥ 20 kg 20 mg On a per kg basis, the doses of omeprazole required to heal erosive esophagitis in pediatric patients are greater than those for adults. Alternative administrative options can be used for pediatric patients unable to swallow an intact capsule [s ee Dosage and Administration (2.8)]. 2.8 Alternative Administration Options Omeprazole delayed-release capsules are available as a delayed-release capsule. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, the contents of a omeprazole delayed-release capsule can be added to applesauce. One tablespoon of applesauce should be added to an empty bowl and the capsule should be opened. All of the pellets inside the capsule should be carefully emptied on the applesauce. The pellets should be mixed with the applesauce and then swallowed immediately with a glass of cool water to ensure complete swallowing of the pellets. The applesauce used should not be hot and should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. The pellets should not be chewed or",,DailyMed,False,,,Oral

Clopidogrel tablets USP may be initiated with or without a loading dose [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. 2.2 Recent MI, Recent Stroke, or Established Peripheral Arterial Disease The recommended daily dose of clopidogrel tablets USP is 75 mg once daily orally, with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.3 CYP2C19 Poor Metabolizers CYP2C19 poor metabolizer status is associated with diminished antiplatelet response to clopidogrel. Although a higher dose regimen in poor metabolizers increases antiplatelet response [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)], an appropriate dose regimen for this patient population has not been established. 2.4 Use With Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPI) Avoid using omeprazole or esomeprazole with clopidogrel tablets USP. Omeprazole and esomeprazole significantly reduce the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel tablets USP. When concomitant administration of a PPI is required, consider using another acid-reducing agent with minimal or no CYP2C19 inhibitory effect on the formation of clopidogrel active metabolite [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].",,DailyMed,False,,,Oral

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of diabetes mellitus with glimepiride or any other hypoglycemic agent. The patient’s fasting blood glucose and HbA1c must be measured periodically to determine the minimum effective dose for the patient; to detect primary failure, i.e., inadequate lowering of blood glucose at the maximum recommended dose of medication; and to detect secondary failure, i.e., loss of adequate blood glucose lowering response after an initial period of effectiveness. Glycosylated hemoglobin levels should be performed to monitor the patient’s response to therapy. Short-term administration of glimepiride may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control in patients usually controlled well on diet and exercise. Usual Starting Dose The usual starting dose of glimepiride tablets USP as initial therapy is 1 to 2 mg once daily, administered with breakfast or the first main meal. Those patients who may be more sensitive to hypoglycemic drugs should be started at 1 mg once daily, and should be titrated carefully. (See PRECAUTIONS Section for patients at increased risk.) No exact dosage relationship exists between glimepiride and the other oral hypoglycemic agents. The maximum starting dose of glimepiride tablets USP should be no more than 2 mg. Failure to follow an appropriate dosage regimen may precipitate hypoglycemia. Patients who do not adhere to their prescribed dietary and drug regimen are more prone to exhibit unsatisfactory response to therapy. Usual Maintenance Dose The usual maintenance dose is 1 to 4 mg once daily. The maximum recommended dose is 8 mg once daily. After reaching a dose of 2 mg, dosage increases should be made in increments of no more than 2 mg at 1 to 2 week intervals based upon the patient’s blood glucose response. Long-term efficacy should be monitored by measurement of HbA1c levels, for example, every 3 to 6 months. Glimepiride-Metformin Combination Therapy If patients do not respond adequately to the maximal dose of glimepiride tablet USP monotherapy, addition of metformin may be considered. Published clinical information exists for the use of other sulfonylureas including glyburide, glipizide, chlorpropamide, and tolbutamide in combination with metformin. With concomitant glimepiride tablets USP and metformin therapy, the desired control of blood glucose may be obtained by adjusting the dose of each drug. However, attempts should be made to identify the minimum effective dose of each drug to achieve this goal. With concomitant glimepiride tablets USP and metformin therapy, the risk of hypoglycemia associated with glimepiride tablets USP therapy continues and may be increased. Appropriate precautions should be taken. Glimepiride-Insulin Combination Therapy Combination therapy with glimepiride tablets USP and insulin may also be used in secondary failure patients. The fasting glucose level for instituting combination therapy is in the range of > 150 mg/dL in plasma or serum depending on the patient. The recommended glimepiride tablet USP dose is 8 mg once daily administered with the first main meal. After starting with low-dose insulin, upward adjustments of insulin can be done approximately weekly as guided by frequent measurements of fasting blood glucose. Once stable, combination-therapy patients should monitor their capillary blood glucose on an ongoing basis, preferably daily. Periodic adjustments of insulin may also be necessary during maintenance as guided by glucose and HbA1c levels. Specific Patient Populations Glimepiride tablets USP are not recommended for use in pregnancy or nursing mothers. Data are insufficient to recommend pediatric use of glimepiride tablets USP. In elderly, debilitated, or malnourished patients, or in patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency, the initial dosing, dose increments, and maintenance dosage should be conservative to avoid hypoglycemic reactions (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Special Populations and PRECAUTIONS, General). Patients Receiving Other Oral Hypoglycemic Agents As with other sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agents, no transition period is necessary when transferring patients to glimepiride tablets USP. Patients should be observed carefully (1 to 2 weeks) for hypoglycemia when being transferred from longer half-life sulfonylureas (e.g., chlorpropamide) to glimepiride tablets USP due to potential overlapping of drug effect.",,DailyMed,False,,,Oral

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes with Metformin HCl, USP or any other pharmacologic agent. Dosage of Metformin HCl, USP must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance, while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily doses. The maximum recommended daily dose of Metformin HCl, USP is 2550 mg in adults and 2000 mg in pediatric patients (10 to 16 years of age). Metformin HCl, USP should be given in divided doses with meals. Metformin HCl, USP should be started at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation, both to reduce gastrointestinal side effects and to permit identification of the minimum dose required for adequate glycemic control of the patient. During treatment initiation and dose titration (see Recommended Dosing Schedule ), fasting plasma glucose should be used to determine the therapeutic response to Metformin HCl, USP and identify the minimum effective dose for the patient. Thereafter, glycosylated hemoglobin should be measured at intervals of approximately three months. The therapeutic goal should be to decrease both fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels to normal or near normal by using the lowest effective dose of Metformin HCl, USP, either when used as monotherapy or in combination with sulfonylurea or insulin. Monitoring of blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin will also permit detection of primary failure, i.e., inadequate lowering of blood glucose at the maximum recommended dose of medication, and secondary failure, i.e., loss of an adequate blood glucose lowering response after an initial period of effectiveness. Short-term administration of Metformin HCl, USP may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control in patients usually well-controlled on diet alone. Recommended Dosing Schedule Adults - In general, clinically significant responses are not seen at doses below 1500 mg per day. However, a lower recommended starting dose and gradually increased dosage is advised to minimize gastrointestinal symptoms. The usual starting dose of Metformin HCl Tablets, USP is 500 mg twice a day or 850 mg once a day, given with meals. Dosage increases should be made in increments of 500 mg weekly or 850 mg every 2 weeks, up to a total of 2000 mg per day, given in divided doses. Patients can also be titrated from 500 mg twice a day to 850 mg twice a day after 2 weeks. For those patients requiring additional glycemic control, Metformin HCl, USP may be given to a maximum daily dose of 2550 mg per day. Doses above 2000 mg may be better tolerated given three times a day with meals. If higher doses of metformin are required, Metformin HCl, USP should be used at total daily doses up to 2550 mg administered in divided daily doses, as described above. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Studies .) Pediatrics - The usual starting dose of Metformin HCl, USP is 500 mg twice a day, given with meals. Dosage increases should be made in increments of 500 mg weekly up to a maximum of 2000 mg per day, given in divided doses. Transfer From Other Antidiabetic Therapy When transferring patients from standard oral hypoglycemic agents other than chlorpropamide to Metformin HCl, USP, no transition period generally is necessary. When transferring patients from chlorpropamide, care should be exercised during the first two weeks because of the prolonged retention of chlorpropamide in the body, leading to overlapping drug effects and possible hypoglycemia. Concomitant Metformin HCl, USP and Oral Sulfonylurea Therapy in Adult Patients If patients have not responded to four weeks of the maximum dose of Metformin HCl, USP monotherapy, consideration should be given to gradual addition of an oral sulfonylurea while continuing Metformin HCl, USP at the maximum dose, even if prior primary or secondary failure to a sulfonylurea has occurred. Clinical and pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction data are currently available only for metformin plus glyburide (glibenclamide). With concomitant Metformin HCl, USP and sulfonylurea therapy, the desired control of blood glucose may be obtained by adjusting the dose of each drug. In a clinical trial of patients with type 2 diabetes and prior failure on glyburide, patients started on Metformin HCl, USP 500 mg and glyburide 20 mg were titrated to 1000/20 mg, 1500/20 mg, 2000/20 mg or 2500/20 mg of Metformin HCl, USP and glyburide, respectively, to reach the goal of glycemic control as measured by FPG, HbA1c and plasma glucose response (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Studies ). However, attempts should be made to identify the minimum effective dose of each drug to achieve this goal. With concomitant Metformin HCl, USP and sulfonylurea therapy, the risk of hypoglycemia associated with sulfonylurea therapy continues and may be increased. Appropriate precautions should be taken.

Administration with food may be helpful in diminishing potential gastrointestinal complaints occasionally associated with oral cephalosporin therapy. Adults Urinary Tract Infections: For uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections (i.e., cystitis) the usual dosage is 1 or 2 g per day in a single (q.d.) or divided doses (b.i.d.). For all other urinary tract infections the usual dosage is 2 g per day in divided doses (b.i.d.). Skin and Skin Structure Infections: For skin and skin structure infections the usual dosage is 1 g per day in single (q.d.) or divided doses (b.i.d.). Pharyngitis and Tonsillitis: Treatment of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis and tonsillitis-1 g per day in single (q.d.) or divided doses (b.i.d.) for 10 days. Children For urinary tract infections, the recommended daily dosage for children is 30 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 12 hours. For pharyngitis, tonsillitis, and impetigo, the recommended daily dosage for children is 30 mg/kg/day in a single dose or in equally divided doses every 12 hours. For other skin and skin structure infections, the recommended daily dosage is 30 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses every 12 hours. In the treatment of beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections, a therapeutic dosage of Cefadroxil should be administered for at least 10 days. Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment, the dosage of cefadroxil monohydrate should be adjusted according to creatinine clearance rates to prevent drug accumulation. The following schedule is suggested. In adults, the initial dose is 1000 mg of cefadroxil monohydrate and the maintenance dose (based on the creatinine clearance rate [mL/min/1.73 m2]) is 500 mg at the time intervals listed below.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes with metformin or any other pharmacologic agent. Dosage of metformin must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance, while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily doses. The maximum recommended daily dose of metformin is 2550 mg in adults and 2000 mg in pediatric patients (10-16 years of age).Metformin should be given in divided doses with meals and should be started at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation, both to reduce gastrointestinal side effects and to permit identification of the minimum dose required for adequate glycemic control of the patient.During treatment initiation and dose titration (see Recommended Dosing Schedule), fasting plasma glucose should be used to determine the therapeutic response to metformin and identify the minimum effective dose for the patient.

For those patients requiring additional glycemic control, metformin may be given to a maximum daily dose of 2550 mg per day. Doses above 2000 mg may be better tolerated given three times a day with meals. Pediatrics The usual starting dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets is 500 mg twice a day, given with meals. Dosage increases should be made in increments of 500 mg weekly up to a maximum of 2000 mg per day, given in divided doses. Transfer from Other Antidiabetic Therapy When transferring patients from standard oral hypoglycemic agents other than chlorpropamide to metformin, no transition period generally is necessary. When transferring patients from chlorpropamide, care should be exercised during the first two weeks because of the prolonged retention of chlorpropamide in the body, leading to overlapping drug effects and possible hypoglycemia. Concomitant Metformin Hydrochloride and Oral Sulfonylurea Therapy in Adult Patients If patients have not responded to four weeks of the maximum dose of metformin HCl monotherapy, consideration should be given to gradual addition of an oral sulfonylurea while continuing metformin HCl tablets at the maximum dose, even if prior primary or secondary failure to a sulfonylurea has occurred. Clinical and pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction data are currently available only for metformin plus glyburide (glibenclamide).With concomitant metformin HCl and sulfonylurea therapy, the desired control of blood glucose may be obtained by adjusting the dose of each drug.

Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of ESA therapy. Monitoring of Response to Therapy Correct or exclude other causes of anemia (e.g., vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding, etc.) before initiating Aranesp. Following initiation of therapy and after each dose adjustment, monitor hemoglobin weekly until the hemoglobin level is stable and sufficient to minimize the need for RBC transfusion. 2.2 Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease In controlled trials, patients experienced greater risks for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL. No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, Aranesp dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks. Individualize dosing and use the lowest dose of Aranesp sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Physicians and patients should weigh the possible benefits of decreasing transfusions against the increased risks of death and other serious cardiovascular adverse events [see Boxed Warning and Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ]. For all patients with CKD When initiating or adjusting therapy, monitor hemoglobin levels at least weekly until stable, then monitor at least monthly. When adjusting therapy consider hemoglobin rate of rise, rate of decline, ESA responsiveness and hemoglobin variability. A single hemoglobin excursion may not require a dosing change. Do not increase the dose more frequently than once every 4 weeks. Decreases in dose can occur more frequently. Avoid frequent dose adjustments. If the hemoglobin rises rapidly (e.g., more than 1 g/dL in any 2-week period), reduce the dose of Aranesp by 25% or more as needed to reduce rapid responses. For patients who do not respond adequately, if the hemoglobin has not increased by more than 1 g/dL after 4 weeks of therapy, increase the dose by 25%. For patients who do not respond adequately over a 12-week escalation period, increasing the Aranesp dose further is unlikely to improve response and may increase risks. Use the lowest dose that will maintain a hemoglobin level sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions. Evaluate other causes of anemia. Discontinue Aranesp if responsiveness does not improve. For adult patients with CKD on dialysis : Initiate Aranesp treatment when the hemoglobin level is less than 10 g/dL. If the hemoglobin level approaches or exceeds 11 g/dL, reduce or interrupt the dose of Aranesp. The recommended starting dose is 0.45 mcg/kg intravenously or subcutaneously as a weekly injection or 0.75 mcg/kg once every 2 weeks as appropriate. The intravenous route is recommended for patients on hemodialysis. For adult patients with CKD not on dialysis : Consider initiating Aranesp treatment only when the hemoglobin level is less than 10 g/dL and the following considerations apply:° The rate of hemoglobin decline indicates the likelihood of requiring a RBC transfusion and, ° Reducing the risk of alloimmunization and/or other RBC transfusion-related risks is a goal. If the hemoglobin level exceeds 10 g/dL, reduce or interrupt the dose of Aranesp, and use the lowest dose of Aranesp sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions. The recommended starting dose is 0.45 mcg/kg body weight intravenously or subcutaneously given once at four week intervals as appropriate. For pediatric patients with CKD : Initiate Aranesp treatment when the hemoglobin level is less than 10 g/dL. If the hemoglobin level approaches or exceeds 12 g/dL, reduce or interrupt the dose of Aranesp.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Oral administration is preferred. Although most patients with malabsorption cannot absorb food folates, they are able to absorb folic acid given orally. Parenteral administration is not advocated but may be necessary in some individuals (e.g., patients receiving parenteral or enteral alimentation). Doses greater than 0.1 mg should not be used unless anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency has been adequately treated with a cobalamin. Daily doses greater than 1 mg do not enhance the hematologic effect, and most of the excess is excreted unchanged in the urine.The usual therapeutic dosage in adults and children (regardless of age) is up to 1 mg daily. Resistant cases may require larger doses.When clinical symptoms have subsided and the blood picture has become normal, a daily maintenance level should be used, i.e., 0.1 mg for infants and up to 0.3 mg for children under 4 years of age, 0.4 mg for adults and children 4 or more years of age, and 0.8 mg for pregnant and lactating women, but never less than 0.1 mg/day. Patients should be kept under close supervision and adjustment of the maintenance level made if relapse appears imminent.In the presence of alcoholism, hemolytic anemia, anticonvulsant therapy, or chronic infection, the maintenance level may need to be increased.",,DailyMed,False,,,Oral

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For oral administration DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT. The initial dosage varies from 0.75 to 9 mg a day depending on the disease being treated. In less severe diseases doses lower than 0.75 mg may suffice, while in severe diseases doses higher than 9 mg may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until the patient's response is satisfactory. If satisfactory clinical response does not occur after a reasonable period of time, discontinue Baycadron™ Elixir and transfer the patient to other therapy. After a favorable initial response, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial dosage in small amounts to the lowest dosage that maintains an adequate clinical response. Patients should be observed closely for signs that might require dosage adjustment, including changes in clinical status resulting from remissions or exacerbations of the disease, individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of stress (e.g., surgery, infection, trauma). During stress it may be necessary to increase dosage temporarily. If the drug is to be stopped after more than a few days of treatment, it usually should be withdrawn gradually. The following milligram equivalents facilitate changing to Baycadron™ Elixir from other glucocorticoids: BAYCADRON™ ELIXIR METHYLPREDNISOLONE AND TRIAMCINOLONE PREDNISOLONEANDPREDNISONE HYDROCORTISONE CORTISONE 0.75 mg = 4 mg = 5 mg = 20 mg = 25 mg Dexamethasone suppression tests Tests for Cushing's syndrome.Give 1 mg of Dexamethasone orally at 11:00 p.m. Blood is drawn for plasma cortisol determination at 8:00 a.m. the following morning.For greater accuracy, give 0.5 mg of Dexamethasone orally every 6 hours for 48 hours.

2DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Initial Dose Titration Target Dose Effective Dose Range Schizophrenia – adults (2.1) 2 mg/day 1 to 2 mg daily 4 to 8 mg daily 4 to 16 mg / day Bipolar mania- adults (2.2) 2 to 3 mg / day 1 mg daily 1 to 6 mg / day 1 to 6 mg / day 2.1Schizophrenia AdultsUsual Initial DoseRisperidone can be administered once or twice daily. Initial dosing is generally 2 mg/day. Dose increases should then occur at intervals not less than 24 hours, in increments of 1 to 2 mg/day, as tolerated, to a recommended dose of 4 to 8 mg/day. In some patients, slower titration may be appropriate. Efficacy has been demonstrated in a range of 4 to 16 mg/day [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. However, doses above 6 mg/day for twice daily dosing were not demonstrated to be more efficacious than lower doses, were associated with more extrapyramidal symptoms and other adverse effects, and are generally not recommended. In a single study supporting once-daily dosing, the efficacy results were generally stronger for 8 mg than for 4 mg. The safety of doses above 16 mg/day has not been evaluated in clinical trials. Maintenance TherapyWhile it is unknown how long a patient with schizophrenia should remain on risperidone, the effectiveness of risperidone 2 mg/day to 8 mg/day at delaying relapse was demonstrated in a controlled trial in patients who had been clinically stable for at least 4 weeks and were then followed for a period of 1 to 2 years[see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment with an appropriate dose. AdolescentsDue to Janssen Pharmaceuticals Corporation’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled for use in pediatric patients with schizophrenia. Dosage and administration information for pediatric patients with schizophrenia, 13 to 17 years of age, is approved for Janssen Pharmaceuticals Corporation’s risperidone drug product. Reinitiation of Treatment in Patients Previously DiscontinuedAlthough there are no data to specifically address reinitiation of treatment, it is recommended that after an interval off risperidone, the initial titration schedule should be followed. Switching From Other AntipsychoticsThere are no systematically collected data to specifically address switching schizophrenic patients from other antipsychotics to risperidone, or treating patients with concomitant antipsychotics. While immediate discontinuation of the previous antipsychotic treatment may be acceptable for some schizophrenic patients, more gradual discontinuation may be most appropriate for others. The period of overlapping antipsychotic administration should be minimized. When switching schizophrenic patients from depot antipsychotics, initiate risperidone therapy in place of the next scheduled injection. The need for continuing existing EPS medication should be re-evaluated periodically. 2.2Bipolar Mania Usual DoseAdultsRisperidone should be administered on a once-daily schedule, starting with 2 mg to 3 mg per day. Dosage adjustments, if indicated, should occur at intervals of not less than 24 hours and in dosage increments/decrements of 1 mg per day, as studied in the short-term, placebo-controlled trials. In these trials, short-term (3 week) anti-manic efficacy was demonstrated in a flexible dosage range of 1 to 6 mg per day [see Clinical Studies (14.2, 14.3)]. Risperidone doses higher than 6 mg per day were not studied. PediatricsDue to Janssen Pharmaceuticals Corporation’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled for use in pediatric patients with bipolar mania, 10 to 17 years of age. Dosage and administration information for the treatment of pediatric patients with bipolar disorder is approved for Janssen Pharmaceuticals Corporation’s risperidone drug products. Maintenance TherapyThere is no body of evidence available from controlled trials to guide a clinician in the longer-term management of a patient who improves during treatment of an acute manic episode with risperidone. While it is generally agreed that pharmacological treatment beyond an acute response in mania is desirable, both for maintenance of the initial response and for prevention of new manic episodes, there are no systematically obtained data to support the use of risperidone in such longer-term treatment (i.e., beyond 3 weeks). The physician who elects to use risperidone for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term risks and benefits of the drug for the individual patient. 2.3Irritability Associated with Autistic Disorder – Pediatrics (Children and Adolescents) Due to Janssen Pharmaceuticals Corporation’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled for use in pediatric patients with irritability associated with autistic disorder.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Blood pressure decreases associated with any dose of ramipril depend, in part, on the presence or absence of volume depletion (e.g., past and current diuretic use) or the presence or absence of renal artery stenosis. If such circumstances are suspected to be present, the initial starting dose should be 1.25 mg once daily. Hypertension The recommended initial dose for patients not receiving a diuretic is 2.5 mg once a day. Dosage should be adjusted according to the blood pressure response. The usual maintenance dosage range is 2.5 to 20 mg per day administered as a single dose or in two equally divided doses. In some patients treated once daily, the antihypertensive effect may diminish toward the end of the dosing interval. In such patients, an increase in dosage or twice daily administration should be considered. If blood pressure is not controlled with ramipril alone, a diuretic can be added.After the initial dose of ramipril, the patient should be observed under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions.) If possible, the dose of any concomitant diuretic should be reduced which may diminish the likelihood of hypotension. The appearance of hypotension after the initial dose of ramipril does not preclude subsequent careful dose titration with the drug, following effective management of the hypotension.The ramipril capsule is usually swallowed whole. The ramipril capsule can also be opened and the contents sprinkled on a small amount (about 4 oz.) of apple sauce or mixed in 4 oz. (120 ml) of water or apple juice. To be sure that ramipril is not lost when such a mixture is used, the mixture should be consumed in its entirety. The described mixtures can be pre-prepared and stored for up to 24 hours at room temperature or up to 48 hours under refrigeration.Concomitant administration of ramipril with potassium supplements, potassium salt substitutes, or potassiumsparing diuretics can lead to increases of serum potassium. (See PRECAUTIONS.)In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic hypotension occasionally can occur following the initial dose of ramipril. To reduce the likelihood of hypotension, the diuretic should, if possible, be discontinued two to three days prior to beginning therapy with ramipril. (See WARNINGS.) Then, if blood pressure is not controlled with ramipril alone, diuretic therapy should be resumed.If the diuretic cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 1.25 mg ramipril should be used to avoid excess hypotension. Dosage Adjustment in Renal Impairment In patients with creatinine clearance <40 mL/min/1.73m2 (serum creatinine approximately >2.5 mg/dL) doses only 25% of those normally used should be expected to induce full therapeutic levels of ramiprilat. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY.)Hypertension: For patients with hypertension and renal impairment, the recommended initial dose is 1.25 mg ramipril once daily.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION General Considerations The workup and treatment of candidates for clomiphene citrate therapy should be supervised by physicians experienced in management of gynecologic or endocrine disorders. Patients should be chosen for therapy with clomiphene citrate only after careful diagnostic evaluation (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE). The plan of therapy should be outlined in advance. Impediments to achieving the goal of therapy must be excluded or adequately treated before beginning clomiphene citrate. The therapeutic objective should be balanced with potential risks and discussed with the patient and others involved in the achievement of a pregnancy. Ovulation most often occurs from 5 to 10 days after a course of clomiphene citrate. Coitus should be timed to coincide with the expected time of ovulation. Appropriate tests to determine ovulation may be useful during this time. Recommended Dosage Treatment of the selected patient should begin with a low dose, 50 mg daily (1 tablet) for 5 days. The dose should be increased only in those patients who do not ovulate in response to cyclic 50 mg clomiphene citrate. A low dosage or duration of treatment course is particularly recommended if unusual sensitivity to pituitary gonadotropin is suspected, such as in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (see WARNINGS; Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome). The patient should be evaluated carefully to exclude pregnancy, ovarian enlargement, or ovarian cyst formation between each treatment cycle. If progestin-induced bleeding is planned, or if spontaneous uterine bleeding occurs prior to therapy, the regimen of 50 mg daily for 5 days should be started on or about the 5th day of the cycle. Therapy may be started at any time in the patient who has had no recent uterine bleeding. When ovulation occurs at this dosage, there is no advantage to increasing the dose in subsequent cycles of treatment. If ovulation does not appear to occur after the first course of therapy, a second course of 100 mg daily (two 50 mg tablets given as a single daily dose) for 5 days should be given. This course may be started as early as 30 days after the previous one after precautions are taken to exclude the presence of pregnancy. Increasing the dosage or duration of therapy beyond 100 mg/day for 5 days is not recommended. The majority of patients who are going to ovulate will do so after the first course of therapy. If ovulation does not occur after three courses of therapy, further treatment with clomiphene citrate is not recommended and the patient should be reevaluated. If three ovulatory responses occur, but pregnancy has not been achieved, further treatment is not recommended. If menses does not occur after an ovulatory response, the patient should be reevaluated. Long-term cyclic therapy is not recommended beyond a total of about six cycles (see PRECAUTIONS).",,DailyMed,False,,,Oral

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Protect from light. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Hydroxocobalamin injection should be given only intramuscularly. In patients with Addisonian Pernicious Anemia, parenteral therapy with vitamin B12 is the recommended method of treatment and will be required for the remainder of the patient’s life. Oral therapy is not dependable. In other patients with vitamin B12 deficiency, the duration of therapy and route of administration will depend upon the cause and whether or not it is reversible. Confirmatory diagnostic studies should be performed prior to initiating therapy, if possible, and the patient should be followed with appropriate studies to demonstrate hematologic improvement (Hgb, hematocrit, RBC, reticulocyte count). A diagnostic trial utilizing physiologic doses of vitamin B12 (1 mcg daily) and observing daily reticulocyte counts after establishing a baseline may also be performed. The observation of reticulocytosis which usually occurs between the third and tenth day of therapy confirms the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency. In seriously ill patients it may be advisable to administer both vitamin B12 and folic acid while awaiting the results of distinguishing laboratory studies. It is not necessary to withhold vitamin B12 therapy until the precise cause of B12 deficiency is established since absorption studies can be performed at any time. Serum potassium should be closely observed the first 48 hours and potassium should be administered if necessary. Treatment of Vitamin B12 Deficiency Thirty mcg daily for 5 to 10 days followed by 100 to 200 mcg monthly injected intramuscularly. If the patient is critically ill, or has neurologic disease, an infectious disease or hyperthyroidism, considerably higher doses may be indicated. However, current data indicate that the optimum obtainable neurologic response may be expected with a dosage of vitamin B12 sufficient to produce good hematologic response.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For rapid bolus intravenous use only. Adenosine Injection should be given as a rapid bolus by the peripheral intravenous route. To be certain the solution reaches the systemic circulation, it should be administered either directly into a vein or, if given into an IV line, it should be given as close to the patient as possible and followed by a rapid se flush. Adult Patients The dose recommendation is based on clinical studies with peripheral venous bolus dosing. Central venous (CVP or other) administration of adenosine has not been systematically studied. The recommended intravenous doses for adults are as fo Initial dose: 6 mg given as a rapid intravenous bolus (administered over a 1 to 2 second pe Repeat administration: If the first dose does not result in elimination of the supraventricular tachycardia within 1 to 2 minutes, 12 mg should be given as a rapid intravenous bolus. This 12 mg dose may be repeated a second time if required. Pediatric Patients The dosages used in neonates, infants, children and adolescents were equivalent to those administered to adults on a weight basis. Pediatric Patients with a Body Weight < 50 kg: Initial dose: Give 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg as a rapid IV bolus given either centrally or peripherally. A saline flush should follow. Repeat administration: If conversion of PSVT does not occur within 1 to 2 minutes, additional bolus injections of adenosine can be administered at incrementally higher doses, increasing the amount given by 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg. Follow each bolus with a saline flush. This process should continue until sinus rhythm is established or a maximum single dose of 0.3 mg/kg is used. Pediatric Patients with a Body Weight ≥ 50 kg: Administer the adult dose. Doses greater than 12 mg are not recommended for adult and pediatric patients.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Initiate infusion of sodium nitroprusside at a rate of 0.3 mcg/kg/min, and titrate every few minutes until the desired effect is achieved OR the maximum recommended infusion rate of 10 mcg/kg/min has been reached (2.2). 2.1 Inspection Inspect parenteral drug products for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Sodium nitroprusside should be a clear colorless to red/brown color; do not use if solution is blue, green, or bright red. 2.2 Dosing Continuously monitor blood pressure in patients receiving sodium nitroprusside. Start infusion of sodium nitroprusside at a rate of 0.3 mcg/kg/min. Evaluate blood pressure for at least 5 minutes before titrating to a higher or lower dose to achieve the desired blood pressure. The dose may be titrated upward until: •the desired effect is achieved, •systemic blood pressure cannot be further reduced without compromising the perfusion of vital organs, or •the maximum recommended infusion rate of 10 mcg/kg/min has been reached, whichever occurs first. In patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2, limit the mean infusion rate to less than 3 mcg/kg/min. In anuric patients, limit the mean infusion rate to 1 mcg/kg/min. 2.3 Administration Do not administer other drugs in the same solution with sodium nitroprusside. Sodium nitroprusside must be delivered by a volumetric infusion pump because small variations in infusion rate can lead to wide, undesirable variations in blood pressure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].",,DailyMed,True,,,Intravenous

2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Application of one ORAVIG 50 mg buccal tablet to the gum region once daily for 14 consecutive days (2.1). Instruct patients not to crush, chew, or swallow tablets (2.2). 2.1 Basic Dosing Information The recommended dosing schedule for ORAVIG is the application of one 50 mg buccal tablet to the upper gum region (canine fossa) once daily for 14 consecutive days. 2.2 Administration Instructions ORAVIG should be applied in the morning, after brushing the teeth. The tablet should be applied with dry hands. The rounded side surface of the tablet should be placed against the upper gum just above the incisor tooth (canine fossa) and held in place with slight pressure over the upper lip for 30 seconds to ensure adhesion. The tablet is round on one side for comfort, but either side of the tablet can be applied to the gum. Once applied, ORAVIG stays in position and gradually dissolves. [ See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] Subsequent applications of ORAVIG should be made to alternate sides of the mouth. Before applying the next tablet, the patient should clear away any remaining tablet material. In addition, ORAVIG should not be crushed, chewed or swallowed. Food and drink can be taken normally when ORAVIG is in place but chewing gum should be avoided. If ORAVIG does not adhere or falls off within the first 6 hours, the same tablet should be repositioned immediately. If the tablet still does not adhere, a new tablet should be placed. If ORAVIG is swallowed within the first 6 hours, the patient should drink a glass of water and a new tablet should be applied only once. If ORAVIG falls off or is swallowed after it was in place for 6 hours or more, a new tablet should not be applied until the next regularly scheduled dose.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Ceftriaxone for injection may be administered intravenously or intramuscularly. Do not use diluents containing calcium, such as Ringer's solution or Hartmann's solution, to reconstitute ceftriaxone for injection vials or to further dilute a reconstituted vial for IV administration because a precipitate can form. Precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium can also occur when ceftriaxone for injection is mixed with calcium-containing solutions in the same IV administration line. Ceftriaxone for injection must not be administered simultaneously with calcium-containing IV solutions, including continuous calcium-containing infusions such as parenteral nutrition via a Y-site. However, in patients other than neonates, ceftriaxone for injection and calcium-containing solutions may be administered sequentially of one another if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid (see WARNINGS). There have been no reports of an interaction between ceftriaxone and oral calcium-containing products or interaction between intramuscular ceftriaxone and calcium-containing products (IV or oral). NEONATES: Hyperbilirubinemic neonates, especially prematures, should not be treated with ceftriaxone for injection (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Ceftriaxone for injection is contraindicated in neonates if they require (or are expected to require) treatment with calcium-containing IV solutions, including continuous calcium-containing infusions such as parenteral nutrition because of the risk of precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). PEDIATRIC PATIENTS: For the treatment of skin and skin structure infections, the recommended total daily dose is 50 to 75 mg/kg given once a day (or in equally divided doses twice a day). The total daily dose should not exceed 2 grams. For the treatment of acute bacterial otitis media, a single intramuscular dose of 50 mg/kg (not to exceed 1 gram) is recommended (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE). For the treatment of serious miscellaneous infections other than meningitis, the recommended total daily dose is 50 to 75 mg/kg, given in divided doses every 12 hours. The total daily dose should not exceed 2 grams. In the treatment of meningitis, it is recommended that the initial therapeutic dose be 100 mg/kg (not to exceed 4 grams). Thereafter, a total daily dose of 100 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 4 grams daily) is recommended. The daily dose may be administered once a day (or in equally divided doses every 12 hours). The usual duration of therapy is 7 to 14 days. ADULTS: The usual adult daily dose is 1 to 2 grams given once a day (or in equally divided doses twice a day) depending on the type and severity of infection. The total daily dose should not exceed 4 grams. If Chlamydia trachomatis is a suspected pathogen, appropriate antichlamydial coverage should be added, because ceftriaxone sodium has no activity against this organism. For the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal infections, a single intramuscular dose of 250 mg is recommended. For preoperative use (surgical prophylaxis), a single dose of 1 gram administered intravenously 1/2 to 2 hours before surgery is recommended. Generally, ceftriaxone for injection therapy should be continued for at least 2 days after the signs and symptoms of infection have disappeared. The usual duration of therapy is 4 to 14 days; in complicated infections, longer therapy may be required. When treating infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, therapy should be continued for at least 10 days. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with impairment of renal or hepatic function. DIRECTIONS FOR USE: Intramuscular Administration: Reconstitute ceftriaxone for injection powder with the appropriate diluent (see COMPATIBILITY AND STABILITY ). Inject diluent into vial, shake vial thoroughly to form solution. Withdraw entire contents of vial into syringe to equal total labeled dose. After reconstitution, each 1 mL of solution contains approximately 250 mg or 350 mg equivalent of ceftriaxone according to the amount of diluent indicated below. If required, more dilute solutions could be utilized. A 350 mg/mL concentration is not recommended for the 250 mg vial since it may not be possible to withdraw the entire contents. As with all intramuscular preparations, ceftriaxone for injection should be injected well within the body of a relatively large muscle; aspiration helps to avoid unintentional injection into a blood vessel. Vial Dosage Size Amount of Diluent to be Added 250 mg / mL 350 mg / mL 250 mg 0.9 mL - 500 mg 1.8 mL 1.0 mL 1 g 3.6 mL 2.1 mL 2 g 7.2 mL 4.2 mL Intravenous Administration: Ceftriaxone for injection should be administered intravenously by infusion over a period of 30 minutes. Concentrations between 10 mg/mL and 40 mg/mL are recommended; however, lower concentrations may be used if desired.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adults: The dose of clonidine hydrochloride must be adjusted according to the patient’s individual blood pressure response. The following is a general guide to its administration. Initial Dose: 0.1 mg tablet twice daily (morning and bedtime). Elderly patients may benefit from a lower initial dose. Maintenance Dose: Further increments of 0.1 mg per day may be made at weekly intervals if necessary until the desired response is achieved. Taking the larger portion of the oral daily dose at bedtime may minimize transient adjustment effects of dry mouth and drowsiness. The therapeutic doses most commonly employed have ranged from 0.2 mg to 0.6 mg per day given in divided doses. Studies have indicated that 2.4 mg is the maximum effective daily dose, but doses as high as this have rarely been employed.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Gentamicin injection may be given IM or IV. The patient’s pretreatment body weight should be obtained for calculation of correct dosage. The dosage of aminoglycosides in obese patients should be based on an estimate of the lean body mass. It is desirable to limit the duration of treatment with aminoglycosides to short term. Patients with Normal Renal Function Adults The recommended dosage of gentamicin injection for patients with serious infections and normal renal function is 3 mg/kg/day, administered in three equal doses every eight hours (Table 1). For patients with life-threatening infections, dosages up to 5 mg/kg/day may be administered in three or four equal doses. This dosage should be reduced to 3 mg/kg/day as soon as clinically indicated (Table 1). It is desirable to measure both peak and trough serum concentrations of gentamicin to determine the adequacy and safety of the dosage. When such measurements are feasible, they should be carried out periodically during therapy to assure adequate but not excessive drug levels. For example, the peak concentration (at 30 to 60 minutes after IM injection) is expected to be in the range of 4 to 6 mcg/mL. When monitoring peak concentrations after IM or IV administration, dosage should be adjusted so that prolonged levels above 12 mcg/mL are avoided. When monitoring trough concentrations (just prior to the next dose), dosage should be adjusted so that levels above 2 mcg/mL are avoided. Determination of the adequacy of a serum level for a particular patient must take into consideration the susceptibility of the causative organism, the severity of the infection and the status of the patient’s host-defense mechanisms. In patients with extensive burns, altered pharmacokinetics may result in reduced serum concentrations of aminoglycosides. In such patients treated with gentamicin, measurement of serum concentrations is recommended as a basis for dosage adjustment.

Children 6 to 7.5 mg/kg/day (2 to 2.5 mg/kg administered every eight hours). Infants and Neonates 7.5 mg/kg/day (2.5 mg/kg administered every eight hours). Premature or Full-Term Neonates One Week of Age or Less 5 mg/kg/day (2.5 mg/kg administered every 12 hours). For further information concerning the use of gentamicin in infants and children, see gentamicin injection (pediatric) product information. The usual duration of treatment for all patients is 7 to 10 days. In difficult and complicated infections, a longer course of therapy may be necessary. In such cases monitoring of renal, auditory and vestibular functions is recommended, since toxicity is more apt to occur with treatment extended for more than 10 days. Dosage should be reduced if clinically indicated. For Intravenous Administration The IV administration of gentamicin may be particularly useful for treating patients with bacterial septicemia or those in shock. It may also be the preferred route of administration for some patients with congestive heart failure, hematologic disorders, severe burns or those with reduced muscle mass. For intermittent IV administration in adults, a single dose of gentamicin injection may be diluted in 50 to 200 mL of sterile isotonic saline solution or in a sterile solution of dextrose 5% in water; in infants and children, the volume of diluent should be less. The solution may be infused over a period of one-half to two hours. The recommended dosage for IM and IV administration is identical. Gentamicin injection should not be physically premixed with other drugs, but should be administered separately in accordance with the recommended route of administration and dosage schedule. Patients with Impaired Renal Function Dosage must be adjusted in patients with impaired renal function to assure therapeutically adequate, but not excessive blood levels. Whenever possible serum concentration of gentamicin should be monitored. One method of dosage adjustment is to increase the interval between administration of the usual doses. Since the serum creatinine concentration has a high correlation with the serum half-life of gentamicin, this laboratory test may provide guidance for",,DailyMed,True,,,Intravenous

Parenteral administration is not advocated but may be necessary in some individuals (e.g., patients receiving parenteral or enteral alimentation). Doses greater than 0.1 mg should not be used unless anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency has been adequately treated with a cobalamin. Daily doses greater than 1 mg do not enhance the hematologic effect, and most of the excess is excreted unchanged in the urine.The usual therapeutic dosage in adults and children (regardless of age) is up to 1 mg daily. Resistant cases may require larger doses.When clinical symptoms have subsided and the blood picture has become normal, a daily maintenance level should be used, i.e., 0.1 mg for infants and up to 0.3 mg for children under 4 years of age, 0.4 mg for adults and children 4 or more years of age, and 0.8 mg for pregnant and lactating women, but never less than 0.1 mg/day.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION It is important that patients understand the instructions for use of NICOTROL NS, and have their questions answered. They should clearly understand the directions for using NICOTROL NS and safely disposing of the used container. They should be instructed to stop smoking completely when they begin using the product. Patients should be instructed not to sniff, swallow or inhale through the nose as the spray is being administered. They should also be advised to administer the spray with the head tilted back slightly. The dose of NICOTROL NS, should be individualized on the basis of each patient's nicotine dependence and the occurrence of symptoms of nicotine excess (See Individualization of Dosage). Each actuation of NICOTROL NS delivers a metered 50 microliter spray containing 0.5 mg of nicotine. One dose is 1 mg of nicotine (2 sprays, one in each nostril). Patients should be started with 1 or 2 doses per hour, which may be increased up to a maximum recommended dose of 40 mg (80 sprays, somewhat less than 1/2 bottle) per day. For best results, patients should be encouraged to use at least the recommended minimum of 8 doses per day, as less is unlikely to be effective. In clinical trials, the patients who successfully quit smoking used the product heavily when nicotine withdrawal was at its peak, sometimes up to the recommended maximum of 40 doses per day ( in heavier smokers). Dosing recommendations are summarized in Table 4. Table 4: Maximum Recommended Duration of Treatment Recommended Doses per Hour Maximum Doses per Hour Maximum Doses per Day 3 months 1–2One dose=2 sprays (one in each nostril). One dose delivers 1 mg of nicotine to the nasal mucosa. 5 40 No tapering strategy has been shown to be optimal in clinical studies. Many patients simply stopped using the spray at their last clinic visit. Recommended strategies for discontinuation of use include suggesting that patients: use only 1/2 a dose (1 spray) at a time, use the spray less frequently, keep a tally of daily usage, try to meet a steadily reducing usage target, skip a dose by not medicating every hour, or set a planned ""quit date"" for stopping use of the spray. Individualization of Dosage The success or failure of smoking cessation is influenced by the quality, intensity and frequency of supportive care. Patients are more likely to quit smoking if they are seen frequently and participate in formal smoking cessation programs. The goal of NICOTROL NS therapy is complete abstinence. If a patient is unable to stop smoking by the fourth week of therapy, treatment should probably be discontinued. Patients who fail to quit on any attempt may benefit from interventions to improve their chances for success on subsequent attempts. Patients who were unsuccessful should be counseled and should then probably be given a ""therapy holiday"" before the next attempt. A new quit attempt should be encouraged when conditions are more favorable. Based on the clinical trials, a reasonable approach to assisting patients in their attempt to quit smoking is to begin initial treatment, using the recommended dosage (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Regular use of the spray during the first week of treatment may help patients adapt to the irritant effects of the spray. Dosage can then be adjusted in those subjects with signs or symptoms of nicotine withdrawal or excess. Patients who are successfully abstinent on NICOTROL NS should be treated at the selected dosage for up to 8 weeks, following which use of the spray should be discontinued over the next 4 to 6 weeks. Some patients may not require gradual reduction of dosage and may abruptly stop treatment successfully. Treatment with NICOTROL NS for longer periods has not been shown to improve outcome, and the safety of use for periods longer than 6 months has not been established. The symptoms of nicotine withdrawal overlap those of nicotine excess (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacodynamics and ADVERSE REACTIONS). Since patients using NICOTROL NS may also smoke intermittently, it is sometimes difficult to determine if patients are experiencing nicotine withdrawal or nicotine excess. Controlled clinical trials of nicotine products suggest that palpitations, nausea and sweating are more often symptoms of nicotine excess, whereas anxiety, nervousness and irritability are more often symptoms of nicotine withdrawal.",,DailyMed,False,,,Oral

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION NoteDo not add dobutamine injection to 5% Sodium Bicarbonate Injection or to any other strongly alkaline solution. Because of potential physical incompatibilities, it is recommended that dobutamine injection not be mixed with other drugs in the same solution. Dobutamine injection should not be used in conjunction with other agents or diluents containing both sodium bisulfite and ethanol. Preparation and StabilityAt the time of administration, dobutamine injection must be further diluted in an IV container to at least a 50-mL solution using one of the following intravenous solutions as a diluent: 5% Dextrose Injection, 5% Dextrose and 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, 5% Dextrose and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, 10% Dextrose Injection, Isolyte® M with 5% Dextrose Injection, Lactated Ringers Injection, 5% Dextrose in Lactated Ringers Injection, Normosol®-M in D5-W, 20% Osmitrol® in Water for Injection, 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, or Sodium Lactate Injection. Intravenous solution should be used within 24 hours. Recommended DosageInfusion of dobutamine should be started at a low rate (0.5-1.0 g/kg/min) and titrated at intervals of a few minutes, guided by the patients response, including systemic blood pressure, urine flow, frequency of ectopic activity, heart rate, and (whenever possible) measurements of cardiac output, central venous pressure, and/or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. In reported trials, the optimal infusion rates have varied from patient to patient, usually 2-20 g/kg/min but sometimes slightly outside of this range. On rare occasions, infusion rates up to 40 g/kg/min have been required to obtain the desired effect. Rates of infusion (mL/h) for dobutamine injection concentrations of 500 g/mL, 1,000 g/mL, and 2,000 g/mL necessary to attain various delivery rates of dobutamine (g/kg/min) for patients of different weights are given in Table 1.

JANUVIA can be taken with or without food. 2.2 Patients with Renal Insufficiency For patients with mild renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance [CrCl] ≥50 mL/min, approximately corresponding to serum creatinine levels of ≤1.7 mg/dL in men and ≤1.5 mg/dL in women), no dosage adjustment for JANUVIA is required. For patients with moderate renal insufficiency (CrCl ≥30 to <50 mL/min, approximately corresponding to serum creatinine levels of >1.7 to ≤3.0 mg/dL in men and >1.5 to ≤2.5 mg/dL in women), the dose of JANUVIA is 50 mg once daily. For patients with severe renal insufficiency (CrCl <30 mL/min, approximately corresponding to serum creatinine levels of >3.0 mg/dL in men and >2.5 mg/dL in women) or with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, the dose of JANUVIA is 25 mg once daily. JANUVIA may be administered without regard to the timing of hemodialysis. Because there is a need for dosage adjustment based upon renal function, assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiation of JANUVIA and periodically thereafter. Creatinine clearance can be estimated from serum creatinine using the Cockcroft-Gault formula. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).] 2.3 Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue (e.g., Sulfonylurea) or with Insulin When JANUVIA is used in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or with insulin, a lower dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION When Lidocaine Ointment 5% is used concomitantly with other products containing lidocaine, the total dose contributed by all formulations must be kept in mind. Adult A single application should not exceed 5 g of Lidocaine Ointment 5%, containing 250 mg of lidocaine base (equivalent chemically to approximately 300 mg of lidocaine hydrochloride). This is roughly equivalent to squeezing a six (6) inch length of ointment from the tube. In a 70 kg adult this dose equals 3.6 mg/kg (1.6 mg/lb) lidocaine base. No more than one-half tube, approximately 17-20 g of ointment or 850-1000 mg lidocaine base, should be administered in any one day. Although the incidence of adverse effects with Lidocaine Ointment 5% is quite low, caution should be exercised, particularly when employing large amounts, since the incidence of adverse effects is directly proportional to the total dose of local anesthetic agent administered. Dosage for children It is difficult to recommend a maximum dose of any drug for children since this varies as a function of age and weight. For children less than ten years who have a normal lean body mass and a normal lean body development, the maximum dose may be determined by the application of one of the standard pediatric drug formulas (e.g., Clark's rule). For example a child of five years weighing 50 lbs., the dose of lidocaine should not exceed 75-100 mg when calculated according to Clark's rule. In any case, the maximum amount of lidocaine administered should not exceed 4.5 mg/kg (2.0 mg/lb) of body weight. Administration For medical use, apply topically for adequate control of symptoms. The use of a sterile gauze pad is suggested for application to broken skin tissue. Apply to the tube prior to intubation. In dentistry, apply to previously dried oral mucosa. Subsequent removal of excess saliva with cotton rolls or saliva ejector minimizes dilution of the ointment, permits maximum penetration, and minimizes the possibility of swallowing the topical ointment. For use in connection with the insertion of new dentures, apply to all denture surfaces contacting mucosa. IMPORTANT: Patients should consult a dentist at intervals not exceeding 48 hours throughout the fitting period.",,DailyMed,True,,,Oral

Therapy should generally be continued for 14 to 21 days or until there is resolution of active fungal keratitis. In many cases, it may be helpful to reduce the dosage gradually at 4 to 7 day intervals to assure that the replicating organism has been eliminated.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Sotret should be administered with a meal (see PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients).The recommended dosage range for Sotret is 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg/day given in two divided doses with food for 15 to 20 weeks. In studies comparing 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mg/kg/day,8 it was found that all dosages provided initial clearing of disease, but there was a greater need for retreatment with the lower dosages. During treatment, the dose may be adjusted according to response of the disease and/or the appearance of clinical side effects — some of which may be dose related. Adult patients whose disease is very severe with scarring or is primarily manifested on the trunk may require dose adjustments up to 2.0 mg/kg/day, as tolerated. Failure to take Sotret with food will significantly decrease absorption. Before upward dose adjustments are made, the patients should be questioned about their compliance with food instructions.The safety of once daily dosing with Sotret has not been established. Once daily dosing is not recommended.If the total nodule count has been reduced by more than 70% prior to completing 15 to 20 weeks of treatment, the drug may be discontinued. After a period of 2 months or more off therapy, and if warranted by persistent or recurring severe nodular acne, a second course of therapy may be initiated. The optimal interval before retreatment has not been defined for patients who have not completed skeletal growth. Long-term use of Sotret, even in low doses, has not been studied, and is not recommended. It is important that Sotret be given at the recommended doses for no longer than the recommended duration. The effect of long-term use of Sotret on bone loss is unknown (see WARNINGS: Skeletal: Bone Mineral Density, Hyperostosis, and Premature Epiphyseal Closure).Contraceptive measures must be followed for any subsequent course of therapy (see PRECAUTIONS).Table 3 Sotret Dosing by Body Weight (Based on Administration With Food) Body WeightTotal mg/day *See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: the recommended dosage range is 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg/day. kilogramspounds0.5 mg/kg1 mg/kg2 mg/kg* 4088204080 501102550100 601323060120 701543570140 801764080160 901984590180 10022050100200",,DailyMed,True,,,
