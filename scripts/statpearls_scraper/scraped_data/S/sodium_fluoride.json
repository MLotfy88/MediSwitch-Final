    "clinical_significance": "Glucose is derived from the breakdown of carbohydrates, and its availability is essential for providing energy to the human body. The body tightly controls glucose within a normal, healthy range through endocrine hormones such as insulin and glucagon. Other hormones that can significantly affect glucose levels are cortisol, epinephrine, and thyroid hormone.\n[13]\n[14]\nWhen symptoms of abnormally controlled blood glucose bring a patient to seek medical attention, a blood glucose measurement is an essential aspect of data collection to determine the pathology and treatment of the condition.\n\nSome physiological conditions associated with hyperglycemia include a high carbohydrate diet, anxiety, emotional stress, and pregnancy. Pathological conditions associated with hyperglycemia include hyperpituitarism, hyperthyroidism, hyperadrenalism, and diabetes mellitus.\n[15]\n\nDiabetes mellitus can be further classified into type I and type II. Type I diabetes is caused by autoimmune destruction of beta-cells within the pancreas and typically presents early in life. The beta-cells are responsible for insulin secretion; thus, in type 1 diabetes, there is an absolute insulin deficiency. Type II diabetes is more of a progressive loss of function of the beta-cells and is mainly due to insulin resistance. Type II diabetes typically occurs in adults with risk factors such as obesity, a sedentary lifestyle, and a family history of the disease. Chronically elevated glucose levels can lead to microvascular damage within the kidneys, the eyes, and the peripheral nerves; this damage can manifest as nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy.\n[16]\n\nHyperpituitarism, hyperthyroidism, and hyperadrenalism are disorders in which aberrant hormonal signaling within the body increases the breakdown of molecules into glucose or the production of glucose. Although the pathophysiology of these disorders is different from that of diabetes mellitus, one of their manifestations is abnormally elevated blood glucose levels, and, thus, accurate measurements of glucose levels aid in the clinical diagnosis.\n[17]\n\nHypoglycemia can also occur physiologically, such as during prolonged fasting or after intense, strenuous exercise. Pathological conditions associated with hypoglycemia include insulin overdose or an insulin-secreting tumor, hypothyroidism, hypopituitarism, and Addison disease. Excess insulin causes the body to take up too much glucose from the blood and thus causes hypoglycemia. Hypothyroidism, hypopituitarism, and Addison disease are all disorders in which the body's endocrine hormones that signal the body's organs to increase blood glucose are lacking. Although other symptoms are associated with these diseases, hypoglycemia is a common and clinically relevant finding.\n[18]\n\nJust as well-controlled blood glucose is essential for overall health, accurate glucose measurements are crucial for a clinician to provide the best care to a patient."
