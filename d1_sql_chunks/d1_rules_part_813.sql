In vitro data indicate that the taurine conjugate of obeticholic acid (tauro-obeticholic acid) is a substrate of BSEP.  Consequently, concomitant use of medications that inhibit the BSEP, a canalicular membrane bile acid transporter, may result in further accumulation of tauro-obeticholic acid and other conjugated bile salts in the liver.  Clinical symptoms and toxicities may occur.  Additionally, obeticholic acid and its conjugates are selective and potent agonists for the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), the activation of which leads to induction of BSEP.

Some experts have recommended that administration of measles virus vaccine be deferred for at least 8 months following human intravenous immune globulin therapy for immunodeficiency disease; 8 to 10 months following treatment for immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP); and at least 11 months following treatment for Kawasaki syndrome.  In the event that immune globulin and measles virus vaccine must be administered concurrently, it is advisable to separate the injection sites by as much as possible and to administer an additional dose of vaccine at the appropriate specified interval.  An additional dose of live measles, mumps, or rubella vaccine is usually not needed if the vaccine was administered at least two weeks prior to immune globulin administration.  Hepatitis B immune globulin has been reported to not interfere with measles vaccination, although data are limited.', 'Antagonism', 'Varicella virus vaccine should not be given for at least 5 months, and other live vaccines should not be given for at least 3 months, after administration of immune globulin.', NULL, NULL, 'Moderate', 'pharmacodynamic');
