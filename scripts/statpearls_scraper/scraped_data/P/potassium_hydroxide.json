    "clinical_significance": "Hair growth rate and hair density decrease with age. Hair loss, known as alopecia, is a common occurrence. The condition can be due to factors like drugs, diet, hormone imbalances, altered mitotic activity, and growth cycle abnormalities. A thorough history, physical exam, hair pull test, daily hair counts, part width, hair shaft clip tests, hair growth windows, hair pluck, and trichograms can all be used to diagnose hair disease. Scalp biopsies, hormone studies, and a potassium hydroxide examination for fungi may also need to be performed in certain cases. Hair disease must be correctly diagnosed, as the treatment for hair loss depends on the diagnosis.\n\nMale-pattern baldness, known as androgenetic alopecia, is a common condition where hair loss occurs as men age. Anagen cycles shorten progressively with increased dihydrotestosterone binding to the follicle of hair receptors. The hair follicles shrink and gradually produce shorter, thinner, more vellus-like hairs. Possible treatments may include slowing the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone in men with this condition.\n[25]\n[26]"
