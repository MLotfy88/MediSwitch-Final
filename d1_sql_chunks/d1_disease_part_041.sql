Based on in vitro data, approximately one-third of human breast cancers are thought to be prolactin-dependent.  The clinical significance of this observation with respect to long-term neuroleptic therapy is unknown.  Chronic administration of neuroleptic drugs has been associated with mammary tumorigenesis in rodent studies but not in human clinical or epidemiologic studies.  Until further data are available, therapy with neuroleptic agents should be administered cautiously in patients with a previously detected breast cancer.  Caution is also advised in patients with preexisting hyperprolactinemia.  Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH), resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotropin secretion.  This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients.  Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds; however, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients.

The risk appears highest in older patients (particularly older women) but it is not possible to predict which patients are likely to develop TD; whether antipsychotic drugs differ in their potential to cause TD is unknown.  The risk of TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible increase with the duration of therapy and the total cumulative dose.  The syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods, even at low dosages; it may also occur after discontinuation of therapy.  TD may remit (partially or completely) upon discontinuation of antipsychotic therapy, although antipsychotic therapy itself may suppress (or partially suppress) signs/symptoms of TD, possibly masking the underlying process; the effect of symptomatic suppression on the long-term course of TD is unknown.  In patients with preexisting drug-induced TD, initiating or increasing the dosage of antipsychotic therapy may temporarily mask the symptoms of TD but could eventually worsen the condition.  In patients requiring chronic therapy, the lowest dose and shortest duration of therapy producing a satisfactory clinical response are recommended; the need for continued therapy should be reassessed periodically.  If signs/symptoms of TD occur during antipsychotic therapy, discontinuation of the offending agent should be considered; however, some patients may require treatment despite the presence of TD.', '2', '"Product Information.
