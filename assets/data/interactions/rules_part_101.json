Serious infections and sepsis, including fatalities, have been reported with the use of TNF blockers, particularly in patients on concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. Agents that may be significantly myelo- or immunosuppressive include antineoplastic agents, radiation, zidovudine, linezolid, some antirheumatic agents, high dosages of corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic agents, and long-term topical or inhaled corticosteroids. Concomitant use of TNF blockers with other immunosuppressants such as azathioprine or mercaptopurine may also increase the risk of a rare and often fatal cancer of white blood cells known as hepatosplenic T-Cell lymphoma (HSTCL).",
      "management_text": "Patients receiving a TNF blocker alone or with other immunosuppressive or myelosuppressive agents should be monitored closely for the development of infections. TNF blocker therapy should be discontinued if a serious infection or sepsis occurs. Close monitoring for signs and symptoms of HSTCL (e.g., splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, abdominal pain, persistent fever, night sweats, weight loss) is also recommended during use of TNF blockers, particularly in combination with other immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and mercaptopurine.",

      "effect": "The antidiuretic response to vasopressin or desmopressin may be potentiated by certain drugs, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic/tetracyclic antidepressants, carbamazepine, chlorpropamide, chlorpromazine, clofibrate, eslicarbazepine, fludrocortisone, haloperidol, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, urea, and some antineoplastic agents (e.g., vinca alkaloids, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide). These drugs can occasionally cause fluid retention, in some cases secondary to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Coadministration with vasopressin or desmopressin may, therefore, increase the risk of water intoxication and/or hyponatremia. Seizure and coma in association with severe hyponatremia have been reported during concomitant use of desmopressin and imipramine or ibuprofen.",
      "management_text": "Caution is advised when vasopressin or desmopressin is used in combination with drugs that can cause fluid retention or SIADH. Some authorities recommend adjusting vasopressin dosage as needed. Serum electrolytes, especially sodium, as well as BUN and creatinine should be monitored regularly. Patients should be advised to seek medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms of water intoxication or hyponatremia such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, headache, malaise, lethargy, irritability, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, muscle spasm, unsteadiness (which may lead to falls), anuria, and weight gain. Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated; therefore, early treatment is important to help prevent progression to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, and death.",

Caution is advised when inotersen is prescribed with high dosages and/or chronic use of NSAIDs. Serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR), and a urinalysis should be obtained prior to initiation of inotersen and regularly during and for at least 8 weeks after treatment in accordance with the product labeling.

The risk of hypocalcemia may also be increased, as drug-induced renal tubular damage can lead to renal loss of calcium and other electrolytes such as magnesium. Bisphosphonates alone often cause mild, asymptomatic hypocalcemia via inhibitive effects on bone resorption and possibly chelation of blood calcium.

Methemoglobinemia should be considered if central cyanosis is unresponsive to oxygen. Calculated oxygen saturation and pulse oximetry are generally not accurate in the setting of methemoglobinemia. The diagnosis can be confirmed by an elevated methemoglobin level of at least 10% using co-oximetry. Methemoglobin concentrations greater than 10% of total hemoglobin will typically cause cyanosis, and levels over 70% are frequently fatal. However, symptom severity is not always related to methemoglobin levels. Mild cases often respond to withdrawal of offending agents and symptomatic support. If patient does not respond to administration of oxygen, clinically significant or symptomatic methemoglobinemia can be treated with methylene blue 1 to 2 mg/kg by slow intravenous injection over 5 to 10 minutes, which may be repeated within 30 to 60 minutes if necessary.

In severe cases, patients may progress to central nervous system depression, stupor, seizures, acidosis, cardiac arrhythmias, syncope, shock, coma, and death.  Methemoglobinemia should be considered if central cyanosis is unresponsive to oxygen.  Calculated oxygen saturation and pulse oximetry are generally not accurate in the setting of methemoglobinemia.

Methemoglobin concentrations greater than 10% of total hemoglobin will typically cause cyanosis, and levels over 70% are frequently fatal.  However, symptom severity is not always related to methemoglobin levels.  Mild cases often respond to withdrawal of offending agents and symptomatic support.  If patient does not respond to administration of oxygen, clinically significant or symptomatic methemoglobinemia can be treated with methylene blue 1 to 2 mg/kg by slow intravenous injection over 5 to 10 minutes, which may be repeated within 30 to 60 minutes if necessary.
