Fluorinated corticosteroids such as betamethasone, dexamethasone, and triamcinolone appear to cause more severe muscle atrophy and weakness than the nonfluorinated agents.  Moreover, multiple-daily doses are more toxic than once-daily or, preferably, alternate-day morning doses.  Steroid myopathy is generalized and sometimes accompanied by respiratory weakness and dyspnea.  In some cases, it has resulted in quadriparesis.  Elevations of creatine kinase (CK) may also occur, albeit infrequently.  After withdrawal of corticosteroid therapy, recovery may be slow and incomplete.  Therapy with corticosteroids should be administered cautiously in patients with preexisting myopathy or myoneural disorders since these conditions may confound the diagnosis of steroid-induced myopathy.  The presence of a normal serum CK level, minimal/no changes of myopathy on electromyography, and type 2 muscle fiber atrophy on biopsy are helpful in suggesting steroid-induced weakness.

Tolerance to the hypotensive effects often develops after a few doses to a few weeks.  Rarely, collapse and sudden death have occurred secondary to severe hypotension.  Other reported adverse cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmias, heart block, hypertension, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, myocardial infarction, strokes, congestive heart failure, and ECG abnormalities such as PR and QT interval prolongation.  Therapy with TCAs should be avoided during the acute recovery phase following myocardial infarction, and should be administered only with extreme caution in patients with hyperthyroidism, a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or a predisposition to hypotension.

At therapeutic analgesic dosages, the respiratory effects are usually not clinically important except in patients with preexisting pulmonary impairment.  Therapy with opiate agonists should be avoided or administered with extreme caution and initiated at reduced dosages in patients with severe CNS depression; sleep apnea; hypoxia, anoxia, or hypercapnia; upper airway obstruction; chronic pulmonary insufficiency; a limited ventilatory reserve; or other respiratory disorders.  In the presence of excessive respiratory secretions, the use of opiate agonists may also be problematic because they decrease ciliary activity and reduce the cough reflex.  Caution is also advised in patients who may be at increased risk for respiratory depression, such as comatose patients or those with head injury, intracranial lesions, or intracranial hypertension.
