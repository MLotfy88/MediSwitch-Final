Hypoglycemia has usually occurred in patients with diabetes receiving concomitant oral hypoglycemic agents and/or insulin.  Administration of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, norfloxacin, and especially gatifloxacin in patients treated with sulfonylureas or other oral hypoglycemic agents has resulted in severe, refractory hypoglycemia and hypoglycemic coma.  Elderly patients and patients with reduced renal function are particularly susceptible.  Blood glucose should be monitored more closely whenever quinolones are prescribed to patients with diabetes.  Gatifloxacin has been known to cause hypoglycemic episodes generally within the first 3 days of therapy and sometimes even after the first dose, while hyperglycemia usually occurs 4 to 10 days after initiation of therapy.  Patients should be counseled to recognize symptoms of hypoglycemia such as headache, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, tremor, weakness, hunger, excessive perspiration, and palpitations.  If hypo- or hyperglycemia occur during quinolone therapy, patients should initiate appropriate remedial therapy immediately, discontinue the antibiotic, and contact their physician.', '2', 'DDInter', 0);
