    "indications": "The word \"trauma\" derives from the Greek word for \"wound\" or \"hurt.\" Mental health or psychological trauma has since become more broadly defined as an experience that is subjectively perceived as painful or distressing and results in acute or chronic mental and physical impairment or dysfunction.\n[1]\n[2]\nThe\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\n, 5th edition (DSM-5), defines a traumatic event as the exposure to \"death, threatened death, actual or threatened serious injury, or actual or threatened sexual violence.\" Trauma may be experienced either through direct involvement or by witnessing or learning of such an event happening to others and is often accompanied by a sense of shock, helplessness, or loss of control.\n\nTrauma can be categorized and described across myriad factors, and one such categorization is acute versus chronic forms of trauma. These can include the sudden loss of a loved one, physical abuse, sexual predation, natural disasters, or exposure to war and violence, among many others. Causes of trauma are thus ubiquitous and a nearly universal human experience. Traumas can occur throughout the lifespan; current data suggest that childhood trauma leads to worse outcomes than trauma experienced in adulthood.\n[3]\n[4]\n\nTrauma is typically described as either an acute or chronic process. The acute trauma response or acute stress reaction is characterized by a short-lived sympathetic response to a real or perceived threat that typically results in a \"fight or flight\" response. If this response does not resolve or the perceived threats remain ongoing, this initial acute response can progress to a chronic trauma response. This chronic response is often associated with significant impairment and comorbidity.\n[5]\n\nLike acute stress reactions, chronic stress reactions can occur in response to a single traumatic event or following multiple stressors. Chronic trauma usually presents with aberrant behavioral and physiological processes, outlined in the DSM-5 as the following symptom clusters: (1) hyperarousal states, (2) avoidance behaviors, (3) intrusive trauma-associated memories, and (4) altered cognitions and moods.\n[6]\nThese symptoms can occur in both Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), which are further distinguished by the duration of the symptoms following a traumatic event, where ASD lasts less than a month, and PTSD lasts greater than a month, respectively.\n[7]\n[5]\n\nIn addition to acute and chronic trauma, complex trauma includes repeated trauma exposure that can be severe and prolonged, resulting from the perversion or loss of a significant relationship.\n[8]\n[9]\nWhile repeated trauma exposures may occur in adulthood, this typically occurs in childhood or adolescence and is often perpetrated by adult caregivers or other authority figures who were previously perceived as trustworthy or protective. Such trauma tends to be characterized by the real or perceived impossibility of escape; this sense of feeling trapped and a loss of safety leads to trauma responses such as hypervigilance and persistent negative mood.\n[8]\nComplex posttraumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) includes the symptoms of PTSD accompanied by dysfunction in self-concept, affect regulation, and relationships.\n[9]",
    "mechanism": "The causes of trauma are manifold and can include:\n\nNatural disasters such as tornados, hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, etc.\nAccidents such as motor vehicle accidents, chemical spills, etc.\nPhysical violence, such as being attacked, mugged, etc.\nPhysical abuse, such as excessive physical discipline, intimate partner violence, etc.\nPhysical trauma such as accidents, illness with sudden onset, etc.\nSexual violence such as rape, sexual assault, etc.\nSexual abuse, such as the sexual grooming of minors, prolonged threat of sexual violence or manipulation, stalking, human trafficking, etc.\nVerbal and emotional abuse\nSudden loss of a loved one\nEmotional or interpersonal abuse, such as yelling, emotional manipulation, controlling behaviors, etc.\nHomelessness or housing instability\n[10]\nExtreme financial distress\nManufactured conflicts such as armed conflict, civilian exposure to war, relief work, refugeeism, terrorism, and torture.\nChronic illness\nExperiencing bullying\nReal or perceived neglect or abandonment\nWitnessing others experiencing any of the above\n\nOther factors influence the impact of trauma on an individual’s well-being by either predisposing or precipitating trauma responses. Such factors include:\n\nGender\n[11]\nAge\n[12]\nSocioeconomic factors\n[13]\nRace, ethnicity, and culture\n[14]\nSexual orientation and gender identity\n[15]\nTime to adequately process the trauma experience\n[16]\nLosses secondary to trauma, such as losing an important relationship, job, stable housing, etc.\nAnticipation of trauma exposure\n[17]\n[18]\nRelationship to the person or entity responsible for trauma exposure\n[19]\nPerceived individual or cultural meaning of trauma\n[20]\nDisruption of core assumptions and beliefs\n[21]\nPrior trauma history\n[22]\nHistory of resilience\n[23]\nHistory of mental illness\n[24]",
    "monitoring": "Physicians and clinicians should complete a full evaluation and assessment to rule out organic pathology that may exacerbate or complicate treatment, such as liver disease and other conditions that may influence drug metabolism or drug-drug interactions.\n[46]\nCurrently, cortisol levels, dexamethasone suppression testing, and other neuroendocrine tests are not routinely performed. Substance use disorders, including alcohol and tobacco, often coexist with trauma and should be screened for during the initial evaluation.\n\nAlthough no recommended guidelines exist, screening for trauma history consistently is advisable. This is especially true for patients presenting with psychiatric complaints consistent with depression and anxiety or with a history that increases the risk of trauma exposure, such as military service.\n[46]\nDetermining the level of impairment in various aspects of a patient’s life is essential in determining the presence of ASD or PTSD.\n\nPractitioners may utilize several screening and diagnostic tools to aid in assessing trauma-associated pathology. Several psychometrically sound assessments and tools are available, many of which are self-report or short structured interviews. The following tools are available in the public domain:\n\nScreen for Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms (SPTSS)\n[47]\nClinician-administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5)\n[48]\nImpact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R)\n[49]\nPTSD Symptom Scale: Self-report Version (PSS-SR)\n[50]\nTrauma History Questionnaire (THQ)\n[51]\n\nSPTSS, IES-R, and PSS-SR are self-report assessments that patients can quickly complete. SPTSS is frequently used to assess if patients meet criteria for PTSD that do not depend upon identifying a particular stressor, whereas IES-R is used as a screener only. The PSS-SR is also a screener that focuses on the level of dysfunction across core trauma-associated symptoms. The THQ is specially designed to facilitate the description of multiple traumatic events across the lifespan and elucidate complicated trauma histories. CAPS-5 is a structured interview and is considered the gold standard for diagnosing PTSD, given its in-depth exploration of various aspects of trauma-associated symptoms, including duration, severity, and timing.\n\nIn general, research finds that using structured clinical interviews yields more accurate diagnoses of trauma-associated disorders but at the cost of additional time burden and training to perform appropriately.\n[52]\nScreening and assessment tools are helpful adjuncts in screening at-risk individuals but do not replace a thorough medical and mental health evaluation.",
    "administration": "Therapy is the mainstay treatment for trauma-associated symptoms and pathologies like ASD and PTSD. Multiple randomized controlled studies completed with child, adolescent, and adult populations have found that most psychotherapeutic modalities show efficacy compared to control groups.\n[53]\nCurrent evidence suggests that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can reduce symptoms of PTSD and comorbid anxiety and depression in children and adolescents regardless of trauma type.\n[53]\n\nAdditional treatment modalities such as cognitive processing therapy (CPT) and exposure therapy are equally effective in treating general PTSD and PTSD specifically related to interpersonal physical and sexual violence.\n[54]\nStress inoculation training appears to have some efficacy in reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms compared to waitlist control, with the maintenance of benefits up to a year after discontinuation.\n[55]\nEye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is a commonly used therapeutic modality effective in addressing trauma and PTSD.\n[56]\nPsychodynamic psychotherapy has also demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of PTSD.\n[57]\n[58]\n\nThe goal of therapy is to assist patients in identifying and managing maladaptive cognitions, affect, and behaviors to reduce avoidance behaviors, extinguish autonomic psychological responses, and develop greater overall function. Each psychotherapy technique approaches this treatment goal using differing theoretical formulations.\n\nThe mainstay of pharmacological treatment for trauma-related conditions includes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI). Currently, the only FDA-approved medications for PTSD treatment are the SSRIs paroxetine and sertraline. However, the SSRI fluoxetine and the SNRI venlafaxine are also frequently prescribed; both are recommended by the Veteran Affairs/Department of Defense (VA/DoD) Clinical Practice Guidelines.\n[59]\n[60]\nOther non-SSRI antidepressants, such as trazodone and mirtazapine, have also shown benefits for the treatment of PTSD, along with several monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs).\n[61]\n\nStudies of antidepressants in animals have demonstrated hippocampal neurogenesis, a hypothesized mechanism of action in PTSD.\n[35]\nAntipsychotics such as quetiapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole and mood-stabilizing agents such as topiramate have shown clinical benefits.\n[62]\n[63]\nHowever, the increased burden of adverse effects can limit the utility of these medications.\n[3]\n[59]\nMultiple clinical investigations have indicated that a combination of trauma-informed psychotherapeutic and pharmacologic interventions has beneficial and possibly synergistic effects; this remains unclear and will require additional study.\n[3]\n[64]\n\nResearch has been undertaken to determine psychopharmacological and therapeutic approaches to preventing the development of trauma-associated symptoms and diagnoses. A recent literature review by Qi et al suggests that brief psychotherapeutic interventions are likely unnecessary or inappropriate for most symptomatic trauma survivors.\n[65]\nAdditionally, hydrocortisone has shown some efficacy as a preventative treatment, especially for those who are corticosteroid naive, but no efficacy has been demonstrated for escitalopram, gabapentin, propranolol, or temazepam.\n[66]\nNew treatment avenues utilizing hallucinogenic substances have shown some promise in clinical trials but will require further investigation to establish safety and efficacy profiles in clinical practice.\n[67]",
    "adverse_effects": "Research has shown that individuals who experience acute or chronic trauma are at risk of developing poor health outcomes. A recent extensive literature review of various health outcomes showed that acute stress responses are associated with increased risks of all-cause mortality, healthcare service utilization, pain, and poor physical health.\n[32]\nAdditionally, other risks show increased rates of injury, cardiovascular disease through a wide variety of secondary risk factors, and greater use of medical and mental health services.\n[77]\n\nA diagnosis of PTSD is associated with myriad poor health outcomes, including poor physical health, a greater number of medical diagnoses, and functional impairment that can develop years after an initial trauma complicated by prolonged trauma responses.\n[78]\nCumulative victimization traumas are associated with a worsened subjective sense of well-being and life satisfaction positively correlated to the severity of traumas sustained.\n[79]\nThis was brought to the forefront of trauma research with the landmark study by Felittie et al in which a survey of more than 16,000 adults showed a positive correlation between the number of traumatic events across the lifespan and significant adverse health outcomes.\n[80]\n\nAdverse childhood experiences include potentially traumatic events such as abuse, neglect, and loss of a caregiver that occur during developmentally vital periods like childhood and adolescence.\n[3]\n[80]\n[75]\nCurrent evidence suggests that repeated childhood trauma exposures have significant implications for coping skills, attachment styles, personality development, and increased risk for further trauma and the development of psychiatric illness. Severe acute emotional reactions or distress experienced following trauma exposure accompanied by significant autonomic activation appears to predict the development of PTSD.\n[5]\n\nThis initial response and subsequent avoidant coping behaviors are associated with increased PTSD symptom burden. This finding was the basis for establishing acute debrief protocols that were eventually not found beneficial and, in some instances, appeared to exacerbate peritraumatic symptoms.\n[35]\nCurrent medical literature makes a strong case that chronic childhood stress is associated with disrupted early attachments, poor acquisition of adaptive coping skills, heightened HPA axis response, and a markedly elevated risk of developing psychiatric illness in adulthood.\n[5]\nMoreover, chronic childhood trauma is associated with worsened academic performance mediated by mental illness that is pronounced by barriers to appropriate mental health care; this is associated with an increased risk of reduced employment and educational opportunities.\n[81]\n\nThe literature describing the association of sexual and physical violence with various poor health outcomes is extensive. In general, sexual trauma and nonsexual physical violence are associated with the more symptomatic presentation of PTSD and lifetime trauma types compared to other trauma types.\n[82]\nNonsexual physical violence is associated with comorbid substance use disorder in approximately 25% to 45% of PTSD cases.\n[83]\nThe unexpected death of a loved one was associated with comorbid depression. In all cases, developing depressive symptoms with and without PTSD is common, especially following high acute stress responses.\n[32]\n\nTrauma exposure is strongly associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts across the lifespan.\n[30]\nThis finding is true of childhood trauma exposure, which increases the risk of later developing suicidal ideation in children and adults, especially with sexual trauma. Trauma responses appear to be influenced by gender. For example, male military members with a history of any childhood trauma, especially sexual abuse, significantly increased the likelihood of presenting to the hospital for attempting suicide instead of suicidal ideation; females are more likely to take their own life if exposed to childhood neglect, particularly emotional neglect.\n[30]\n\nCurrent research indicates a strong association between trauma exposure and the risk of later developing psychotic symptoms, including chronic auditory and visual hallucinations. One study by Medjkane found that the number of hallucinatory modalities that patients experienced was a statistically significant predictor of childhood trauma after controlling for suicidal ideation and comorbid diagnoses.\n[84]\nAdditionally, exposure to at least 1 traumatic event led to a 2.5 increased risk of developing paranoid ideations and a nearly five-fold increase in developing verbal hallucinations.\n[85]\n\nThese risks were associated with severe childhood sexual abuse and non-victimization or witnessed events; only sustaining a physical attack as an adult was not associated with an increased risk of developing these symptoms. A recent meta-analysis of hallucinations and delusions associated with trauma also found that hallucination severity is associated with specific trauma types, which included childhood sexual abuse and neglect; the severity of delusions is associated with childhood sexual abuse and total trauma sustained.\n[72]\nNegative symptoms of psychosis, such as alogia, limited social interactions, and flat affect, were found to be associated with childhood neglect."
