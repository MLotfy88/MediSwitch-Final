    "indications": "Ocular hypotony is a potentially vision-threatening condition.\n[1]\nIt can be acute or chronic. Though controversy exists regarding the cut-off intraocular pressure (IOP) for the definition of hypotony, it is generally considered as an average IOP of 5 mm Hg or less measured at least three times.\n[2]\nHypotony has also been defined as an IOP less than 6.5mmHg.\n[3]\n\nOcular hypotony can be clinical or non-clinical, depending on the occurrence of clinical features. It is not clear who will develop clinical signs of hypotony, and some patients can tolerate long periods of hypotony without loss of vision. Yet others develop features of keratopathy, maculopathy, and even choroidal effusion. Management depends on the identification and treatment of the cause. With timely diagnosis and prompt management, an excellent final visual outcome is possible in most cases with ocular hypotony.",
    "mechanism": "In general, ocular hypotony occurs following multiple causes, including a leak of intraocular fluid through ocular surgical wounds, reduction in aqueous humor production, use of some topical or systemic medications, and proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). Hypotony occurs due to loss of aqueous humor which can be external following surgery and trauma or internal in cyclodialysis cleft or rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.\n[4]\n\nThe most common clinical scenario for ocular hypotony is after filtration surgery for glaucoma (trabeculectomy), especially following the use of adjuvant antimetabolites such as mitomycin C (MMC) or 5 fluorouracil (5FU) to prevent postoperative fibrosis.\n[5]\nFigure 1\nis a photograph of an eye showing leakage of aqueous from the anterior chamber through an atrophic cystic bleb several years after a trabeculectomy. There is a positive Seidel test in the upper frame of the photograph. The lower frame of the picture shows cessation of aqueous leakage and a negative Seidel test after revision of the filtering bleb. Other causes of ocular hypotony include intraocular inflammation, trauma, and other forms of ocular surgery such as vitreoretinal surgery.\n[3]\n[4]\n\nA good understanding of aqueous humor dynamics is essential to determine the etiology of ocular hypotony.\n[6]\n[7]\nAqueous humor is produced by the non-pigmented cells of the ciliary epithelium of the ciliary processes and is responsible for the maintenance of the intraocular pressure. Most of the aqueous humor, about 80%, is actively secreted by the ciliary processes, while the remaining is passively produced by ultrafiltration and diffusion.\n[8]\n\nNormally the aqueous humor is secreted into the posterior chamber from where it passes through the pupil into the anterior chamber and baths the avascular structures, i.e., crystalline lens and cornea, acting as a surrogate for blood by providing much-needed oxygen and nutrients and removing the waste. Aqueous exits from the anterior chamber through the trabecular meshwork and the uveoscleral pathway. Therefore, causes of ocular hypotony can be broadly categorized into two, as indicated below. In addition, some systemic medications can result in ocular hypotony.\n\nDecreased Aqueous Humor Production\n\nIntraocular inflammation\nHypoperfusion\nDrug-induced (use of topical or systemic aqueous humor suppressants)\nReduced ciliary body perfusion (ocular ischemic syndrome)\nScarring or traction to the ciliary body, e.g., following trauma, proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), chronic uveitis\nCyclodestructive procedure\n\nIncreased Aqueous Humor Drainage\n\nGlaucoma filtering surgery\nGlaucoma drainage devices\nAngle-based surgery\nIatrogenic creation of cyclodialysis cleft.\nPost-traumatic open globe injury\nSequestration into intraocular spaces, such as in rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and cyclodialysis cleft\nOther surgeries, e.g., vitreoretinal surgery; corneal surgery (including full-thickness cornea transplant, corneal tear repair, and keratoprosthesis), scleral-fixated intraocular lens\n\nSystemic Medications\n\nCarbonic anhydrase inhibitors acetazolamide and methazolamide\nAntihypertensive drugs, e.g., clonidine, beta-blockers\nNitrates\nAntivirals like Cidofovir\nHyperosmotic agents, e.g., mannitol\n\nSystemic Causes\n\nPregnancy\nDehydration\nUremia\nDiabetic coma\nCongenital weakness of the sclera, e.g., Marfan syndrome\nOther hereditary diseases, e.g., Myotonic dystrophy\n\nMore than one mechanism may account for the ocular hypotony in some cases. For instance, after glaucoma filtering surgery, hypotony may be because of over filtration of the surgical bleb or leakage from the bleb or elsewhere in the surgical wound. Hypotony after glaucoma surgery could also be due to mitomycin toxicity to the ciliary body.\n[9]\n\nCareful examination is required to determine the exact mechanism of the postoperative hypotony as the management of each of these causes differs considerably. In the same light, after trauma, hypotony could arise from any of the following, open globe injury, cyclodialysis, ciliary body detachment, retinal detachment, and iridocyclitis. Rahman et al. have categorized the causes of post-glaucoma filtering surgery ocular hypotony based on postoperative timing as a. early and b. chronic. The causes of early postoperative hypotony after glaucoma surgery include the following:\n[10]\n\nOver-filtration\nWound leak\nReduced aqueous production\nCiliochoroidal detachment\nRetinal detachment\nGlobe perforation\nIridocyclitis\n\nMultiple causes can lead to chronic postoperative hypotony, including the following:\n\nLeaks in the conjunctiva\nOver-functioning bleb (excessive filtration)\nAvascular thin cystic bleb\nCyclodialysis cleft\nCiliary body detachment\nRetinal detachment\nCiliary body atrophy\nCyclitic membrane\n\nLastly, some systemic conditions can be associated with bilateral ocular hypotony, including dehydration, uremia, diabetic coma, myotonic dystrophy, and pregnancy. Systemically administered medications, as listed above, can be associated with ocular hypotony.",
    "monitoring": "Ocular hypotony is primarily a clinical diagnosis. In all cases of hypotony, an open wound or leak should be ruled out. Seidel test is beneficial in this regard. Other diagnostic procedures help outline ocular anatomy when evaluating a case of ocular hypotony and provide information on the etiology and presence of severe ocular hypotony.\n[3]\n\nAn instance of this is the use of ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM). UBM uses an ultrasonic probe of 35 MHz or 50 MHz. The 35 MHz probes are used to evaluate the ciliary body as they can visualize deeper structures compared to the 50 MHz one. UBM helps assess the anterior chamber depth, image a shallow or flat anterior chamber, and the forward bowing of the iris seen in a situation of hypotony. The UBM can also image the ciliary body and reveal clinically missed cyclodialysis, atrophy, membrane over the ciliary body, detachment of the ciliary body, and intraocular foreign body.\n[24]\n[25]\n\nThe choroidal effusion present in some cases of severe ocular hypotony can be imaged with a B (brightness) mode ultrasound scan. The B scan can also show the presence of a choroidal or retinal detachment when the fundal view is not entirely clear.\n\nA choroidal detachment in a postoperative hypotonic eye can be seen in the B scan in\nfigure 2\n. Similarly, for the imaging and evaluation of retinal and choroidal folds, fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), optical coherence tomography, and optical coherence tomography angiography can be utilized.\n[26]\n\nOn FFA, choroidal folds appear as alternating hyper fluorescence and hypo fluorescence bands. Hyperfluorescent crests appear due to atrophy of the RPE, while the troughs are hypo fluorescent. Disc swelling associated with hypotony could demonstrate features of leakage on FFA. Spectral-domain OCT is more sensitive than fundus photographs in diagnosing hypotony maculopathy and can detect folds in the presence of normal eye examination.\n[27]\n\nIndocyanine Green Angiography (ICG) can also be used to image choroidal folds in situations of ocular hypotony and could detect folds missed by FFA.\n[28]",
    "administration": "The treatment of ocular hypotony can be medical or surgical. Management of ocular hypotony depends on the cause, as outlined above. A good history and physical examination will usually reveal the cause and direct the treatment. The treatment could be relatively straightforward, such as discontinuing a specific culprit medication, surgical repair of a leaking globe injury, or more complicated with uncertain outcomes such as revising a bleb (demonstrated in\nfigure 1\n) or repairing a large cyclodialysis cleft.\n\nThe goals of treating ocular hypotony depend on the cause and clinical impact of ocular hypotony. They include reversing the causative pathology, maintaining the anatomical integrity of the eye, and restoring any compromised visual function.\n[3]\nWith this in mind, these principles can be applied to a clinician's diverse clinical scenarios.\n\nMedical/Conservative Treatment\n\nOcular hypotony is commonly observed after filtering surgery and may result from a leaking bleb or over filtration. A large diameter (14 mm) bandage contact lens encourages epithelial migration and wound healing; this effectively manages early bleb leaks.\n[29]\n[30]\n\nOther options for managing a leaking bleb include cyanoacrylate glue, autologous blood injection, and compression sutures.\n[31]\nCyanoacrylate glue is applied to the defective edge of the leaking conjunctival tissue but not into the bleb.\n\nUveitis-induced ocular hypotony is reported to occur after noninfectious and infectious uveitis.\n[32]\nThe risk of ocular hypotony is higher after anterior uveitis and panuveitis. A diversity of mechanisms can be responsible for uveitis-induced ocular hypotony. This includes but is not limited to the following: acute ciliary shutdown leading to decreased aqueous production, ciliary body detachment (which can be induced by tractional membranes or serous ciliochoroidal effusion), atrophy of the ciliary processes, and in some cases, increased uveoscleral outflow. To manage the uveitis-induced acute ocular hypotony, aggressive, timely treatment of the active inflammation is essential to restore vision and prevent ocular complications.\n\nOptions for treatment include systemic corticosteroids, systemic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, a topical steroid (including prednisolone acetate, difluprednate) and non-steroid, and local injection of steroids (including posterior subtenon triamcinolone, peribulbar/transseptal triamcinolone/methylprednisolone). In some cases, systemic immunomodulatory agents could be used to manage the primary inflammatory condition. Corticosteroid therapy can be used with good effect if the cause of hypotony is associated with intraocular inflammation and shuts down the production of aqueous by the ciliary processes.\n[32]\n\nCorticosteroids also work by inducing a change in the extracellular matrix of the trabecular meshwork. Cycloplegic agents (including atropine) help treat ocular hypotony and provide posterior rotation of the ciliary processes, maintaining the anterior chamber depth. Topical ibopamine 2% has been used twice daily, with reports of good effect in treating patients suffering from chronic ocular hypotony attributable to vitreoretinal surgery, uveitis, and penetrating trauma.\n[33]\n\nInjection of an ophthalmic viscosurgical device (OVD) has been used to treat ocular hypotony.\n[34]\nIntracameral injections of OVDs are often employed postoperatively to treat or prevent flat anterior chambers. Severe intraocular pressure rise has been documented as a complication of this procedure.\n[34]\n\nOther reported complications of intracameral OVD injection include the need for severe inflammation, repeated OVD injections, and Descemet membrane detachment. It is recommended that OVDs with greater cohesiveness and viscosity be used for this purpose as they have better anterior chamber stabilization.\n\nCidofovir is an example of a systemic medication that can induce ocular hypotony and anterior uveitis.\n[35]\nCidofovir is used for treating Cytomegalovirus retinitis in immunocompromised patients, including AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).\n[36]\n\nIt is usually used as an intravenous infusion; however, topical and intravitreal preparations have also been used.\n[37]\nThe use of cidofovir can result in ocular hypotony and severe uveitis with hypopyon simulating endophthalmitis. Therefore, cidofovir therapy necessitates slit-lamp surveillance, especially in patients on HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy). Cidofovir-related uveitis requires a local steroid treatment. In situations of clinical hypotony, cidofovir should be withdrawn. In one report on intravenous cidofovir, a significant number of patients developed anterior uveitis.\n[36]\n\nThe cellular anterior chamber activity resolved with topical corticosteroid administration in all eyes with uveitis, but some patients had a significant flare that persisted despite topical steroids. Posterior synechiae responded poorly to topical mydriatic therapy—visually significant hypotony maculopathy developed in a minority of patients.\n\nThe same authors advised that cidofovir should be discontinued in favor of an alternative anti-cytomegaloviral agent when ocular hypotony occurs. In another report, two patients developed severe cidofovir-related hypotony, necessitating discontinuation of therapy. They were treated successfully with Ibopamine 2% eye drops combined with dexamethasone 0.1% eyedrops.\n[38]\n\nSurgical Treatment\n\nIn general, the surgical treatment of ocular hypotony is instituted when the conservative approach has not been successful, apart from cases that require immediate surgery, such as the repair of a globe perforation or retinal detachment. The excision and revision of a leaking bleb may be required using either the conjunctival advancement approach or a free conjunctival autograft.\n[39]\n\nAb Interno partial tube ligation has been used as an effective surgical option to achieve an immediate, predictable, and sustained intraocular pressure increase either as a primary procedure or after the failure of conventional methods to resolve hypotony in eyes with non-valved glaucoma drainage devices (GDDs).\n[40]\n\nPrompt resolution of the hypotony often results in normalization of retinal anatomy. Other surgical treatments for ocular hypotony include the repair of a retinal detachment and cyclodialysis cleft.\n\nTraction-induced ciliary body detachment is a cause of ocular hypotony, and it is associated with proliferative vitreoretinopathy, uveitis, and trauma. The use of silicone oil in vitreoretinal surgery for PVR or recurrent retinal detachments and chronic uveitis has improved ocular hypotony.\n[41]\nThe excision of portions of the anterior retinal flap following a broad retinectomy is protective against PVR-induced postoperative hypotony.\n[42]\nThe foldable capsular vitreous body was developed in China to treat severe retinal detachments and after severe ocular trauma to prevent phthisis.\n\nThe dissection of membranes from the ciliary body (through direct visualization or endoscopic viewing) also promotes recovery of the ciliary body and therefore improves aqueous production. Gürelik et al. have reported a simple technique for treating ocular hypotension post glaucoma filtering surgery and vitreoretinal surgery.\n[43]\n\nThis surgical technique increases the resistance to aqueous outflow by placing a capsular tension ring (CTR) in the iridocorneal angle through a cornea incision. They treated 13 eyes that suffered from chronic severe hypotony using this technique, with a follow-up of at least one year, and reported an improvement in all treated eyes. This surgical technique is remarkable considering the ease with which the surgery can be performed, and the authors reported no surgical complications.\n\nOcular Ischemic Syndrome (OIS) is associated with ocular hypoperfusion and hypotrophy of the ciliary body. This eventually results in decreased aqueous production and chronic hypotony. The primary cause of OIS is atherosclerosis. But it could be due to giant cell arteritis, carotid artery disease, Behçet disease, trauma, and inflammation. Management of OIS is by a multidisciplinary team consisting of a cardiologist, neurologist, and ophthalmologist. The goal is to improve or restore ocular blood perfusion.\n\nIn line with the treatment goals, complications of ocular hypotony can be successfully treated using surgical techniques. A good example is the report of successful treatment of hypotony maculopathy using vitrectomy for non-resolving chorioretinal folds.\n[44]\nAlso, peeling of the internal limiting membrane has been shown to release the subclinical traction from proliferating fibrocellular membranes. Perfluorocarbon liquid has also been used to treat chorioretinal folds.\n[44]\n\nBefore removing silicone oil, possible persistent postoperative hypotony or phthisis should be considered, especially in eyes with an IOP of 10 mm Hg or less in silicone oil-filled eyes.",
    "adverse_effects": "Ocular hypotony can be transient with limited risk to the eye. But in some instances, it can evolve into a more chronic situation with significant and devastating effects on the eye and vision, such as evolution to phthisis bulbi.\n[52]\n[53]\n\nOften, the complications of hypotony may co-exist with the primary pathology responsible for the hypotony. For instance, in the setting of trauma, complications of ocular hypotony may be associated with other features of trauma, which may result in disorganization of the globe. In uveitis, anterior and posterior synechia, macular edema, and cataract may also co-exist with hypotony and its effects.\n[54]\n\nComplications specific to ocular hypotony include hypotony maculopathy with characteristics described in the earlier sections on pathophysiology. Other complications include choroidal detachment, hypotony keratopathy, refractive change, papilledema, and cataract formation.\n[15]\n[16]\n[55]\n\nTreatment of these complications of ocular hypotony can result in a favorable response with improvement in vision."
