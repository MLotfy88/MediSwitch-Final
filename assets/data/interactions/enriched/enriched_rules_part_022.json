Ginkgo products may contain varying amounts of 4'-O-methylpyridoxine (ginkgotoxin), a known neurotoxin found primarily in ginkgo biloba seeds but also detected in lesser amounts in the leaves. In vivo, 4'-O-methylpyridoxine competes with vitamin B6, which causes an indirect inhibition of glutamate decarboxylase and subsequent decrease in the formation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain. There have been published case reports of generalized convulsions and vomiting within several hours after ingestion of large amounts of ginkgo nuts/seeds, including in young children and healthy individuals with no known personal or family history of epilepsy.",
