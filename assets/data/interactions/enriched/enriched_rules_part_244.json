For SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) vaccines, vaccination should preferably be completed at least two weeks before initiation or resumption of immunosuppressive therapies; however, decisions to delay or temporarily withhold immunosuppressive therapy to complete COVID-19 vaccination should consider the individual's risks relative to their underlying condition.  Additional shots and/or boosters may be appropriate depending on age, prior COVID-19 vaccine formulation(s) received, and other factors in individuals with moderate to severe immune compromise due to medical conditions or immunosuppressive medications or treatments (e.g., solid organ transplant recipients on immunosuppressive therapy; patients on active treatment for solid tumor and hematologic malignancies).

For rabies vaccine, some authorities suggest that immunosuppressive agents should generally be avoided during postexposure therapy except when absolutely necessary for the treatment of other conditions.  For SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) vaccines, vaccination should preferably be completed at least two weeks before initiation or resumption of immunosuppressive therapies; however, decisions to delay or temporarily withhold immunosuppressive therapy to complete COVID-19 vaccination should consider the individual's risks relative to their underlying condition.  Additional shots and/or boosters may be appropriate depending on age, prior COVID-19 vaccine formulation(s) received, and other factors in individuals with moderate to severe immune compromise due to medical conditions or immunosuppressive medications or treatments (e.g., solid organ transplant recipients on immunosuppressive therapy; patients on active treatment for solid tumor and hematologic malignancies).

Patients should be advised to avoid sun exposure, even through window glass or cloud cover, for at least 8 hours after methoxsalen ingestion and during the 24 hours following photochemotherapy or photopheresis treatment.  Protective devices should be used if sun exposure cannot be avoided, such as a hat and gloves and/or sunscreens containing ingredients that filter out UVA radiation (e.g., benzophenone and/or PABA esters).  Sunscreens must be applied to all areas that might be exposed to the sun, including the lips.  For the treatment of psoriasis, sunscreens should not be applied to areas affected by psoriasis until after treatment in the UVA chamber.  In addition, UVA-absorbing wrap-around sunglasses should be worn during daylight for 24 hours after methoxsalen ingestion and during the 24 hours following photochemotherapy or photopheresis treatment to prevent the irreversible binding of methoxsalen to proteins and DNA components of the lens, which can lead to formation of cataracts.  The glasses should be worn any time patients are exposed to direct or indirect sunlight, whether they are outdoors or exposed through a window.

However, higher dosages, more frequent boosters, and/or serological testing may be required in some cases.  Local guidelines and prescribing information for individual vaccines should be consulted.  For Haemophilus influenzae b vaccine, some experts recommend that it be administered at least 2 weeks before starting or 3 months after discontinuing chemotherapy when used in patients with Hodgkin's disease.  For rabies vaccine, some authorities suggest that immunosuppressive agents should generally be avoided during postexposure therapy except when absolutely necessary for the treatment of other conditions.  For SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) vaccines, vaccination should preferably be completed at least two weeks before initiation or resumption of immunosuppressive therapies; however, decisions to delay or temporarily withhold immunosuppressive therapy to complete COVID-19 vaccination should consider the individual's risks relative to their underlying condition.  Additional shots and/or boosters may be appropriate depending on age, prior COVID-19 vaccine formulation(s) received, and other factors in individuals with moderate to severe immune compromise due to medical conditions or immunosuppressive medications or treatments (e.g., solid organ transplant recipients on immunosuppressive therapy; patients on active treatment for solid tumor and hematologic malignancies).

For Haemophilus influenzae b vaccine, some experts recommend that it be administered at least 2 weeks before starting or 3 months after discontinuing chemotherapy when used in patients with Hodgkin's disease.  For rabies vaccine, some authorities suggest that immunosuppressive agents should generally be avoided during postexposure therapy except when absolutely necessary for the treatment of other conditions.  For SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) vaccines, vaccination should preferably be completed at least two weeks before initiation or resumption of immunosuppressive therapies; however, decisions to delay or temporarily withhold immunosuppressive therapy to complete COVID-19 vaccination should consider the individual's risks relative to their underlying condition.  Additional shots and/or boosters may be appropriate depending on age, prior COVID-19 vaccine formulation(s) received, and other factors in individuals with moderate to severe immune compromise due to medical conditions or immunosuppressive medications or treatments (e.g., solid organ transplant recipients on immunosuppressive therapy; patients on active treatment for solid tumor and hematologic malignancies).  Vaccines may generally be administered to patients receiving corticosteroids as replacement therapy (e.g., for Addison's disease).", "mechanism_text": "Others", "recommendation": "In general, the U.", "risk_level": "Moderate", "type": "pharmacodynamic", "metabolism_info": null, "source_url": "https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/287381/", "reference_text": "[1] \"Product Information.

For treatment of latent tuberculosis (TB) infection, a nine-month regimen of isoniazid may be considered if feasible.  For treatment of HIV-related TB, a regimen that includes rifabutin is generally preferred, as rifabutin appears to be as effective as rifampin but is a much less potent inducer of CYP450 3A4.  Nonrifamycin-containing regimens may be suboptimal (higher mortality rates; higher rates of treatment failure and relapse; increased adverse effects; longer treatment duration) and are usually not recommended for HIV-related TB except in patients who are intolerant of rifamycins or infected with a rifamycin-resistant isolate.  In patients who have not begun antiretroviral therapy at the time TB treatment is initiated, clinicians may also consider using rifampin and postponing antiretroviral therapy.  With early HIV disease, it may be reasonable to monitor CD4 cell count and postpone antiretroviral therapy until TB treatment is complete, since there is low risk of HIV disease progression or death during this period.  However, the optimal time for starting antiretroviral therapy should be individualized based on initial response to TB treatment and occurrence of side effects.  In patients with low CD4 cell counts, clinicians may consider delaying antiretroviral therapy until after the first one or two months of TB therapy, as side effects are common during this multi-drug phase of TB treatment and may overlap with those of antiretroviral medications.  Moreover, delaying antiretroviral therapy may ameliorate adherence issues and decrease the frequency and severity of paradoxical reactions (i.e., immune restoration syndromes resembling exacerbation of TB that sometimes occur after initiation of antituberculosis treatment in patients receiving potent antiretroviral therapy).  Rifabutin can be substituted approximately 2 weeks before the planned initiation of antiretroviral therapy to allow time for rifampin's enzyme induction effects to wane.  In general, treatment of TB in the context of antiretroviral therapy is complex and requires an individualized approach.  Experts in the treatment of HIV-related tuberculosis should be consulted, and TB and HIV care providers should work in close coordination throughout treatment.", "mechanism_text": "Metabolism", "recommendation": "Given the risk of reduced viral susceptibility and resistance development associated with subtherapeutic antiretroviral drug levels, alternative antimycobacterial agents should be considered in patients already receiving effective antiretroviral therapy with lopinavir-ritonavir.", "risk_level": "Major", "type": "pharmacodynamic", "metabolism_info": null, "source_url": "https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/288513/", "reference_text": "[1] \"Product Information.
