      "text": "Method of enhanced elimination that uses multiple doses of activated charcoal\nNo evidence to suggest that MDAC decreases morbidity or mortality\nSome evidence shows that MDAC increases the elimination of certain drugs (further explained below)\nFunctions to prevents the absorption of xenobiotics that are slowly absorbed and to enhance the elimination of certain xenobiotics that have already been absorbed\nlarge amounts of xenobiotics ingested or dissolution is delayed (masses, bezoars)\nformulations that exhibit a delayed or prolonged release phase (enteric coated, extended release)\nGI motility is impaired\nprevent reabsoprtion (enterohepatic circulation of active xenobiotic or metabolite)",
