Serious infections including sepsis, as well as opportunistic infections like Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis, and aspergillosis have been reported with the use of leflunomide, particularly in patients on concomitant hematotoxic therapy. Agents that may be significantly immuno- or myelosuppressive include antineoplastic agents, radiation, zidovudine, linezolid, some antirheumatic agents, high dosages of corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic agents , and long-term topical or inhaled corticosteroids. Rare cases of pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia have also occurred with leflunomide alone, but were most frequent in the presence of concomitant or recent use of methotrexate or other myelotoxic agents. Due to the prolonged elimination half-life of leflunomide's active metabolite, an interaction may occur even when hematotoxic agents are initiated after the discontinuation of leflunomide. Administering a washout procedure with cholestyramine or activated charcoal helps to accelerate elimination of the active metabolite from plasma and reduce the overlap of systemic exposure to these agents.",

Patients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience potential signs and symptoms of hyponatremia such as nausea, vomiting, headache, malaise, lethargy, irritability, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, muscle spasm, and unsteadiness (which may lead to falls). More severe and/or acute cases may include hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. Discontinuation of SSRI/SNRI therapy should be considered in patients who develop symptomatic hyponatremia, and appropriate medical intervention instituted as necessary. Patients should also have their blood pressure and pulse monitored before and during SSRI/SNRI therapy, especially during the first few weeks and following a dosage increase. Patients should be advised to avoid rising abruptly from a sitting or recumbent position and to notify their doctor if they experience dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope, orthostasis, or tachycardia.",

These symptoms may be followed by sharp shooting pains or severe continuous burning pain if the drug is not withdrawn, and progress to severe pain requiring narcotic analgesics.

Since the development of peripheral neuropathy appears to be dose-related, the recommended dosage of zalcitabine should not be exceeded. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue zalcitabine therapy and contact their physician if neuropathy develops.

The initial dosage should be doubled for the next 2 weeks, then increased by 1.2 mg/kg/day or 100 mg/day every 1 to 2 weeks as needed and as tolerated. The usual maintenance dosage is 5 to 15 mg/kg/day (up to 400 mg/day) in children up to 12 years of age and 300 to 500 mg/day (400 mg/day for the treatment of bipolar disorder) in older patients. Patients should be advised to promptly notify their physician if they experience worsening of seizure control or increased adverse effects. A reevaluation of all antiepileptic agents in the regimen should be considered prior to making any changes. If the enzyme-inducing antiepileptic agent is discontinued, lamotrigine half-life will be prolonged and a dosage adjustment may be necessary.
