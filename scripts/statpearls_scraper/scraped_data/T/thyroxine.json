    "indications": "Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) is one of three major transport proteins, which are primarily responsible for binding to and transporting thyroid hormones to the necessary tissues.  The other two serum transport proteins include transthyretin and human serum albumin.  While there are higher amounts of albumin in serum, TBG has a greater affinity to thyroxine (T4).\n[1]\nAbnormalities in the functionality and amount of TBG can cause variations in the total amount of T4 in the serum, but not in the amount of bioactive free T4.  Since the amount of free T4 circulating in the serum remains the same, deficiency in thyroxine-binding globulin often does not lead to adverse metabolic effects seen in an individual with abnormal thyroid hormone levels.\n[2]\nHowever, it can cause errors in the interpretation of thyroid hormone labs, which can ultimately lead to inappropriate treatment.  This article illustrates the etiology, diagnosis, and management of thyroxine-binding globulin deficiency.",
    "mechanism": "Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) is a serine protease inhibitor produced in the liver. It belongs to the SERPINA7 family. The encoding gene for this protein is on the long arm of the X chromosome and as such, inherited forms of TBG tend to follow an X-linked pattern. Approximately 27 different mutations have been identified to play a role in the etiology of the inherited form of complete TBG deficiency thus far. These mutations seem to be caused by a nucleotide substation or by a frameshift.  Missense mutations have been the only type identified so far in an inherited form of partial TBG deficiency.\n[1]\n\nAcquired forms of TBG deficiency are attributable to degradation and altered synthesis of the molecule. Patients with hyperthyroidism have been found to have an increase in the rate of turnover of TBG.  In terminal illness, interleukin-6 seems to play a role in altering the levels of TBG. Levels of TBG have been found to vary with fluctuations in sex hormones as well.  For example, estrogen has been known to cause an increase in TBG, while androgens have been found to decrease levels TBG.\n[3]",
    "monitoring": "In cases of inherited thyroid binding globulin deficiency, the disorder is often picked up on the newborn screening during the evaluation of congenital hypothyroidism. The newborn screening often looks at either TSH, total T4, or both.   If the total T4 is below the serum cut off, the screen comes back as a positive result.\n[8]\nConfirmatory testing with TBG, free T4, and TSH help rule out congenital hypothyroidism and rule in the diagnosis of TBG deficiency.\n[9]\nThyroxine-binding globulin has been found to be present in the serum of a fetus as early as at 12 weeks gestation. The level of TBG is approximately 1.5 times that of an adult until adolescence at which point it starts to decrease.\n[10]\nAffected boys have been found to have mild, moderate and severe changes in thyroid hormone levels; whereas girls have been rarely found to have critical changes in thyroid hormone levels except in the instance of Turner syndrome. The normal level TBG in an adult male is 1.1 to 2.1 mg/dl.\n[3]\nIn a hemizygous male with complete TBG deficiency, TBG is found to be below 5 mg/L. In hemizygous females with partial TBG deficiency, serum levels of TBG are near normal.\n[1]\nTBG deficiency can also present as an incidental finding.  In such cases, if other causes of TBG deficiency are ruled out, suspicion for inherited TBG deficiency should be high and should prompt genetic testing for confirmation.",
    "administration": "Management of secondary illness, causing acquired TBG deficiency, may improve levels of TBG.  However, replacement with l-thyroxine is not required, as there is no change in the levels of metabolically active free T4 levels.",
    "adverse_effects": "Complications can arise from misinterpretation of total T4 levels. As such, iatrogenic symptoms and the manifestations of hyperthyroidism may occur as a result of inappropriate treatment with levothyroxine."
