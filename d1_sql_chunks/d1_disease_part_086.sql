Fluorinated corticosteroids such as betamethasone, dexamethasone, and triamcinolone appear to cause more severe muscle atrophy and weakness than the nonfluorinated agents.  Moreover, multiple-daily doses are more toxic than once-daily or, preferably, alternate-day morning doses.  Steroid myopathy is generalized and sometimes accompanied by respiratory weakness and dyspnea.  In some cases, it has resulted in quadriparesis.  Elevations of creatine kinase (CK) may also occur, albeit infrequently.  After withdrawal of corticosteroid therapy, recovery may be slow and incomplete.  Therapy with corticosteroids should be administered cautiously in patients with preexisting myopathy or myoneural disorders since these conditions may confound the diagnosis of steroid-induced myopathy.

Therapy with corticosteroids should be administered cautiously in patients with preexisting myopathy or myoneural disorders since these conditions may confound the diagnosis of steroid-induced myopathy.  The presence of a normal serum CK level, minimal/no changes of myopathy on electromyography, and type 2 muscle fiber atrophy on biopsy are helpful in suggesting steroid-induced weakness.  If steroid myopathy is suspected, a dosage reduction or discontinuation of the steroid should be considered.', '2', '"Product Information. Hydeltrasol (prednisolone)."
