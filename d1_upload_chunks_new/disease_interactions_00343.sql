Abnormal renal function may occur, which is usually reversible but may infrequently progress to tubular damage and acute renal failure.  Patients who are dehydrated may be at increased risk for nephrotoxicity from acyclovir administration.  Intravenous acyclovir should be administered over a one-hour period accompanied by adequate hydration.  The urine flow should be monitored, especially within the first two hours following infusion when maximum urine concentration occurs.  The recommended urine output is a minimum of 500 mL per gram of drug infused.', '2', '', 'DDInter', 0);
