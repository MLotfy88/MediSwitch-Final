Patients should be closely monitored for symptoms of the serotonin syndrome during treatment. Particular caution is advised when initiating or increasing the dosages of these agents. The potential risk for serotonin syndrome should be considered even when administering serotonergic agents sequentially, as some agents may demonstrate a prolonged elimination half-life. For example, a 5-week washout period is recommended following use of fluoxetine and 3 weeks following use of vortioxetine before administering another serotonergic agent such as sibutramine. At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of other serotonergic agents and initiation of treatment with sibutramine. If serotonin syndrome develops or is suspected during the course of therapy, all serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately and supportive care rendered as necessary. Moderately ill patients may also benefit from the administration of a serotonin antagonist (e.g., cyproheptadine, chlorpromazine).

Elderly patients and patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume-depleted may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SSRIs and SNRIs. Antihypertensive agents such as diuretics may potentiate the orthostatic effect that is occasionally observed upon the initiation of SSRI or SNRI therapy. Syncope and orthostatic hypotension tend to occur within the first week of SNRI/SSRI therapy but can occur at any time during treatment, particularly after a dosage increase. The use of SSRIs or SNRIs may also cause sustained increases in blood pressure and heart rate, which may antagonize the therapeutic effects of antihypertensive medications.", "source": "DDInter", "management_text": "Caution is recommended if SSRIs or SNRIs are prescribed in combination with diuretics, particularly in the elderly. Patients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience potential signs and symptoms of hyponatremia such as nausea, vomiting, headache, malaise, lethargy, irritability, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, muscle spasm, and unsteadiness (which may lead to falls). More severe and/or acute cases may include hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. Discontinuation of SSRI/SNRI therapy should be considered in patients who develop symptomatic hyponatremia, and appropriate medical intervention instituted as necessary. Patients should also have their blood pressure and pulse monitored before and during SSRI/SNRI therapy, especially during the first few weeks and following a dosage increase. Patients should be advised to avoid rising abruptly from a sitting or recumbent position and to notify their doctor if they experience dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope, orthostasis, or tachycardia.", "mechanism_text": "Synergism", "recommendation": "Caution is recommended if SSRIs or SNRIs are prescribed in combination with diuretics, particularly in the elderly.", "risk_level": "Moderate", "type": "pharmacodynamic", "metabolism_info": null, "source_url": "https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/192622/", "reference_text": "[1] \"Product Information.

Antihypertensive agents such as diuretics may potentiate the orthostatic effect that is occasionally observed upon the initiation of SSRI or SNRI therapy. Syncope and orthostatic hypotension tend to occur within the first week of SNRI/SSRI therapy but can occur at any time during treatment, particularly after a dosage increase. The use of SSRIs or SNRIs may also cause sustained increases in blood pressure and heart rate, which may antagonize the therapeutic effects of antihypertensive medications.", "source": "DDInter", "management_text": "Caution is recommended if SSRIs or SNRIs are prescribed in combination with diuretics, particularly in the elderly. Patients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience potential signs and symptoms of hyponatremia such as nausea, vomiting, headache, malaise, lethargy, irritability, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, muscle spasm, and unsteadiness (which may lead to falls). More severe and/or acute cases may include hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. Discontinuation of SSRI/SNRI therapy should be considered in patients who develop symptomatic hyponatremia, and appropriate medical intervention instituted as necessary. Patients should also have their blood pressure and pulse monitored before and during SSRI/SNRI therapy, especially during the first few weeks and following a dosage increase.

Postganglionic adrenergic blocking agents such as guanadrel, guanethidine, and rauwolfia alkaloids work by depleting catecholamine stores from adrenergic nerve endings. Therefore, they may sensitize adrenergic receptors to direct-acting sympathomimetics, but blunt the effects of indirect-acting agents whose activity is mediated through the release of catecholamines.", "source": "DDInter", "management_text": "Due to their pressor effect, sympathomimetic amines should be used cautiously in patients with hypertension. Alternatives to postganglionic adrenergic blocking agents should be considered if patients are treated with sympathomimetic amines, since effects of the latter may be intensified or diminished depending on whether they are direct- or indirect-acting. Most agents with indirect sympathomimetic activity are mixed-acting, thus it may be difficult to predict how they will be affected by postganglionic adrenergic blocking agents.
