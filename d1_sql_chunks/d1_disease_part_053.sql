Potassium and magnesium depletion may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.  Other electrolyte-related complications include metabolic alkalosis and hyponatremia, which are rarely life-threatening.  Excessive diuresis, as indicated by rapid weight loss, may induce dehydration and hypovolemia, which can result in acute hypotension, orthostasis, circulatory collapse, vascular thrombosis and embolism, and abrupt reduction in glomerular filtration and renal blood flow.  Severe dehydration is most likely to occur in the elderly and patients under prolonged sodium restriction.  Therapy with loop diuretics should be administered cautiously in patients with or predisposed to fluid and electrolyte depletion, including patients with primary or secondary aldosteronism (may have low potassium levels); those with severe or prolonged diarrhea or vomiting; and those with poor nutritional status.  Fluid and electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected before initiating therapy, and blood pressure as well as serum electrolyte concentrations monitored periodically and maintained at normal ranges during therapy.  Patients should be advised to immediately report signs and symptoms of fluid or electrolyte imbalance, including dry mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, arrhythmia, or gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting.  Digitalized patients and patients with a history of ventricular arrhythmias should be monitored carefully, since the development of hypokalemia may be particularly dangerous in these patients.  The risk of hypokalemia may be minimized by slow diuresis, a lower diuretic dosage, potassium supplementation, or combined use with a potassium-sparing diuretic.  Similarly, to prevent excessive dehydration and hyponatremia, sodium intake should be liberalized if clinically feasible.', '3', 'Tambyah JA, Lim MK "Effect of furesomide on calcium excretion."

Patients should be advised to immediately report signs and symptoms of fluid or electrolyte imbalance, including dry mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, arrhythmia, or gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting.  Digitalized patients and patients with a history of ventricular arrhythmias should be monitored carefully, since the development of hypokalemia may be particularly dangerous in these patients.  The risk of hypokalemia may be minimized by slow diuresis, a lower diuretic dosage, potassium supplementation, or combined use with a potassium-sparing diuretic.  Similarly, to prevent excessive dehydration and hyponatremia, sodium intake should be liberalized if clinically feasible.', '3', 'Tambyah JA, Lim MK "Effect of furesomide on calcium excretion."

Treatment with various quinolones has been associated with disturbances in blood glucose homeostasis possibly stemming from effects on pancreatic beta cell ATP-sensitive potassium channels that regulate insulin secretion.  However, dysglycemia has been reported more frequently with gatifloxacin than with other quinolones.  Although typically reported in diabetic patients, hypoglycemia and particularly hyperglycemia have occurred in patients without a history of diabetes.  Gatifloxacin-induced hypoglycemic episodes have generally occurred within the first 3 days of therapy and sometimes even after the first dose, while hyperglycemia usually occurred 4 to 10 days after initiation of therapy.  Serious cases have resulted in hyperosmolar nonketotic hyperglycemic coma, diabetic ketoacidosis, hypoglycemic coma, convulsions, and mental status changes.  Rarely, death has been reported.  In addition to diabetes, other risk factors associated with dysglycemia while taking gatifloxacin include older age, renal insufficiency, and concomitant glucose-altering mediations.  Patients with these risk factors should be closely monitored for glucose disturbances.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary, particularly in elderly patients who may have unrecognized diabetes, age-related decrease in renal function, and/or other underlying medical problems.  The manufacturer recommends a dosage reduction to 200 mg/daily after an initial dose of 400 mg in patients with creatinine clearance below 40 mL/min.  Patients should be counseled to recognize symptoms of hypoglycemia such as headache, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, tremor, weakness, hunger, excessive perspiration, and palpitations.  If hypo- or hyperglycemia occur during therapy, patients should initiate appropriate remedial therapy immediately, discontinue the antibiotic, and contact their physician.', '3', '"Product Information.

QT prolongation may potentiate the risk of ventricular arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and torsade de pointes.  The risk appears to be greatest with grepafloxacin and sparfloxacin (both are no longer marketed in the U.S.), although cardiovascular morbidity and mortality attributable to QT prolongation have also been reported rarely with others like gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin.  Reported cases have primarily occurred in patients with advanced age, cardiac disease, electrolyte disturbances, and/or underlying medical problems for which they were receiving concomitant medications known to prolong the QT interval.  Therapy with quinolones should be avoided in patients with known QT prolongation and/or uncorrected electrolyte disorders (hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia) and in patients treated concomitantly with class IA or III antiarrhythmic agents.  Cautious use with ECG monitoring is advised in patients with other proarrhythmic conditions such as clinically significant bradycardia, congestive heart failure, acute myocardial ischemia, and atrial fibrillation.  As QT prolongation may be a concentration-dependent effect, it is important that the recommended dosages or infusion rates of these drugs not be exceeded, particularly in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment.', '3', 'Jaillon P, Morganroth J, Brumpt I, Talbot G "Overview of electrocardiographic and cardiovascular safety data for sparfloxacin.
