Patients should be closely monitored for symptoms of the serotonin syndrome during treatment. Particular caution is warranted when initiating or increasing the dosages of these agents. The potential risk for serotonin syndrome should be considered even when administering serotonergic agents sequentially, as some agents may demonstrate a prolonged elimination half-life. For example, a 5-week washout period is typically recommended following use of fluoxetine and 2 weeks following use of MAOIs before administering another serotonergic agent. If serotonin syndrome develops or is suspected during the course of therapy, all serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately and supportive care rendered as necessary.', 'Synergism', NULL, NULL, 'Major', NULL, 'DDInter', 'pharmacodynamic', NULL, 'https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/148029/', '[1] "Product Information.
