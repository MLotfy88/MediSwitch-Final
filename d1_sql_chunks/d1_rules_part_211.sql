These drugs may increase the risk of hypoglycemia by enhancing insulin sensitivity (ACE inhibitors, fibrates, ginseng); stimulating insulin secretion (salicylates, NSAIDs, disopyramide, quinine, quinidine, MAOIs, ginseng); decreasing insulin clearance and resistance (4-aminoquinolines); increasing peripheral glucose utilization (SSRIs, insulin-like growth factor); inhibiting gluconeogenesis (SSRIs, MAOIs, insulin-like growth factor); slowing the rate of gastric emptying (amylin analogs); and/or suppressing postprandial glucagon secretion (amylin analogs).
