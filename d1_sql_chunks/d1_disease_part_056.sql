In clinical studies, Grade 3 and 4 increases in hepatic transaminases were observed in 6% of healthy volunteers and HIV subjects.  Liver function tests should be performed prior to initiating therapy and frequently throughout the duration of treatment.

Sympathetic stimulation may be important in maintaining the hemodynamic function in these patients, thus beta-blockade can worsen the heart failure.  However, therapy with beta-blockers may be beneficial and can be administered cautiously in some CHF patients provided they are well compensated and receiving digitalis, diuretics, an ACE inhibitor, and/or nitrates.  Carvedilol, specifically, is indicated for use with these agents in the treatment of mild to severe heart failure of ischemic or cardiomyopathic origin.  There is also increasing evidence that the addition of a beta-blocker to standard therapy can improve morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced heart failure, although it is uncertain whether effectiveness varies significantly with the different agents.

HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT).  Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT, and may include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal artery thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death.  Both HIT and HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy.

Eighth cranial nerve damage may manifest as vestibular and/or auditory toxicities, including dizziness, nystagmus, vertigo, ataxia, tinnitus, and varying degrees of hearing impairment.  Nephrotoxicity is usually evidenced by tubular necrosis; increases in BUN, nonprotein nitrogen, and serum creatinine concentration; decreases in urine specific gravity and creatinine clearance; proteinuria; and cells or casts in the urine.  Rarely, renal electrolyte wasting may occur, resulting in hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypokalemia that may be associated with paresthesia, tetany, confusion, and positive Chvostek and Trousseau signs.  Although aminoglycoside- induced nephrotoxicity is generally reversible following discontinuation of the drug, death from uremia has occurred rarely.  Therapy with aminoglycosides should be administered cautiously at reduced dosages in patients with renal impairment, since they may be at increased risk for oto- and nephrotoxicity due to drug accumulation.  To minimize the risk of toxicity, patients should be adequately hydrated, the usual aminoglycoside dosage should not be exceeded, use with other neuro- and nephrotoxic agents should be avoided, and peak and trough serum aminoglycoside concentrations should be periodically determined and dosage adjusted to maintain desired levels.

Eighth cranial nerve damage may manifest as vestibular and/or auditory toxicities, including dizziness, nystagmus, vertigo, ataxia, tinnitus, and varying degrees of hearing impairment.  Nephrotoxicity is usually evidenced by tubular necrosis; increases in BUN, nonprotein nitrogen, and serum creatinine concentration; decreases in urine specific gravity and creatinine clearance; proteinuria; and cells or casts in the urine.  Rarely, renal electrolyte wasting may occur, resulting in hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypokalemia that may be associated with paresthesia, tetany, confusion, and positive Chvostek and Trousseau signs.  Although aminoglycoside- induced nephrotoxicity is generally reversible following discontinuation of the drug, death from uremia has occurred rarely.  Therapy with aminoglycosides should be administered cautiously at reduced dosages in patients with renal impairment, since they may be at increased risk for oto- and nephrotoxicity due to drug accumulation.  To minimize the risk of toxicity, patients should be adequately hydrated, the usual aminoglycoside dosage should not be exceeded, use with other neuro- and nephrotoxic agents should be avoided, and peak and trough serum aminoglycoside concentrations should be periodically determined and dosage adjusted to maintain desired levels.

Eighth cranial nerve damage may manifest as vestibular and/or auditory toxicities, including dizziness, nystagmus, vertigo, ataxia, tinnitus, and varying degrees of hearing impairment.  Nephrotoxicity is usually evidenced by tubular necrosis; increases in BUN, nonprotein nitrogen, and serum creatinine concentration; decreases in urine specific gravity and creatinine clearance; proteinuria; and cells or casts in the urine.  Rarely, renal electrolyte wasting may occur, resulting in hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypokalemia that may be associated with paresthesia, tetany, confusion, and positive Chvostek and Trousseau signs.  Although aminoglycoside- induced nephrotoxicity is generally reversible following discontinuation of the drug, death from uremia has occurred rarely.  Therapy with aminoglycosides should be administered cautiously at reduced dosages in patients with renal impairment, since they may be at increased risk for oto- and nephrotoxicity due to drug accumulation.  To minimize the risk of toxicity, patients should be adequately hydrated, the usual aminoglycoside dosage should not be exceeded, use with other neuro- and nephrotoxic agents should be avoided, and peak and trough serum aminoglycoside concentrations should be periodically determined and dosage adjusted to maintain desired levels.

Eighth cranial nerve damage may manifest as vestibular and/or auditory toxicities, including dizziness, nystagmus, vertigo, ataxia, tinnitus, and varying degrees of hearing impairment.  Nephrotoxicity is usually evidenced by tubular necrosis; increases in BUN, nonprotein nitrogen, and serum creatinine concentration; decreases in urine specific gravity and creatinine clearance; proteinuria; and cells or casts in the urine.  Rarely, renal electrolyte wasting may occur, resulting in hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypokalemia that may be associated with paresthesia, tetany, confusion, and positive Chvostek and Trousseau signs.  Although aminoglycoside- induced nephrotoxicity is generally reversible following discontinuation of the drug, death from uremia has occurred rarely.  Therapy with aminoglycosides should be administered cautiously at reduced dosages in patients with renal impairment, since they may be at increased risk for oto- and nephrotoxicity due to drug accumulation.  To minimize the risk of toxicity, patients should be adequately hydrated, the usual aminoglycoside dosage should not be exceeded, use with other neuro- and nephrotoxic agents should be avoided, and peak and trough serum aminoglycoside concentrations should be periodically determined and dosage adjusted to maintain desired levels.

Rarely, renal electrolyte wasting may occur, resulting in hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypokalemia that may be associated with paresthesia, tetany, confusion, and positive Chvostek and Trousseau signs.  Although aminoglycoside- induced nephrotoxicity is generally reversible following discontinuation of the drug, death from uremia has occurred rarely.  Therapy with aminoglycosides should be administered cautiously at reduced dosages in patients with renal impairment, since they may be at increased risk for oto- and nephrotoxicity due to drug accumulation.  To minimize the risk of toxicity, patients should be adequately hydrated, the usual aminoglycoside dosage should not be exceeded, use with other neuro- and nephrotoxic agents should be avoided, and peak and trough serum aminoglycoside concentrations should be periodically determined and dosage adjusted to maintain desired levels.
