Vision testing at baseline (no later than 4 weeks after starting vigabatrin) and at least every 3 months during therapy is required for adults. Vision testing is also required about 3 to 6 months after the discontinuation of vigabatrin therapy. Due to the risk of irreversible vision loss, vigabatrin should be withdrawn from patients who fail to show substantial clinical benefit within 3 months of initiation, or sooner if treatment failure becomes obvious.
