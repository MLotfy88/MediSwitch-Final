Patients should be closely monitored for symptoms of the serotonin syndrome during treatment. Particular caution is advised when initiating or increasing the dosages of these agents. The potential risk for serotonin syndrome should be considered even when administering serotonergic agents sequentially, as some agents may demonstrate a prolonged elimination half-life.

At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of other serotonergic agents and initiation of treatment with sibutramine. If serotonin syndrome develops or is suspected during the course of therapy, all serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately and supportive care rendered as necessary.
