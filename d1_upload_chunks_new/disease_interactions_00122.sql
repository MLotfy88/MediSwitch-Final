The myopathy may be dose-related and is characterized by muscle aches and/or weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values exceeding 10 times the upper limit of normal.  Therapy with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors should be administered cautiously in patients with preexisting myopathy, in those with predisposing factors for myopathy or with a history of myoneural disorder, since it may delay the recognition or confound the diagnosis of a drug-induced musculoskeletal effect.  Patients should be advised to report promptly any unusual muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.  Periodic CPK determinations may be considered in some patients, although the value of such monitoring is uncertain.  HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor therapy should be withdrawn if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or if drug-related myopathy is diagnosed or suspected.', '3', '', 'DDInter', 0);
