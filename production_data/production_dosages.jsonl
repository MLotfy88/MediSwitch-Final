The average is 200 to 300 mg/day for patients with mild gout and 400 to 600 mg/day for those with moderately severe tophaceous gout. The appropriate dosage may be administered in divided doses or as a single equivalent dose with the 300-mg tablet. Dosage requirements in excess of 300 mg should be administered in divided doses. The minimal effective dosage is 100 to 200 mg daily and the maximal recommended dosage is 800 mg daily. To reduce the possibility of flare-up of acute gouty attacks, it is recommended that the patient start with a low dose of ZYLOPRIM (100 mg daily) and increase at weekly intervals by 100 mg until a serum uric acid level of 6 mg/dL or less is attained but without exceeding the maximal recommended dosage. Normal serum urate levels are usually achieved in 1 to 3 weeks. The upper limit of normal is about 7 mg/dL for men and postmenopausal women and 6 mg/dL for premenopausal women. Too much reliance should not be placed on a single serum uric acid determination since, for technical reasons, estimation of uric acid may be difficult. By selecting the appropriate dosage and, in certain patients, using uricosuric agents concurrently, it is possible to reduce serum uric acid to normal or, if desired, to as low as 2 to 3 mg/dL and keep it there indefinitely. While adjusting the dosage of ZYLOPRIM in patients who are being treated with colchicine and/or anti-inflammatory agents, it is wise to continue the latter therapy until serum uric acid has been normalized and there has been freedom from acute gouty attacks for several months.

Increases in dose should not exceed 100 mg/day in a 3-day period. Gradual escalation in dosage is also important if agitation, motor restlessness, and insomnia, often seen during the initial days of treatment, are to be minimized. If necessary, these effects may be managed by temporary reduction of dose or the short-term administration of an intermediate to long-acting sedative hypnotic. A sedative hypnotic usually is not required beyond the first week of treatment. Insomnia may also be minimized by avoiding bedtime doses. If distressing, untoward effects supervene, dose escalation should be stopped. No single-dose of bupropion hydrochloride tablets should exceed 150 mg. Bupropion should be administered 3 times daily, preferably with at least 6 hours between successive doses. Usual Dosage for Adults The usual adult dose is 300 mg/day, given 3 times daily. Dosing should begin at 200 mg/day, given as 100 mg twice daily. Based on clinical response, this dose may be increased to 300 mg/day, given as 100 mg 3 times daily, no sooner than 3 days after beginning therapy (see Table 3). Table 3.

An increase in dosage, up to a maximum of 450 mg/day, given in divided doses of not more than 150 mg each, may be considered for patients in whom no clinical improvement is noted after several weeks of treatment at 300 mg/day. Dosing above 300 mg/day may be accomplished using the 75 mg or 100 mg tablets.

Because bupropion is extensively metabolized, the coadministration of other drugs may affect its clinical activity. In vitro studies indicate that bupropion is primarily metabolized to hydroxybupropion by the CYP2B6 isoenzyme. Therefore, the potential exists for a drug interaction between bupropion and drugs that are the substrates or inhibitors of the CYP2B6 isoenzyme (e.g., orphenadrine, thiotepa and cyclophosphamide). In addition, in vitro studies suggest that paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine, and fluvoxamine as well as nelfinavir, ritonavir, and efavirenz inhibit the hydroxylation of bupropion.

To minimize dose-independent side effects, it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy.

Itraconazole capsules must be swallowed whole. Itraconazole capsules are a different preparation than itraconazole oral solution and should not be used interchangeably. Treatment of Blastomycosis and Histoplasmosis: The recommended dose is 200 mg once daily (2 capsules). If there is no obvious improvement, or there is evidence of progressive fungal disease, the dose should be increased in 100-mg increments to a maximum of 400 mg daily. Doses above 200 mg/day should be given in two divided doses. Treatment of Aspergillosis: A daily dose of 200 to 400 mg is recommended. Treatment in Life-Threatening Situations: In life-threatening situations, a loading dose should be used. Although clinical studies did not provide for a loading dose, it is recommended, based on pharmacokinetic data, that a loading dose of 200 mg (2 capsules) three times daily (600 mg/day) be given for the first 3 days of treatment. Treatment should be continued for a minimum of three months and until clinical parameters and laboratory tests indicate that the active fungal infection has subsided. An inadequate period of treatment may lead to recurrence of active infection. Itraconazole capsules and itraconazole oral solution should not be used interchangeably. Only the oral solution has been demonstrated effective for oral and/or esophageal candidiasis. Treatment of Onychomycosis: Toenails with or without fingernail involvement: The recommended dose is 200 mg (2 capsules) once daily for 12 consecutive weeks. Treatment of Onychomycosis: Fingernails only: The recommended dosing regimen is 2 treatment courses, each consisting of 200 mg (2 capsules) b.i.d. (400 mg/day) for 1 week.

The safety and effectiveness of Enbrel in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age with pJIA have not been established. Juvenile Psoriatic Arthritis The safety and effectiveness of Enbrel have been established in pediatric patients 2 years to 17 years old with JPsA. Use of Enbrel in JPsA is supported by evidence from adequate and well controlled studies of Enbrel in adults with PsA; pharmacokinetic data from adult patients with PsA, RA, and PsO; and pharmacokinetic data from pediatric patients with active JIA and PsO. Safety of Enbrel in JPsA is supported by a clinical study in 69 pediatric patients with moderately to severely active JIA aged 2 to 17 years; a clinical study in 211 pediatric patients with moderate to severe PsO aged 4 to 17 years; and an open-label extension study in 182 pediatric patients with moderate to severe PsO aged 4 to 17 years. The observed pre-dose (trough) concentrations are generally comparable between adults with RA and PsA and pediatric patients with active JIA, as well as adults with PsO and pediatric patients with PsO.
