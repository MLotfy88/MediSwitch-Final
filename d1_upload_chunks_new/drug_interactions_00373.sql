This will decrease the overlap of systemic exposure to both compounds and reduce the likelihood of additive hematologic toxicities. However, the washout procedure may also induce disease worsening if the patient had been responding to leflunomide treatment. Patients who do not receive the washout procedure prior to switching should be monitored closely for hematologic toxicity. All patients treated with leflunomide or teriflunomide should be advised to contact their physician if they develop signs and symptoms of infection such as fever, chills, diarrhea, sore throat, muscle aches, shortness of breath, blood in phlegm, weight loss, red or inflamed skin, body sores, and pain or burning during urination.
