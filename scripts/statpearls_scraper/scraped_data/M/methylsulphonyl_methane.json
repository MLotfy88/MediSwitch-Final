    "clinical_significance": "The instruments commonly used in nuclear medicine are listed below.\n\nGeiger-Müller Counters\n\nClinical use:\nGM counters find clinical application in monitoring low radiation levels, providing readings in counts per minute converted into milliRoentgen per hour (mR/h).\n[19]\n\nConstruction and operation:\nGM counters are typically constructed with an ionization chamber that operates at high voltage settings, ranging from 500 to 900 V. This chamber is made of metal, often aluminum or steel, and contains gases such as argon, alongside either halogen or methane. The detection window typically comprises mica and features an external mesh, occasionally accompanied by an aluminum cap. When radiation strikes this cap, it can lead to ionization, releasing electrons that subsequently ionize the gas molecules within the chamber. Increasing the pressure inside the chamber enhances the likelihood of ionization occurring.\n\nFunctionality limitations:\nGM counters have certain limitations, including the inability to differentiate between different types of radiation, as each type causes maximum ionization. Another limitation is the presence of a \"dead time,\" typically ranging from 200 to 500 microseconds, during which the counter cannot process new incoming radiation due to continuous ionization pulses.\n\nQuenching gases, such as organic solvent vapors or halogens, are employed to address these issues. These gases absorb electrons generated by ionizations, effectively ending the detector's \"paralyzed\" state. It's worth noting that organic solvents have a limited use-life, whereas halogen gases can be utilized indefinitely to mitigate these limitations.\n\nUsage and calibration:\nGM counters are widely used for their portability, battery-operated design, durability, and cost-effectiveness. Some models come equipped with alarms that activate when they detect specific radiation levels, often called \"area monitors,\" commonly used in nuclear medicine laboratories. To ensure their accuracy and optimal performance, these counters are typically calibrated using cesium-137, which emits high-energy photons at 662 keV. It is recommended to perform annual calibrations to maintain the reliability of GM counters.\n[20]\n\nDetection efficiency:\nGM counters exhibit distinct characteristics in terms of detection efficiency. They effectively detect beta particles, achieving a 100% efficiency rate. However, their efficiency is notably lower when detecting gamma rays and x-rays, typically within the 1% to 2% range. Despite this lower efficiency, GM counters exhibit remarkable sensitivity, surpassing that of low-voltage ionization chambers by a factor of 10. This heightened sensitivity allows them to detect radiation levels up to approximately 100 mR/h.\n\nDose Calibrators\n\nClinical use:\nDose calibrators serve a crucial clinical purpose, primarily used to measure radioactivity levels before administering radiopharmaceuticals to patients.\n\nFunction and construction:\nThe dose calibrator functions as a specific type of ionization chamber, typically operating at low voltage settings of approximately 150 V. This calibrator specializes in measuring the current generated by radioactivity, notable for its absence of a dead time, thereby enabling continuous operation.\n\nWithin the dose calibrator, a sealed chamber contains argon and halogen gases maintained at high pressure ranging from 5 to 12 atm. Radiopharmaceuticals placed in a well surrounded by the ionization chamber generate varying currents dependent on the type and energy of radiation they emit.\n[21]\nMoreover, the dose calibrator features practical elements such as push buttons, settings to accommodate various radiopharmaceuticals, and an array of activity display units to facilitate accurate measurements.\n\nCalibration and testing:\nCalibration and testing are essential to the dose calibrator's operation, ensuring accurate patient dosing.\n[22]\nThe calibration process involves several critical steps for maintaining the precision and reliability of the dose calibrator's operation, including initial calibration performed at the time of installation. Furthermore, ongoing QC measures are implemented through constancy checks, which are carried out daily, accuracy checks performed annually, and linearity checks scheduled quarterly. In addition, geometric assessments are performed post-repairs or maintenance to confirm the device's continued accuracy and dependability. Long half-life radiotracers, such as cesium-137, are frequently utilized for constancy and accuracy checks. Notably, recalibration becomes necessary if a ±10% difference is detected between the measured and actual activity, ensuring the calibration remains precise and reliable.\n\nThe assessment of linearity in the dose calibrator involves the following 2 distinct methods:\n\nDecay method: This method involves measuring the maximum injected dose over a specified period, enabling the evaluation of linearity with activity decay.\n\nShielding method: In this approach, lead sleeves or masks of increasing thickness are used to simulate the effects of decay, allowing for the examination of linearity under various shielding conditions.\n\nIn the context of dose calibrators, a deviation exceeding ±10% between measured and expected values indicates the need for instrument repairs.\n[23]\nFurthermore, it is essential to evaluate how sample volume and container shape impact measurements through geometric assessments. This analysis results in uniform measurement corrections to ensure the dose calibrator's accuracy and consistency.\n\nGamma Well Counters\n\nClinical use:\nGamma well counters are primarily used in radioimmunoassays and for measuring radioactivity levels in various samples.\n[24]\n\nConstruction and components:\nGamma well counters consist of a NaI(Tl) crystal with a central hole or well designed for the placement of radioactivity samples. The crystal's dimensions typically range from 5 to 23 cm in diameter and thickness. To ensure safety and accuracy, the counter is shielded with a lead ring attached to a PMT at the base. Additional electronic instruments integrated into the well counter include a preamplifier, amplifier, pulse height analyzer, and a counter, enhancing its functionality and measurement capabilities.\n\nBenefits and challenges:\nGamma well counters offer several advantages and face specific challenges in its operations. One of its notable benefits is the design of the well, which ensures that most of the radiation emitted by the sample is detected, resulting in a high geometric efficiency of approximately 99%. However, it is important to note that in cases where larger sample volumes are used, there is a potential for decreased efficiency due to radiation escaping from the well. To address this, correction factors are necessary for different sample volumes to maintain accurate measurements.\n\nCalibration and efficiency:\nDuring the initial calibration following installation, long-lived radiotracers, such as cesium-137, are used to establish the baseline calibration. The calibration procedure includes adjusting voltage settings to identify the point at which maximum count levels are achieved, commonly referred to as high voltage calibration. Furthermore, regular calibration checks are imperative to maintain the accuracy of the counters and ensure precise measurements over time.\n\nGamma well counters exhibit specific detection efficiencies for various radiotracers:\n\nTechnetium-99m: For technetium-99m, the detection efficiency is at its maximum, reaching 100%.\n\nHigh-energy radiotracers: In the case of high-energy radiotracers, such as iodine-131, the detection efficiency typically ranges from 30% to 90%, which depends on the thickness of the crystal used for measurements.\n\nProbe Counting Systems\n\nThyroid probe:\nThe thyroid probe is specifically designed to precisely count radiation emitted by the thyroid gland, serving a distinct clinical purpose. The probe's construction and components include a 5-cm-thick NaI(Tl) crystal. The probe is equipped with a PMT, preamplifier, amplifier, pulse height analyzer, and scaler, similar to the components found in the well counter. The probe is typically mounted on a stand, allowing precise positioning over the patient's neck. To isolate and focus on counts originating from the thyroid gland specifically, the thyroid probe features a 25-cm-long cylindrical lead collimator. This specialized probe is often used in measuring the total thyroid uptake following the oral administration of radiotracers, including iodine-123 or iodine-131.\n[25]\n\nMiniature gamma-ray probes:\nThese probes are specialized tools primarily used in oncological applications, particularly for sentinel lymph node scintigraphy and radio-guided surgery. Given their role in surgical procedures, these probes must be highly efficient in detecting gamma radiation and easily maneuverable during surgery.\n[26]\nThe probe comprises a 10-mm-thick CsI(Tl) scintillation crystal paired with a silicone photodiode. This choice of a silicon photodiode is made to replace the traditional PMT due to its lightweight properties and compatibility with the CsI(Tl) scintillation crystal, making the probe more convenient for surgical use.\n\nGamma Cameras\n\nFunction and construction:\nThe gamma camera is a critical tool in nuclear medicine, and its functionality relies on a combination of detector components, electronic instrumentation, and a computer system to deliver essential diagnostic imaging. Key performance characteristics, such as spatial and energy resolution, detection efficiency, image uniformity, and contrast, are crucial in determining the system's effectiveness in diagnosing various medical conditions.\n\nAdvancements in technology persistently refine and improve the capabilities of gamma cameras, further expanding their utility in healthcare. The initial prototype of the gamma camera by Hal O. Anger in 1958 paved the way for ongoing modifications, culminating in the development of the modern gamma camera.\n[27]\n\nThe contemporary gamma camera comprises 3 fundamental components—detector elements, electronic instrumentation, and a computer system.\n\nDetector components: The gamma camera comprises several critical detector components, as mentioned below.\nCollimators: Collimators are made primarily from materials such as lead or tungsten for absorptive collimation to isolate the desired radiation for imaging. Four common types of collimators are used in gamma cameras—parallel hole, converging, diverging, and pin-hole. Parallel hole collimators are the most frequently utilized type for gamma cameras.\n[28]\n[29]\nConverging collimators can zoom in and non-invert images when the radiation source is placed in focus.\n[30]\n[31]\nDiverging collimators provide minified, non-inverted images for specific applications. Pin-hole collimators create inverted but prominent images with a single hole.\n[32]\nScintillation crystal: The gamma camera features a scintillation crystal, typically a 6- to 12.5-mm-thick rectangular NaI(Tl) crystal, and is enclosed in aluminum to safeguard it against moisture.\n[16]\n[33]\nPhotomultiplier tube: The gamma camera is equipped with 30 to 100 PMTs situated at the rear end of the crystal, and an optical guide aids them. PMTs convert the light signals generated within the crystal into electrons. They further amplify these signals through dynodes, producing electric pulses proportionate to the radiation interactions.\n[34]\nIn addition, PMTs assist in pinpointing the origin of the light signals within the crystal.\n[35]\nElectronic instrumentation: The electronic instrumentation within the gamma camera performs several crucial functions. The camera involves signal processing to convert raw detector data into interpretable images. This electronic system consists of essential components, including a preamplifier, pulse height analyzer, and an amplifier to accept valid signals from the detector. Pulse height analyzers come in 2 categories—single-channel, suitable for monoenergetic radiation, and multichannel, optimized for handling multiple energy gamma.\n[36]\nThe system is programmed to discern and discard unwanted or scattered radiation events, only recording the accepted signals for image generation.\nComputer system: The computer system integrated into the gamma camera specializes in nuclear medicine imaging and is adept at managing imaging protocols, data storage, image processing, and display.\n[37]\nThe system operates with customized imaging protocols in adherence to established guidelines. Images can be acquired in grayscale or color scales, and software options enable image smoothing and background subtraction. Furthermore, the system supports region of interest (ROI) selection, which can be done automatically or manually, and facilitates the generation of time-activity curves.\n[38]\nVarious image types, including planar, static, dynamic, and gated, can be produced by this versatile computer system.\n\nPerformance characteristics:\nThe performance characteristics of the gamma camera include spatial and energy resolution, detection efficiency, and image uniformity and contrast.\n\nSpatial resolution: Spatial resolution is an essential characteristic that indicates the gamma camera's capacity to distinguish closely spaced points. This comprises 2 primary components—collimator resolution and intrinsic resolution.\n[39]\nSpatial resolution can be evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively with the help of bar phantoms and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) measurement.\nEnergy resolution: Energy resolution is a significant feature that characterizes the gamma camera's ability to differentiate between radiation energies. This aspect is notably affected by statistical fluctuations in photon production. The gamma camera generally provides better resolution for higher energy gamma rays.\n[40]\nDetection efficiency: Detection efficiency measures how effectively the system converts incident gamma rays into valid signals. However, it can be influenced by factors such as detector size, crystal thickness, source distance, and gamma-ray energy. The type of collimators used can also impact detection efficiency, with high-sensitivity collimators improving the detection process.\nImage uniformity: Image uniformity refers to the consistency in gamma camera responses. However, non-uniformities can occur due to photon production, transmission, and PMT output variations. To assess image uniformity, intrinsic and extrinsic uniformity tests are conducted. These tests help ensure that the camera provides consistent and reliable imaging results.\n[41]\nImage contrast: Image contrast in gamma camera imaging depends on variations in radiopharmaceutical uptake in different body regions. Techniques such as background subtraction and contrast enhancement software can enhance the contrast in the resulting images, making them more diagnostically useful.\n\nSingle-Photon Emission Computed Tomography\n\nSPECT involves the 3-dimensional (3D) acquisition of radiation sources that emit either monoenergetic (radiations with single energy) or polyenergetic (radiations with multiple energies) photons, such as technetium 99m and iodine 131, from all around the radioactive source (see\nImage.\nTechnetium 99m MDP Scan).\n\nSPECT cameras:\nSPECT cameras share a design resemblance with planar gamma cameras but come with additional features. They usually incorporate multiple camera heads, often in pairs, to improve efficiency. These camera heads rotate around the patient, capturing images from multiple angles. The camera heads may follow circular or elliptical orbits depending on the specific study. In advanced systems, the cameras can estimate body contours, enhancing imaging accuracy.\n[42]\n\nAcquisition:\nThe SPECT system captures a series of \"projection views\" as it rotates 360° around the patient.\n[43]\nTypically, 64 or 128 views are captured via the SPECT system, which is utilized to generate cross-sectional images. Sufficient counts are essential for achieving good resolution in the images. Managing patient motion during the scan is a critical challenge; the activity is monitored through cine loops or sinograms.\n[44]\nTwo acquisition methods are commonly used—step-and-shoot and continuous scanning.\n[45]\nThe images acquired during the scan are subsequently reconstructed using a specific software.\n\nPerformance characteristics:\nThe performance characteristics of a SPECT include spatial resolution, sensitivity, image uniformity and contrast, and attenuation.\n\nSpatial resolution: Spatial resolution is a critical performance characteristic of a SPECT system, and it quantifies the system's capacity to generate detailed images. This resolution is assessed in 2 distinct planes—axial and transaxial—allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of imaging quality.\n\nSensitivity: Sensitivity is an essential performance metric in SPECT imaging, and it relies on several factors, including collimator efficiency, crystal thickness, and the energy of the gamma rays detected.\n\nImage uniformity: Image uniformity measures the camera's ability to provide consistent responses throughout the imaging process. Maintaining uniformity is vital for accurate diagnosis, with stringent standards allowing only a 1% level of non-uniformity, ensuring high-quality images.\n\nImage contrast: In SPECT imaging, the ability to enhance image contrast is a valuable feature, primarily attributed to using cross-sectional imaging techniques.\n\nAttenuation: Gamma rays attenuate differently depending on their depth of origin within the patient's body. To address this, corrections are often necessary to compensate for variations in gamma-ray attenuation. The advent of hybrid imaging, such as SPECT/CT, has greatly improved attenuation correction, resulting in enhanced image quality and diagnostic accuracy.\n\nImage reconstruction:\nIn SPECT imaging, one of the standard techniques for image reconstruction is filtered back projection (FBP).\n[46]\n[47]\nFurthermore, iterative reconstruction methods are utilized to further enhance image quality by considering physical parameters.\n[48]\n\nSpecialized SPECT systems:\nIn the realm of specialized SPECT systems, there are dedicated configurations designed for distinct clinical purposes—cardiac and brain SPECT techniques.\n\nCardiac SPECT: Cardiac SPECT systems focus on cardiac imaging by utilizing specialized detector heads to enhance the accuracy of heart-related scans.\n[49]\n\nBrain SPECT: Brain SPECT systems are tailored to deliver higher sensitivity and resolution in neuroimaging, allowing for detailed exploration of brain functions and structures.\n[50]\nThese specialized systems offer improved spatial resolution and contribute to studying various biological phenomena related to brain and cardiac health.\n\nPositron Emission Tomography\n\nFunction and construction:\nPET imaging detects the annihilation of positrons and electrons, giving rise to 2 photons of 511 keV that travel in opposite directions. In clinical practice, positron-emitting radiopharmaceuticals, such as rubidium-82 and F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose, are administered to the patient. These radiopharmaceuticals emit positrons, which undergo annihilation with nearby electrons upon traveling a short distance (mere nanometers), producing the distinctive pair of 511 keV photons.\n\nPET imaging utilizes photons generated during the annihilation events of radionuclides, including F-18, C-11, and O-15. PET uses coincidence imaging from the 2 photons of 511 keV to precisely triangulate and map radiotracer activity within the body. Radionuclides release positrons, which, upon annihilation with electrons, give rise to photons projecting in opposite directions. In PET imaging, the emitted photons interact with scintillation crystals, typically made of materials such as BGO, gadolinium silicate, or lutetium oxyorthosilicate. Here, whether both photons contribute to a \"true\" count or are too temporally distant to be recorded is determined. The photons possess sufficient kinetic energy to travel a short distance before annihilation, referred to as the mean positron range. The range of this mean positron distance varies depending on the density of the structure it interacts with. This contributes to the inherent limitation in spatial resolution, typically around 5 mm on current PET scanners.\n\nPET cameras differ from gamma and SPECT cameras in several ways. First, they feature multiple detector rings comprising smaller units or blocks of scintillator detectors instead of the traditional camera heads. These detector rings are interspersed with movable lead septa and can be adjusted based on the study type being conducted. The detector elements comprise a block of large scintillation crystals, subdivided into smaller sub-segments or clusters of smaller crystals. Due to the high energy of 511 keV photons, these scintillation crystals need higher density than NaI(Tl) crystals. These denser crystals, such as BSO, GSO, and LSO, can detect photons more rapidly, enhancing their ability to capture coincidence events.\n\nPET cameras are organized differently compared to typical SPECT cameras. They feature only a few PMTs that are distributed across multiple subdivisions of the detector elements.\n[31]\nThese PMTs positioned behind the incident crystal receive the highest intensity of photon light, and their signals are subsequently analyzed in the pulse height analyzer to determine whether to accept or reject the signal.\n\nPositron annihilation events are frequently positioned asymmetrically relative to the detector ring, resulting in a situation where 2 detectors may not simultaneously detect 2 coincident photons. Photons detected within a specific time window, typically around 5 to 15 nanoseconds, are considered \"in coincidence.\"\n[32]\nNearly 99% of the detected photons may fail to meet this criterion and are categorized as \"isolated events,\" as they occur outside the required time frame and are consequently rejected. This process, known as \"electronic collimation, \" contributes to dead time.\n\nAcquisition:\nAlthough there are efforts to isolate \"true\" events, image degradation can still occur due to noise from scattered photons and the simultaneous occurrence of multiple unrelated events. These random coincidence events decrease the image's resolution and can limit diagnostic image quality.\n[33]\n\nPET cameras can acquire both 2D and 3D images. Typically, data obtained with the septa between the detector rings results in 2D images. However, the data can be processed to generate 3D views when the septa are removed. Septa can block the oblique photons antiparallel to the plane of the detector rings. Although this helps decrease scattered radiation, it also reduces the number of recorded events by the system, leading to lower sensitivity. This compromise is made to achieve improved image resolution.\n[34]\nWhen the septa are removed, the system records most of the photons, even those originating outside the plane of the detector ring, enabling data processing in a 3D format. However, this comes at the cost of reduced image resolution, as it also accepts many scattered photons.\n\nAnother crucial concept is \"time of flight,\" which aims to compensate for differences in the distances traveled by photon pairs from the point of annihilation to the detectors. When one photon is relatively close to a detector, the other has a much longer distance to travel, and the precision of the point of annihilation is reduced. Fortunately, the resulting time difference between the incident photons can be manipulated. This time difference can be used to estimate the location of the positron annihilation event.\n\nPET cameras:\nPET cameras are distinct from gamma and SPECT cameras, featuring multiple detector rings separated by lead septa. Within these rings, detector elements are presented, which are block detectors organized in circular or hexagonal configurations. Denser crystals such as BGO, LSO, and GSO are utilized to enhance detection efficiency and speed.\n[16]\nThe arrangement of PMTs is different and coupled to block detectors.\n[51]\nPET cameras use annihilation coincidence detection to determine the origins of photons.\n[52]\nAcquisition:\nPET acquisition focuses on capturing actual coincidence events resulting from positron annihilation, providing precise imaging.\n[53]\nThe presence of scattered and random coincidence events can introduce noise, impacting image quality. PET can acquire 2D and 3D images, depending on whether the lead septa are present or removed. The time of flight measurement contributes to improved resolution, and the reconstruction process is similar to that used in SPECT imaging.\n[54]\nPerformance characteristics:\nThe performance characteristics of a PET include spatial resolution, sensitivity, and attenuation.\nSpatial resolution: Spatial resolution in PET depends on detector size and is influenced by various factors that affect the accuracy of detecting annihilation events.\nSensitivity: PET generally exhibits higher sensitivity compared to SPECT due to the absence of a collimator. However, sensitivity can vary based on camera design and the choice of scintillation crystals.\nAttenuation: Attenuation correction is crucial in PET imaging. This correction can be achieved through methods such as blank and transmission scans. The hybrid PET/CT approach provides improved attenuation correction details, although it may sometimes introduce artifacts.\n\nMultimodality/Hybrid Imaging/Imaging Reconstruction\n\nThe data acquired from all the previously mentioned cameras undergoes processing to generate visual representations or images. In the case of conventional gamma cameras, these images are typically 2D and consist of a matrix divided into smaller pixels. The data or signals are stored in specific locations corresponding to the source of the signal. These signals are presented on the screen matrix, aligning with the respective signal locations. The matrix is divided into pixels, each assigned a distinct address or location.\n[35]\n. Each signal is associated with a specific address within the image matrix. A finer pixel size leads to improved signal localization and image resolution.\n\nIn SPECT and PET imaging, image reconstruction techniques are critical for producing high-quality 3D cross-sectional images based on the collected projection data. FBP, a commonly used technique, is an analytical reconstruction method in nuclear medicine imaging. Image reconstruction entails filtering the acquired projection data in the frequency domain and subsequently back-projecting the filtered data.\n[36]\nAlthough FBP is computationally efficient, it must consider physical phenomena such as attenuation and scatter. These components contribute to poor image quality.\n[37]\nHowever, iterative methods update the reconstructed image by continuously minimizing the difference between the acquired projection data and the forward projection of the current image estimate. These methods can integrate physical parameters, such as attenuation and scatter modeling, resulting in superior image quality compared to FBP.\n[37]\n[38]\n[39]\n\nMultimodality imaging combines the functional and anatomical information provided by SPECT or PET with the high-resolution anatomical imaging capabilities of CT and MRI. SPECT/CT combines SPECT imaging with CT, providing functional and anatomical information in a single examination.\n[40]\nThe benefits include accurate anatomical localization, improved attenuation correction, and better characterization of lesions by correlating functional and morphological information. However, SPECT/MRI holds an edge regarding superior soft tissue contrast, acquisition of functional images, and reduced radiation exposure compared to CT.\n[43]\n[41]\n[42]\n\nSimilarly, PET is combined with CT for better localization and attenuation correction of the acquired data. PET/CT is widely used in oncology for tumor detection, staging, and treatment response assessment because it combines metabolic information from PET with anatomical details from CT.\n[44]\nHowever, current research is dedicated to refining PET/MRI image reconstruction algorithms, enhancing motion correction methods, and creating innovative PET-compatible MRI hardware to expand clinical applications and improve image quality.\n[44]\n[45]\nThese hybrid imaging techniques represent a substantial advancement in diagnostic capabilities, promising continued enhancements in image quality, reduced radiation exposure, and expanded clinical uses.\n\nIn summary, multimodality imaging combines the functional and anatomical information provided by SPECT or PET with the high-resolution anatomical imaging capabilities of CT and MRI.\n\nSPECT/CT:\nSPECT/CT is a hybrid imaging technique that combines SPECT and CT imaging, providing functional and anatomical details.\n[55]\nThis integration offers several benefits, including accurate anatomical localization, improved attenuation correction, and enhanced lesion characterization by correlating functional and anatomical data. The CT scanner of SPECT/CT has an x-ray tube and a detector element arranged in a complete or partial ring. Low-dose CT scans are utilized for attenuation correction, whereas diagnostic CT scans help assess anatomical localization and lesion morphology. SPECT/MRI offers several advantages, including superior soft tissue contrast, functional imaging capabilities, and reduced radiation exposure compared to CT. This makes SPECT/MRI particularly valuable in clinical applications.\n[56]\n\nPET/CT:\nPET/CT is a hybrid imaging modality that combines both PET and CT imaging techniques. This integration allows for enhanced localization and attenuation correction of acquired data, making it particularly valuable in the field of oncology for tumor detection, staging, and assessing treatment responses.\n[57]\nThe technique also combines the metabolic data obtained from PET with the anatomical details provided by CT.\n\nPET/MRI research:\nResearch in the field of PET/MRI is primarily concentrated on enhancing image reconstruction algorithms and refining motion correction techniques. Furthermore, there is a focus on developing novel MRI hardware compatible with PET technology.\n[58]\nThese efforts are directed toward improving clinical applications and overall image quality.\n\nIn conclusion, hybrid imaging techniques such as SPECT/CT, SPECT/MRI, and PET/CT represent significant advancements in diagnostic capabilities. They hold the potential to improve image quality, reduce radiation exposure, and expand the range of clinical applications available in the field of nuclear medicine.\n\nNuclear Medicine Imaging Instruments Quality Control\n\nQC plays a crucial role in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of various instruments, including gamma cameras, SPECT/CT, and PET/CT systems.\n[59]\n[60]\nQC protocols encompass regular tests and procedures to assess system performance, detect potential issues, and maintain optimal imaging quality. Although QC procedures may vary depending on production specifications, the below-mentioned techniques provide a concise summary of QC checks with which radiologists and nuclear medicine physicians should be acquainted.\n\nGamma cameras:\nIn the realm of gamma cameras, QC procedures encompass a range of daily, weekly, and annual checks designed to uphold consistent and reliable imaging performance.\n\nDaily: In the daily QC routine, photopeak and uniformity tests are performed to ensure consistent image quality across the field of view.\n[61]\n\nWeekly: In the weekly QC procedures, spatial resolution and linearity tests are conducted to determine the system's resolution and identify distortions using bar phantoms.\n\nAnnually: In the annual QC procedures, energy resolution tests are performed to differentiate between gamma photons of varied energy levels. In addition, camera sensitivity tests are conducted to measure the detection of low-level gamma emissions.\n\nSPECT/CT:\nIn the realm of SPECT/CT, QC procedures encompass a range of daily and weekly checks designed to uphold consistent and reliable imaging performance.\n\nDaily: In the daily QC routine, photopeak and uniformity tests are conducted similarly to gamma cameras.\n\nWeekly: Every week, operators assess the system's spatial resolution using phantoms and ensure the alignment of detectors with the axis of rotation through center of rotation (COR) assessments.\n\nPET cameras:\nIn the realm of PET cameras, QC procedures include daily and weekly checks to ensure consistent and reliable imaging performance.\n\nDaily: For PET cameras, daily QC measures involve the acquisition of a sinogram using a uniform radionuclide-filled cylindrical phantom to assess image uniformity.\n\nWeekly: Every week, normalization procedures are carried out by irradiating detector rings with germanium 68 to standardize counts, as per established protocols.\n[62]\n\nCT scanner quality assurance:\nCT scanners are sophisticated medical devices used in diagnostic imaging; therefore, various quality assurance procedures are conducted regularly to uphold their accuracy and reliability.\n\nDaily: The daily assessments involve scrutinizing voltage or current settings, image noise, and CT number accuracy using phantoms.\n\nMonthly: Monthly evaluations examine spatial resolution, linearity, and mechanical factors."
