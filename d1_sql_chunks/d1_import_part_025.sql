As well, olanzapine is indicated, in combination with fluoxetine for the treatment of episodes of depression associated with bipolar disorder type 1 and treatment-resistant depression in patients over 10 years old.[A177014]



Olanzapine is also approved for the management of psychomotor agitation associated with schizophrenia and bipolar I mania.[FDA label]



Schizophrenia is a complex biochemical brain disorder that affects the person''s ability to differentiate reality. It is usually observed as the presence of delusions, hallucinations, social withdrawal and disturbed thinking.[L5936]



Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition defined by periods of extreme mood disturbances. It is categorized in different types from which type 1 is known to involve episodes of severe mania and often depression while type 2 presents less severe forms of mania.[L5939]



Olanzapine is also indicated in combination with [samidorphan] for the treatment of bipolar I disorder, either as an adjunct to lithium or valproate or as monotherapy for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes or as maintenance therapy, and for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults.[L34359]', 'The activity of olanzapine is achieved by the antagonism of multiple neuronal receptors including the dopamine receptor D1, D2, D3 and D4 in the brain, the serotonin receptors 5HT2A, 5HT2C, 5HT3 and 5HT6, the alpha-1 adrenergic receptor, the histamine receptor H1 and multiple muscarinic receptors.[A176993, A176999]



As abovementioned, olanzapine presents a wide profile of targets, however, its antagonistic effect towards the dopamine D2 receptor in the mesolimbic pathway is key as it blocks dopamine from having a potential action at the post-synaptic receptor. The binding of olanzapine to the dopamine D2 receptors is easily dissociable and hence, it allows for a certain degree of dopamine neurotransmission.[A177014]



On the other hand, olanzapine acts in the serotonin 5HT2A receptors in the frontal cortex in a similar manner than the reported on dopamine D2 receptors. This determined effect allows for a decrease in adverse effects.[A177014]', 'The effect of olanzapine in the D2 receptor is reported to produce the positive effects of this drug such as a decrease in hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, disorganized thought, and disorganized behavior. On the other hand, its effect on the serotonin 5HT2A receptor prevents the onset of anhedonia, flat affect, alogia, avolition and poor attention.[A177014] Based on the specific mechanism of action, olanzapine presents a higher affinity for the dopamine D2 receptor when compared to the rest of the dopamine receptor isotypes. This characteristic significantly reduces the presence of side effects.[T554]



Clinical trials for the original use of olanzapine demonstrated significant effectiveness in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in adults and acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder in adolescents.[A177008]



The effect of olanzapine on dopamine and serotonin receptors has been suggested to reduce chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting as those receptors are suggested to be involved in this process. For this effect, several clinical trials have been conducted and it has been shown that olanzapine can produce a significant increase in total control of nausea and vomiting.[A176993] In a high-level study of the effect of olanzapine for this condition, a complete response on the delay phase was observed in 84% of the individual and control of emesis of over 80% despite the phase.[A176999]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

The hetero-octomeric complex of the channel is composed of four pore-forming Kir6.2 subunits and four regulatory sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) subunits. Alternative splicing allows the formation of channels composed of varying subunit isoforms expressed at different concentrations in different tissues.[A177730] In pancreatic beta cells, ATP-sensitive potassium channels play a role as essential metabolic sensors and regulators that couple membrane excitability with glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS).[A177727] When there is a decrease in the ATP:ADP ratio, the channels are activated and open, leading to K+ efflux from the cell, membrane hyperpolarization, and suppression of insulin secretion.[A177727] In contrast, increased uptake of glucose into the cell leads to elevated intracellular ATP:ADP ratio, leading to the closure of channels and membrane depolarization. Depolarization leads to activation and opening of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and consequently an influx of calcium ions into the cell.[A177727] Elevated intracellular calcium levels causes the contraction of the filaments of actomyosin responsible for the exocytosis of insulin granules stored in vesicles.[A177715] Glimepiride blocks the ATP-sensitive potassium channel by binding non-specifically to the B sites of both sulfonylurea receptor-1 (SUR1) and sulfonylurea receptor-2A (SUR2A) subunits as well as the A site of SUR1 subunit of the channel to promote insulin secretion from the beta cell.[A177715] ', 'Glimepiride stimulates the secretion of insulin granules from the pancreatic beta cells and improves the sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin to increase peripheral glucose uptake, thus reducing plasma blood glucose levels and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels.

Hyperuricemia is closely related to gout, whereby it may exist for many years before the first clinical attack of gout; thus, aberrated serum uric acid levels and hyperuricemia are believed to be the biochemical aberration involved in the pathogenesis of gout.[A230548] Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) can act as a xanthine oxidase or xanthine dehydrogenase. In humans, it is a critical enzyme for uric acid production as it catalyzes the oxidation reaction steps from hypoxanthine to xanthine and from xanthine to uric acid in the pathway of purine metabolism.[A19658] Febuxostat potently inhibits XOR, blocking both its oxidase and dehydrogenase activities. With high affinity, febuxostat binds to XOR in a molecular channel leading to the molybdenum-pterin active site, where [allopurinol] demonstrates relatively weak competitive inhibition.[A230548] 



XOR is mainly found in the dehydrogenase form under normal physiological conditions; however, in inflammatory conditions, XOR can be converted into the xanthine oxidase form, which catalyzes reactions that produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as peroxynitrite. ROS contribute to vascular inflammation and alterations in vascular function. As febuxostat can inhibit both forms of XOR, it can inhibit ROS formation, oxidative stress, and inflammation.[A2743] In a rat model, febuxostat suppressed renal ischemia-reperfusion injury by attenuating oxidative stress.[A2744]', 'Febuxostat is a novel, selective xanthine oxidase/dehydrogenase inhibitor that works by decreasing serum uric acid in a dose-dependent manner. In healthy subjects, febuxostat decreased the mean serum uric acid and serum xanthine concentrations, as well as the total urinary uric acid excretion. Febuxostat at daily doses of 40-80 mg reduced the 24-hour mean serum uric acid concentrations by 40 to 55%.[L32238] Closely related to the drug-induced reduction of serum uric acid levels and mobilization of urate crystals in tissue deposits, febuxostat is associated with gout flares.[A230583] 



Unlike [allopurinol] and [oxypurinol], febuxostat has no inhibitory actions against other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism, because it does not structurally resemble purines or pyrimidines.[A230548] ', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Depolarization leads to activation and opening of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and consequently an influx of calcium ions into the cell.[A177727] Elevated intracellular calcium levels causes the contraction of the filaments of actomyosin responsible for the exocytosis of insulin granules stored in vesicles.[A177715] Glimepiride blocks the ATP-sensitive potassium channel by binding non-specifically to the B sites of both sulfonylurea receptor-1 (SUR1) and sulfonylurea receptor-2A (SUR2A) subunits as well as the A site of SUR1 subunit of the channel to promote insulin secretion from the beta cell.[A177715] ', 'Glimepiride stimulates the secretion of insulin granules from the pancreatic beta cells and improves the sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin to increase peripheral glucose uptake, thus reducing plasma blood glucose levels and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels.

Characterized by higher-than-normal levels of blood glucose, T2DM is a complex disorder that arises from the interaction between genetic, environmental and behavioral risk factors. Insulin is a peptide hormone that plays a critical role in regulating blood glucose levels. In response to high blood glucose levels, insulin promotes the uptake of glucose into the liver, muscle cells, and fat cells for storage. Although there are multiple events occurring that lead to the pathophysiology of T2DM, the disorder mainly involves insulin insensitivity as a result of insulin resistance, declining insulin production, and eventual failure of beta cells of pancreatic islets that normally produce insulin.[A179554] Early management with lifestyle intervention, such as controlled diet and exercise, is critical in reducing the risk of long-term secondary complications, such as cardiovascular mortality.



Glipizide, like other sulfonylurea drugs, is an insulin secretagogue, which works by stimulating the insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells thereby increasing the plasma concentrations of insulin.[A177715] Thus, the main therapeutic action of the drug depends on the functional beta cells in the pancreatic islets.[L6739] Sulfonylureas bind to the sulfonylurea receptor expressed on the pancreatic beta-cell plasma membrane, leading to the closure of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel and reduced potassium conductance. This results in depolarization of the pancreatic beta cell and opening of the voltage-sensitive calcium channels, promoting calcium ion influx. Increased intracellular concentrations of calcium ions in beta cells stimulates the secretion, or exocytosis, of insulin granules from the cells.[label,T28] Apart from this main mechanism of action, the blood-glucose-lowering effect of glipizide involves increased peripheral glucose utilization via stimulating hepatic gluconeogenesis and by increasing the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors.[A177715]', 'Glipizide is a blood glucose-lowering agent. The initial onset of blood glucose-lowering effect occurs around 30 minutes post-administration with the duration of action lasting for about 12 to 24 hours.[L6739] While the chronic use of glipizide does not result in elevations in the fasting insulin levels over time, the postprandial insulin response, or insulin response to a meal, is observed to be enhanced, even after 6 months of treatment.[label] The main therapeutic actions of glipizide primarily occur at the pancreas where the insulin release is stimulated, but glipizide also mediates some extrapancreatic effects, such as the promotion of insulin signaling effects on the muscles, fat, or liver cells.[L6745] Due to its action on the endogenous cells, sulfonylureas including glipizide is associated with a risk for developing hypoglycemia and weight gain in patients receiving the drug.[A179554,T28] Chronic administration of glipizide may result in down-regulation of the sulfonylurea receptors on pancreatic beta cells, which are molecular targets of the drug, leading to a reduced effect on insulin secretion.[A177715] 



Like other sulfonylureas, glipizide may work on pancreatic delta (δ) cells and alpha (α) cells to stimulate the secretion of somatostatin and suppress the secretion of glucagon, which are peptide hormones that regulate neuroendocrine and metabolic pathways. Other than its primary action on the pancreas, glipizide also exerts other biological actions outside of the pancreas, or "extrapancreatic effects", which is similar to other members of the sulfonylurea drug class. Glipizide may enhance the glucose uptake into the skeletal muscles and potentiate the action of insulin in the liver. Other effects include inhibited lipolysis in the liver and adipose tissue, inhibited hepatic glucose output, and increased uptake and oxidation of glucose. It has also been demonstrated by several studies that the chronic therapeutic use of sulfonylureas may result in an increase in insulin receptors expressed on monocytes, adipocytes, and erythrocytes.[A177715]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

It is estimated that the activity of GLP-1 and GIP contribute more than 70% to the insulin response to an oral glucose challenge. They stimulate insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner via G-protein-coupled GIP and GLP-1 receptor signalling. In addition to their effects on insulin secretion, GLP-1 is also involved in promoting islet neogenesis and differentiation, as well as attenuating pancreatic beta-cell apoptosis. Incretin hormones also exert extra-pancreatic effects, such as lipogenesis and myocardial function.[A232523] In type II diabetes mellitus, GLP-1 secretion is impaired, and the insulinotropic effect of GIP is significantly diminished.[A232488]



Vildagliptin exerts its blood glucose-lowering effects by selectively inhibiting dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), an enzyme that rapidly truncates and inactivates GLP-1 and GIP upon their release from the intestinal cells. DPP-4 cleaves oligopeptides after the second amino acid from the N-terminal end. Inhibition of DPP-4 substantially prolongs the half-life of GLP-1 and GIP, increasing the levels of active circulating incretin hormones.[A232523] The duration of DPP-4 inhibition by vildagliptin is dose-dependent.[A232533] Vildagliptin reduces fasting and prandial glucose and HbA1c. It enhances the glucose sensitivity of alpha- and beta-cells and augments glucose-dependent insulin secretion. Fasting and postprandial glucose levels are decreased, and postprandial lipid and lipoprotein metabolism are also improved.[A232488,A232528]', 'Vildagliptin works to improve glycemic control in type II diabetes mellitus by enhancing the glucose sensitivity of beta-cells (β-cells) in pancreatic islets and promoting glucose-dependent insulin secretion. Increased GLP-1 levels leads to enhanced sensitivity of alpha cells to glucose, promoting glucagon secretion. Vildagliptin causes an increase in the insulin to glucagon ratio by increasing incretin hormone levels: this results in a decrease in fasting and postprandial hepatic glucose production. Vildagliptin does not affect gastric emptying. It also has no effects on insulin secretion or blood glucose levels in individuals with normal glycemic control.[L32803]



In clinical trials, treatment with vildagliptin 50-100 mg daily in patients with type 2 diabetes significantly improved markers of beta-cells, proinsulin to insulin ratio, and measures of beta-cell responsiveness from the frequently-sampled meal tolerance test.

**Metformin combination products**



Metformin is a component of a variety of combination products with other anti-diabetic agents. It is indicated, along with diet and exercise, to improve glycemic control in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in combination with DPP-4 inhibitors ([sitagliptin], [linagliptin], [alogliptin], or [saxagliptin]),[L11479,L40248,L40253,L40258,L40263] in combination with SGLT2 inhibitors ([canagliflozin], [empagliflozin], [ertugliflozin], or [dapagliflozin]),[L11479,L30503,L1134,L13679,L38729] or in combination with [pioglitazone].[L11419]', 'Metformin''s mechanisms of action are unique from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic drugs. Metformin decreases blood glucose levels by decreasing hepatic glucose production (also called gluconeogenesis), decreasing the intestinal absorption of glucose, and increasing insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.[L12207] It is well established that metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I activity, and it has since been generally postulated that its potent antidiabetic effects occur through this mechanism.[A36534, A36557]   The above processes lead to a decrease in blood glucose, managing type II diabetes and exerting positive effects on glycemic control.



After ingestion, the organic cation transporter-1 (OCT1) is responsible for the uptake of metformin into hepatocytes (liver cells). As this drug is positively charged, it accumulates in cells and in the mitochondria because of the membrane potentials across the plasma membrane as well as the mitochondrial inner membrane. Metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I, preventing the production of mitochondrial ATP leading to increased cytoplasmic ADP:ATP and AMP:ATP ratios.[A36534] These changes activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an enzyme that plays an important role in the regulation of glucose metabolism.[A176348] Aside from this mechanism, AMPK can be activated by a lysosomal mechanism involving other activators.  Following this process, increases in AMP:ATP ratio also inhibit _fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase_ enzyme, resulting in the inhibition of gluconeogenesis, while also inhibiting _adenylate cyclase_ and decreasing the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP),[A36534] a derivative of ATP used for cell signaling [A176351]. Activated AMPK phosphorylates two isoforms of acetyl-CoA carboxylase enzyme, thereby inhibiting fat synthesis and leading to fat oxidation, reducing hepatic lipid stores and increasing liver sensitivity to insulin.[A36534] 



In the intestines, metformin increases anaerobic glucose metabolism in enterocytes (intestinal cells), leading to reduced net glucose uptake and increased delivery of lactate to the liver. Recent studies have also implicated the gut as a primary site of action of metformin and suggest that the liver may not be as important for metformin action in patients with type 2 diabetes. Some of the ways metformin may play a role on the intestines is by promoting the metabolism of glucose by increasing glucagon-like peptide I (GLP-1) as well as increasing gut utilization of glucose.[A36534] 



In addition to the above pathway, the mechanism of action of metformin may be explained by other ways, and its exact mechanism of action has been under extensive study in recent years.[A36535, A36554, A36555, A36557]', '**General effects**



Insulin is an important hormone that regulates blood glucose levels.[T514] Type II diabetes is characterized by a decrease in sensitivity to insulin, resulting in elevations in blood glucose when the pancreas can no longer compensate. In patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, insulin is unable to exert adequate effects on tissues and cells (i.e. insulin resistance)[T514] and insulin deficiency may also be present.[L5753]



Metformin reduces hepatic production of glucose, decreases the intestinal absorption of glucose, and enhances insulin sensitivity by increasing both peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. In contrast with drugs of the sulfonylurea class, which lead to hyperinsulinemia, the secretion of insulin is unchanged with metformin use.[L12207]

The hetero-octomeric complex of the channel is composed of four pore-forming Kir6.2 subunits and four regulatory sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) subunits. Alternative splicing allows the formation of channels composed of varying subunit isoforms expressed at different concentrations in different tissues.[A177730] In pancreatic beta cells, ATP-sensitive potassium channels play a role as essential metabolic sensors and regulators that couple membrane excitability with glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS).[A177727] When there is a decrease in the ATP:ADP ratio, the channels are activated and open, leading to K+ efflux from the cell, membrane hyperpolarization, and suppression of insulin secretion.[A177727] In contrast, increased uptake of glucose into the cell leads to elevated intracellular ATP:ADP ratio, leading to the closure of channels and membrane depolarization. Depolarization leads to activation and opening of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and consequently an influx of calcium ions into the cell.[A177727] Elevated intracellular calcium levels causes the contraction of the filaments of actomyosin responsible for the exocytosis of insulin granules stored in vesicles.[A177715] Glimepiride blocks the ATP-sensitive potassium channel by binding non-specifically to the B sites of both sulfonylurea receptor-1 (SUR1) and sulfonylurea receptor-2A (SUR2A) subunits as well as the A site of SUR1 subunit of the channel to promote insulin secretion from the beta cell.[A177715] ', 'Glimepiride stimulates the secretion of insulin granules from the pancreatic beta cells and improves the sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin to increase peripheral glucose uptake, thus reducing plasma blood glucose levels and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels.

Vildagliptin is also marketed in a combination product with [metformin] for the treatment of adults with type II diabetes mellitus who inadequately respond to either monotherapy of vildagliptin or metformin. This fixed-dose formulation can be used in combination with a sulphonylurea or insulin (i.e., triple therapy) as an adjunct to diet and exercise in adults who do not achieve adequate glycemic control with monotherapy or dual therapy.[L32813]', 'Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) are incretin hormones that regulate blood glucose levels and maintain glucose homeostasis. It is estimated that the activity of GLP-1 and GIP contribute more than 70% to the insulin response to an oral glucose challenge. They stimulate insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner via G-protein-coupled GIP and GLP-1 receptor signalling. In addition to their effects on insulin secretion, GLP-1 is also involved in promoting islet neogenesis and differentiation, as well as attenuating pancreatic beta-cell apoptosis. Incretin hormones also exert extra-pancreatic effects, such as lipogenesis and myocardial function.[A232523] In type II diabetes mellitus, GLP-1 secretion is impaired, and the insulinotropic effect of GIP is significantly diminished.[A232488]



Vildagliptin exerts its blood glucose-lowering effects by selectively inhibiting dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), an enzyme that rapidly truncates and inactivates GLP-1 and GIP upon their release from the intestinal cells. DPP-4 cleaves oligopeptides after the second amino acid from the N-terminal end. Inhibition of DPP-4 substantially prolongs the half-life of GLP-1 and GIP, increasing the levels of active circulating incretin hormones.[A232523] The duration of DPP-4 inhibition by vildagliptin is dose-dependent.[A232533] Vildagliptin reduces fasting and prandial glucose and HbA1c. It enhances the glucose sensitivity of alpha- and beta-cells and augments glucose-dependent insulin secretion. Fasting and postprandial glucose levels are decreased, and postprandial lipid and lipoprotein metabolism are also improved.[A232488,A232528]', 'Vildagliptin works to improve glycemic control in type II diabetes mellitus by enhancing the glucose sensitivity of beta-cells (β-cells) in pancreatic islets and promoting glucose-dependent insulin secretion. Increased GLP-1 levels leads to enhanced sensitivity of alpha cells to glucose, promoting glucagon secretion. Vildagliptin causes an increase in the insulin to glucagon ratio by increasing incretin hormone levels: this results in a decrease in fasting and postprandial hepatic glucose production. Vildagliptin does not affect gastric emptying. It also has no effects on insulin secretion or blood glucose levels in individuals with normal glycemic control.[L32803]



In clinical trials, treatment with vildagliptin 50-100 mg daily in patients with type 2 diabetes significantly improved markers of beta-cells, proinsulin to insulin ratio, and measures of beta-cell responsiveness from the frequently-sampled meal tolerance test.

V2 receptors are predominantly expressed on the basolateral membrane of the distal tubule and collecting ducts of the kidney: these receptors are responsible for the antidiuretic effect of vasopressin, regulating water permeability of kidney tubules and therefore maintaining water homeostasis.[A2601] V3 receptors mediate the effects of vasopressin on the central nervous system.[A2605] 



Vasopressin is considered a stress hormone as it is released into the bloodstream in response to various volume and pressure stimuli, such as pain, surgery, syncope and shock.[A2601, A2605, A252677] Shock conditions such as hypovolemia initially cause an increase in the release of vasopressin to maintain organ perfusion; however, as the shock state progresses, plasma vasopressin concentrations decrease due to several causes such as depleted stores of vasopressin in refractory shock and a central inhibitory effect of initially elevated vasopressin levels on further vasopressin release.[A2605]



Terlipressin is a synthetic vasopressin analogue that can cause sustained increases in blood pressure in patients with shock conditions.[A2605] It exhibits twice the selectivity for vasopressin V1 receptors versus V2 receptors. Terlipressin is pharmacologically active but acts as a prodrug for [lypressin] (also known as lysine vasopressin), a vasoconstrictor and antidiuretic agent. The exact mechanism of action of terlipressin is not fully understood; however, terlipressin works to cause vasoconstriction in shock and other conditions associated with vasodilation. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is caused by splanchnic and systemic arterial vasodilation along with a reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cardiac output, resulting in a marked decrease in effective circulating volume.[A252672] Terlipressin is thought to increase renal blood flow in patients with HRS-1 by reducing portal hypertension and blood circulation in portal vessels and increasing effective arterial volume and mean arterial pressure (MAP).[L43217]', 'Terlipressin mimics the biological effects of endogenous vasopressin, but it displays increased selectivity for the V1 receptor and a longer half-life than vasopressin.

Terlipressin increases arterial pressure (diastolic, systolic, and mean) and decreases heart rate in patients with hepatorenal syndrome type 1 (HRS-1). After the administration of a single 0.85 mg dose of terlipressin in patients with HRS-1, cardiovascular effects were observed within five minutes after dosing and were maintained for at least six hours after dosing.

', '**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].



Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].



In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].



There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].



Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].



The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. 



In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].



In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].



The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].', 'Zinc is involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of human proteins may bind zinc, in addition to hundreds of proteins that transport and traffic zinc. It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is an essential element for a proper sense of taste and smell and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations [L2211].



Studies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions [L2095]:



**Colds:** Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently [L2095].



**Wound healing:** Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements [L2095].

', 'It is suggested that aloe polysaccharides mediate skin-protectant effects in damaged skin, induced by internal or other external factors such as radiation, via inhibiting apoptosis of normal cell lines _in vitro_ and thrombocytes _in vivo_ [A32473]. Following irradiation, aloe polysaccharides block the upregulation of pro-apoptotic p53, Bax, and Bad while blocking downregulating anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 [A32473]. _In vivo_, aloe polysaccharides may act as a scavenger for oxygen free radicals including DPPH, alkyl radicals, superoxides, and singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals that may also be generated by superoxides [A32470, A32476]. Hydrogen peroxide, which is a weak initiate lipid peroxidation, may also be effectively scavenged by aloe polysaccharides [A32476]. In a Fenton reaction system, aloe polysaccharides demonstrated a concentration-dependent scavenging activity against hydroxyl radical that were generated during the reaction [A32476]. Aloe polysaccharides may also compete with oxygen to react with nitric oxide (NO), thereby inhibiting the generation of nitrite and peroxynitrite anions that act as free radicals [A32476]. 



Findings from a study investigating the effects of aloe polysaccharides on doxorubicin-induced oxidative stress suggest that aloe polysaccharides mediate potent antioxidant actions _in vivo_ [A32476]. Doxorubicin, known to generate reactive oxygen species such as superoxide and hydroxy radicals, was administered to albino rats. This led to myocardial oxidative stress and cardiac injury accompanied by leakage of LDH and CPK from cardiac myocytes and to serum due to lipid peroxidation of cardiac membranes, reduced levels of antioxidant coenzyme GSH, and increased levels of SOD from a compensatory and combative mechanism of oxidative stress [A32476]. Treatment with aloe polysaccharides resulted in a significant decrease in serum LDH and CPK levels, indicating that aloe polysaccharides are capable in stabilizing cardiac membranes from peroxidative damage. Restored levels of endogenous GSH and SOD in a dose-dependent manner were also observed with the treatment of aloe polysaccharides, suggesting that aloe polysaccharides exhibit potent antioxidant properties [A32476].



In a study of rats with open cutaneous back wounds, treatment with aloe polysaccharides decreased the levels of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) and induced tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) during the early stage of wound repair, resulting in decreased collagen breakdown and increased preservation of collagen content in the injured area [A32471]. A study proposes that acemannan, a common aloe polysaccharide, stimulates BMSC proliferation, ALPase activity, expression of VEGF, BMP-2, OPN, BSP, and mineralization leading to osteoblast differentiation and bone formation during socket healing [A32475]. ', 'Aloe polysaccharides mediate antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions, as well as immunoregulatory activities. Various studies indicate that aloe polysaccharides possess effective free radical scavenging activity _in vitro_, and produce potent antioxidant potential during oxidative stress _in vivo_ [A32476]. According to the findings of studies _in vitro_ and _in vivo_, aloe polysaccharides exhibit radioprotective activity. Treatment with acemmanan, which is a common aloe polysaccharide, on CH3 mice with radiation-induced skin reactions resulted in reduced signs of those reactions [A32473]. Studies suggest that aloe polysaccharides may evidently attenuate tumor growth in mice [A32473]. Treatment of aloe polysaccharides in Vero cells as well as in the in vivo zebrafish model led to protective effects against AAPH-indued oxidative stress resulting from accumulation of free radical species and improved cell viability [A32470].

It is converted by the thrombin/thrombomodulin-complex on the endothelial cell surface to Activated Protein C (APC). Once in its activated form, APC functions as a serine protease with potent anticoagulant effects, especially in the presence of its cofactor protein S. APC exerts its effect by inactivating essential components of the coagulation cascade (specifically factors V and VIII), which leads to a decrease in thrombin formation, and therefore a reduction in clot formation.

This is the event that triggers the nerve impulse to the brain which allows for the perception of light. All-<i>trans</i>-retinal is then released from opsin and reduced to all-<i>trans</i>-retinol. All-<i>trans</i>-retinol is isomerized to 11-<i>cis</i>-retinol in the dark, and then oxidized to 11-<i>cis</i>-retinal. 11-<i>cis</i>-retinal recombines with opsin to re-form rhodopsin.

It is often used in combination with [misoprostol] as a gastro-protective agent in patients with high risk of developing NSAID-induced ulcers.', 'Diclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 and -2, the enzymes responsible for production of prostaglandin (PG) G<sub>2</sub> which is the precursor to other PGs.[label,T116] These molecules have broad activity in pain and inflammation and the inhibition of their production is the common mechanism linking each effect of diclofenac.



PGE<sub>2</sub> is the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.[A179023] It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.[T116,A179023] PGE<sub>2</sub> activates the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled EP<sub>1</sub> receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE<sub>2</sub> also activates the EP<sub>4</sub> receptor, coupled to G<sub>s</sub>, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE<sub>2</sub> act via EP<sub>3</sub> to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP<sub>2</sub> to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI<sub>2</sub> is known to play a role via its G<sub>s</sub>-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.



PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP<sub>2</sub> receptors.[T116,A179044] Similarly to β adrenergic receptors these are G<sub>s</sub>-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE<sub>2</sub> also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.[T116] PGD<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP<sub>1</sub> receptor.[A179044] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.



PGE<sub>2</sub> can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory G<sub>q</sub> EP<sub>3</sub> receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.[T116] This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever. NSAIDs prevent the generation of PGE<sub>2</sub> thereby reducing the activity of these neurons.

', 'The dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor is a 7-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor associated with G<sub>i</sub> proteins. In lactotrophs, stimulation of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> causes inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, which decreases intracellular cAMP concentrations and blocks IP3-dependent release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores. Decreases in intracellular calcium levels may also be brought about via inhibition of calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels, rather than via inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Additionally, receptor activation blocks phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK and decreases MAPK/ERK kinase phosphorylation. Inhibition of MAPK appears to be mediated by c-Raf and B-Raf-dependent inhibition of MAPK/ERK kinase. Dopamine-stimulated growth hormone release from the pituitary gland is mediated by a decrease in intracellular calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels rather than via adenylyl cyclase inhibition. Stimulation of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway leads to improvements in coordinated muscle activity in those with movement disorders. Cabergoline is a long-acting dopamine receptor agonist with a high affinity for D2 receptors. Receptor-binding studies indicate that cabergoline has low affinity for dopamine D1, &alpha;<sub>1</sub>,- and &alpha;<sub>2</sub>- adrenergic, and 5-HT<sub>1</sub>- and 5-HT<sub>2</sub>-serotonin receptors.', 'Cabergoline stimulates centrally-located dopaminergic receptors resulting in a number of pharmacologic effects. Five dopamine receptor types from two dopaminergic subfamilies have been identified. The dopaminergic D1 receptor subfamily consists of D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>5</sub> subreceptors, which are associated with dyskinesias. The dopaminergic D2 receptor subfamily consists of D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub> and D<sub>4</sub> subreceptors, which are associated with improvement of symptoms of movement disorders. Thus, agonist activity specific for D2 subfamily receptors, primarily D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> receptor subtypes, are the primary targets of dopaminergic antiparkinsonian agents. It is thought that postsynaptic D2 stimulation is primarily responsible for the antiparkinsonian effect of dopamine agonists, while presynaptic D2 stimulation confers neuroprotective effects. This semisynthetic ergot derivative exhibits potent agonist activity on dopamine D<sub>2</sub>- and D<sub>3</sub>-receptors. It also exhibits: agonist activity (in order of decreasing binding affinities) on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)<sub>2B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>, dopamine D<sub>4</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, dopamine D<sub>1</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors and antagonist activity on &alpha;<sub>2B</sub>, &alpha;<sub>2A</sub>, and &alpha;<sub>2C</sub> receptors. Parkinsonian Syndrome manifests when approximately 80% of dopaminergic activity in the nigrostriatal pathway of the brain is lost. As this striatum is involved in modulating the intensity of coordinated muscle activity (e.g. movement, balance, walking), loss of activity may result in dystonia (acute muscle contraction), Parkinsonism (including symptoms of bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, and flattened affect), akathesia (inner restlessness), tardive dyskinesia (involuntary muscle movements usually associated with long-term loss of dopaminergic activity), and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which manifests when complete blockage of nigrostriatal dopamine occurs. High dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain causes hallucinations and delusions; these side effects of dopamine agonists are manifestations seen in patients with schizophrenia who have overractivity in this area of the brain. The hallucinogenic side effects of dopamine agonists may also be due to 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> agonism. The tuberoinfundibular pathway of the brain originates in the hypothalamus and terminates in the pituitary gland. In this pathway, dopamine inhibits lactotrophs in anterior pituitary from secreting prolactin. Increased dopaminergic activity in the tuberoinfundibular pathway inhibits prolactin secretion.

Eventually, cell lysis may occur due to weakening of the cell wall, and loss of turgor pressure and subsequent rupture of the cytoplasmic membrane [A32441].

This binding results in displacement of divalent cations and increased membrane permeability, allowing for aminoglycoside entry.[A232294, A232304, A232309, A232314]

The second “energy-dependent phase I” of aminoglycoside entry into the cytoplasm relies on the proton-motive force and allows a limited amount of aminoglycoside access to its primary intracellular target - the bacterial 30S ribosome.[A232294, A232314] This ultimately results in the mistranslation of proteins and disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane.[A233320] Finally, in the “energy-dependent phase II” stage, concentration-dependent bacterial killing is observed. Aminoglycoside rapidly accumulates in the cell due to the damaged cytoplasmic membrane, and protein mistranslation and synthesis inhibition is amplified.[A232294, A232314, A232319] The necessity of oxygen-dependent active transport explains why aminoglycosides are ineffective against anaerobic bacteria.[A234130]

Hence, aminoglycosides have both immediate bactericidal effects through membrane disruption and delayed bactericidal effects through impaired protein synthesis; observed experimental data and mathematical modeling support this two-mechanism model.[A232294, A232299]

Inhibition of protein synthesis is a key component of aminoglycoside efficacy. Structural and cell biological studies suggest that aminoglycosides bind to the 16S rRNA in helix 44 (h44), near the A site of the 30S ribosomal subunit, altering interactions between h44 and h45. This binding also displaces two important residues, A1492 and A1493, from h44, mimicking normal conformational changes that occur with successful codon-anticodon pairing in the A site.[A232324, A232329] Overall, aminoglycoside binding has several negative effects including inhibition of translation, initiation, elongation, and ribosome recycling.[A232294, A232334, A232339] Recent evidence suggests that the latter effect is due to a cryptic second binding site situated in h69 of the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit.[A232329, A232339] Also, by stabilizing a conformation that mimics correct codon-anticodon pairing, aminoglycosides promote error-prone translation.[A232344] Mistranslated proteins can incorporate into the cell membrane, inducing the damage discussed above.[A232294, A232319]', NULL, 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Off-label uses: irritable bowel syndrome, sleep disorders, diabetic neuropathy, agitation, fibromyalgia, and insomnia ', 'The mechanism of action of this drug is not fully elucidated. It is suggested that amitriptyline inhibits the membrane pump mechanism responsible for the re-uptake of transmitter amines, such as norepinephrine and serotonin, thereby increasing their concentration at the synaptic clefts of the brain [FDA label], [A174673].   These amines are important in regulating mood.  The monoamine hypothesis in depression, one of the oldest hypotheses, postulates that deficiencies of serotonin (5-HT) and/or norepinephrine (NE) neurotransmission in the brain lead to depressive effects [A174670].   This drug counteracts these mechanisms, and this may be the mechanism of amitriptyline in improving depressive symptoms.



Whether its analgesic effects are related to its mood-altering activities or attributable to a different, less obvious pharmacological action (or a combination of both) is unknown [A174661].', '**Effects in pain and depression**



Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant and an analgesic. It has anticholinergic and sedative properties [FDA label]. 

Clinical studies have shown that oral amitriptyline achieves, at a minimum, good to moderate response in up to 2/3 of patients diagnosed with post-herpetic neuralgia and 3/4 of patients diagnosed with diabetic neuropathic pain, and neurogenic pain syndromes that are frequently unresponsive to narcotic analgesics. Amitriptyline has also shown efficacy in diverse groups of patients with chronic non-malignant pain. There have also been some studies showing efficacy in managing fibromyalgia (an off-label use of this drug) [A174658], [A174667].



**Cardiovascular and Anticholinergic Effects**



Amitriptyline has strong anticholinergic properties and may cause ECG changes and quinidine-like effects on the heart [F3454]. Amitriptyline may inhibit ion channels, which are necessary for cardiac repolarization (hERG channels), in the upper micromolar range of therapeutic plasma concentrations. Therefore, amitriptyline may increase the risk for cardiac arrhythmia [FDA label]. Orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia can be a problem in elderly patients receiving this drug at normal doses for depression. There is evidence in the literature that these effects may occur, rarely, at the lower dosages utilized in the treatment of pain. As with any other tricyclic antidepressant agent, increased glucose levels can occur with amitriptyline [A174661].

', '**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].



Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].



In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].



There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].



Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].



The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. 



In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].



In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].



The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].', 'Zinc is involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of human proteins may bind zinc, in addition to hundreds of proteins that transport and traffic zinc. It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is an essential element for a proper sense of taste and smell and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations [L2211].



Studies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions [L2095]:



**Colds:** Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently [L2095].



**Wound healing:** Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements [L2095]. 



**Diahrrea**: Oral zinc supplements can reduce the symptoms of diarrhea in children with low levels of zinc, especially in cases of malnutrition [L2095].

Trimebutine is suggested to bind to the inactivated state of the calcium channel with high affinity. Reduced calcium influx attenuates membrane depolarization and decrease colon peristalsis. It also inhibits outward K+ currents in response to membrane depolarization of the GI smooth muscle cells at resting conditions through inhibition of delayed rectifier K+ channels and Ca2+ dependent K+ channels, which results in induced muscle contractions [A19691, A19695]. Trimebutine binds to mu opioid receptors with more selectivity compared to delta or kappa opioid receptors but with lower affinity than their natural ligands. Its metabolites (N-monodesmethyl-trimebutine or nor-trimebutine), are also shown to bind to opoid receptors on brain membranes and myenteric synaptosomes [A19692]. ', 'Trimebutine is a spasmolytic agent that acts directly on smooth muscle to modulate gastric motility. It shows a "dual function" that stimulates or inhibits spontaneous contractions depending on the concentration and prior contractile activity in the preparation. Targeting ion conductance that regulates GI motility, trimebutine inhibits the inward calcium currents and calcium-dependent potassium currents in a concentration-dependent manner [A19691]. At lower concentrations (1-10uM), trimebutine depolarizes the resting membrane potential without affecting the amplitude of contractions, which is thought to be mediated by inhibition of outward potassium currents. It is also shown to activate T-type Ca2+ channel and increase gastric emptying, intestinal and colonic contractility [A19690]. At higher concentrations (100-300uM), reduced amplitude of spontaneous contractions and action potentials is thought to be mediated by inhibition of L-type Ca2+ channels and inward calcium current [A19691].

An extended-release combination product containing empagliflozin, metformin, and linagliptin was approved by the FDA in January 2020 for the improvement of glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus when used adjunctively with diet and exercise.[L11479]



Empagliflozin is also approved to reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization due to heart failure in adult patients with heart failure, either alone or in combination with metformin.[L13688, L45578] It is also indicated in adults to reduce the risk of sustained decline in eGFR, end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization in adults with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression.[L40778, L48255]



Empagliflozin is not approved for use in patients with type 1 diabetes.', 'The vast majority of glucose filtered through the glomerulus is reabsorbed within the proximal tubule, primarily via SGLT2 (sodium-glucose linked co-transporter-2) which is responsible for ~90% of the total glucose reabsorption within the kidneys. Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase on the basolateral membrane of proximal tubular cells utilize ATP to actively pump Na+ ions into the interstitium surrounding the tubule, establishing a Na<sup>+</sup> gradient within the tubular cell. SGLT2 on the apical membrane of these cells then utilize this gradient to facilitate secondary active co-transport of both Na+ and glucose out of the filtrate, thereby reabsorbing glucose back into the blood – inhibiting this co-transport, then, allows for a marked increase in glucosuria and decrease in blood glucose levels.[A203453] Empagliflozin is a potent inhibitor of renal SGLT2 transporters located in the proximal tubules of the kidneys and works to lower blood glucose levels via an increase in glucosuria.[L13688]



Empagliflozin also appears to exert cardiovascular benefits - specifically in the prevention of heart failure - independent of its blood glucose-lowering effects, though the exact mechanism of this benefit is not precisely understood. Several theories have been posited, including the potential inhibition of Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger (NHE) 1 in the myocardium and NHE3 in the proximal tubule, reduction of pre-load via diuretic/natriuretic effects and reduction of blood pressure, prevention of cardiac fibrosis via suppression of pro-fibrotic markers, and reduction of pro-inflammatory adipokines.[A203456]', 'Empagliflozin lowers blood glucose levels by preventing glucose reabsorption in the kidneys, thereby increasing the amount of glucose excreted in the urine.[L13688] It has a relatively long duration of action requiring only once-daily dosing. Patients should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis regardless of blood glucose level as empagliflozin may precipitate diabetic ketoacidosis in the absence of hyperglycemia.[L13688] As its mechanism of action is contingent on the renal excretion of glucose, empagliflozin may be held in cases of acute kidney injury and/or discontinued in patients who develop chronic renal disease.

Hyaluronic acid works by two basic mechanisms: serving as a passive structural molecule or serving as signaling molecule, depending on the molecule size. The physicochemical properties of high molecular weight HA contribute to passive structural effects, demonstrating hygroscopicity and viscoelasticity and improving hydration, water balance, and structural integrity. As a signalling  molecule interacting with proteins, HA causes several opposing effects based on molecular weight: pro- or anti-inflammatory effects, promotion or inhibition of cell migration, and activating or inhibiting cell division.[A230133] 



Hyaluronic acid exerts its therapeutic effects through binding to three primary types of cell surface receptors: CD44 (a membrane glycoprotein), the receptor for hyaluronate-mediated motility (RHAMM), and the Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1). CD44 is considered the most widely distributed receptor for hyaluronic acid, demonstrating cellular interactions with osteopontin, collagen, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).  High and low molecular weight hyaluronic acids demonstrate differing molecular and cellular mechanisms in their interaction with CD44 receptors. Some examples of these effects include modification of chondrocyte survival pathways in addition to alteration of apoptosis pathways.  Lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor (LYVE-1), and hyaluronic acid receptor for endocytosis (HARE), (also known as Stabilin-2) also bind to hyaluronic acid.[A230128] 



Hyaluronic acid for skin conditions and cosmetics



Hyaluronic acid''s anionic proprieties cause it to attract water and induce swelling, increasing tissue volume and skin structural integrity. The aging process is associated with reduced production of skin hyaluronic acid and collagen, causing the appearance of wrinkles and the loss of facial volume. Dermal fillers of hyaluronic acid replace lost tissue volume, imparting a full and youthful appearance to skin that has lost its elasticity. Hyaluronic acid fillers contain cross-linked hyaluronic acid particles, rendering a concentrated substance with resistance to various forms of physical and chemical breakdown. The cosmetic benefits of hyaluronic acid filler may last up to 6 months, depending on the brand and technique used for injection.[L32193] Additionally, dermal hyaluronic acid fillers are known to increase the production of fibroblasts[L32193], supporting wound healing and offering relief from irritating and inflammatory skin conditions.[A230118]





Hyaluronic acid for joint pain



Most cells in the human body are capable of synthesizing HA. It is a primary component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and can be found in bone marrow, cartilage, and synovial fluid in joints.[A230128] In osteoarthritis, the concentration of naturally occurring hyaluronic acid gradually decreases, lowering the viscosity of synovial fluid that protects joints from excess friction. Administration of intra-articular hyaluronic acid increases viscosity of synovial joint fluid, reducing friction and subsequently relieving painful arthritic symptoms.[L32193]





Hyaluronic acid for ophthalmic conditions and ophthalmological procedures



Solutions of hyaluronic acid with a concentration greater than 0.1% moisturize the surface of the eyes to treat symptoms of dry eye while improving the stabilization of tear film, replenishing deficiencies of HA, reducing friction, and preventing binding of foreign substances to the ocular tissue.[A230128,L32193] Hyaluronic acid is frequently used during and after ophthalmological surgeries and plays important roles by virtue of its moisturizing, viscoelastic, and protective properties. It promotes tissue healing of the corneal epithelium and other parts of the eye following ophthalmological surgery, minimizing the risk of adhesions and free radical formation.[A230128]

', 'HA has long-acting lubricant, shock absorbing, joint stabilizing, and water balancing properties.[A230128,L32193] It is similar to the naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan (GAG) in joints. Hyaluronic acid works by acting as a lubricant and shock absorber, facilitating joint mobility and thereby reducing osteoarthritic pain.  Hyaluronic acid has antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic effects.[A230128] The water-balancing properties and viscoelasticity of hyaluronic acid are beneficial in cosmetic injections, imparting volume and reducing the appearance of imperfections and wrinkles.[L32193] Due to the abovementioned properties, HA has a protective effect on the eyes and cornea.[A230133]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Using vitamin B12 as a cofactor, folic acid can normalize high homocysteine levels by remethylation of homocysteine to methionine via methionine synthetase.', 'Folic acid is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin found in foods such as liver, kidney, yeast, and leafy, green vegetables. Also known as folate or Vitamin B9, folic acid is an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in DNA and RNA synthesis. More specifically, folic acid is required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. Folic acid is the precursor of tetrahydrofolic acid, which is involved as a cofactor for transformylation reactions in the biosynthesis of purines and thymidylates of nucleic acids. Impairment of thymidylate synthesis in patients with folic acid deficiency is thought to account for the defective deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis that leads to megaloblast formation and megaloblastic and macrocytic anemias. Folic acid is particularly important during phases of rapid cell division, such as infancy, pregnancy, and erythropoiesis, and plays a protective factor in the development of cancer. As humans are unable to synthesize folic acid endogenously, diet and supplementation is necessary to prevent deficiencies. In order to function properly within the body, folic acid must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted by anti-metabolite therapies such as [DB00563] as they function as DHFR inhibitors to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, and therefore prevent the formation of DHF and THF.

Unique among the azoles, miconazole is thought to act through three main mechanisms.[A203636] The primary mechanism of action is through inhibition of the CYP450 14α-lanosterol demethylase enzyme, which results in altered ergosterol production and impaired cell membrane composition and permeability, which in turn leads to cation, phosphate, and low molecular weight protein leakage.[A203636, A203639]



In addition, miconazole inhibits fungal peroxidase and catalase while not affecting NADH oxidase activity, leading to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).[A203636, A203639, A203642] Increased intracellular ROS leads to downstream pleiotropic effects and eventual apoptosis.[A203636]



Lastly, likely as a result of lanosterol demethylation inhibition, miconazole causes a rise in intracellular levels of farnesol. This molecule participates in quorum sensing in _Candida_, preventing the transition from yeast to mycelial forms and thereby the formation of biofilms, which are more resistant to antibiotics.[A203645, A203648] In addition, farnesol is an inhibitor of drug efflux ABC transporters, namely _Candida_ CaCdr1p and CaCdr2p, which may additionally contribute to increased effectiveness of azole drugs.[A203648]', 'Miconazole is an azole antifungal that functions primarily through inhibition of a specific demethylase within the CYP450 complex.[A203636] As miconazole is typically applied topically and is minimally absorbed into the systemic circulation following application, the majority of patient reactions are limited to hypersensitivity and cases of anaphylaxis.[L14021] Patients using intravaginal miconazole products are advised not to rely on contraceptives to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, as well as not to use tampons concurrently.[L14027]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

They work by binding with the phosphate in the food you eat, so that it is eliminated from the body without being absorbed.', 'Patients with advanced renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min) exhibit phosphate retention and some degree of hyperphosphatemia. The retention of phosphate plays a pivotal role in causing secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with osteodystrophy, and soft-tissue calcification. The mechanism by which phosphate retention leads to hyperparathyroidism is not clearly delineated. Therapeutic efforts directed toward the control of hyperphosphatemia include reduction in the dietary intake of phosphate, inhibition of absorption of phosphate in the intestine with phosphate binders, and removal of phosphate from the body by more efficient methods of dialysis. The rate of removal of phosphate by dietary manipulation or by dialysis is insufficient. Dialysis patients absorb 40% to 80% of dietary phosphorus. Therefore, the fraction of dietary phosphate absorbed from the diet needs to be reduced by using phosphate binders in most renal failure patients on maintenance dialysis. Calcium acetate when taken with meals combines with dietary phosphate to form insoluble calcium phosphate which is excreted in the feces. Maintenance of serum phosphorus below 6.0 mg/dl is generally considered as a clinically acceptable outcome of treatment with phosphate binders.

**Off-label** uses include:



1) Secondary prevention of stroke and transient ischemic attacks in patients with rheumatic mitral valve disease but without atrial fibrillation.[A179182]', 'Warfarin is a [vitamin K] antagonist which acts to inhibit the production of vitamin K by vitamin K epoxide reductase.[label,A179221,T116] The reduced form of vitamin K, vitamin KH<sub>2</sub> is a cofactor used in the γ-carboxylation of coagulation factors VII, IX, X, and thrombin. Carboxylation induces a conformational change allowing the factors to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> and to phospholipid surfaces. Uncarboxylated factors VII, IX, X, and thrombin are biologically inactive and therefore serve to interrupt the coagulation cascade. The endogenous anticoagulation proteins C and S also require  γ-carboxylation to function. This is particularly true in the case of thrombin which must be activated in order to form a thrombus. vitamin KH<sub>2</sub> is converted to vitamin K epoxide as part of the γ-carboxylation reaction catalyzed by γ-glutamyl carboxylase. Vitamin K epoxide is then converted to vitamin K<sub>1</sub> by vitamin K epoxide reductase then back to vitamin KH<sub>2</sub> by vitamin K reductase. Warfarin binds to vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 and irreversibly inhibits the enzyme thereby stopping the recycling of vitamin K by preventing the conversion of vitamin K epoxide to vitamin K<sub>1</sub>. This process creates a hypercoagulable state for a short time as proteins C and S degrade first with half lives of 8 and 24 hours, with the exception of factor VII which has a half life of 6 hours.[A179221] Factors IX, X, and finally thrombin degrade later with half lives of 24, 36, and 50 hours resulting in a dominant anticoagulation effect.[A179221] In order to reverse this anticoagulation vitamin K must be supplied, either exogenously or by removal of the vitamin K epoxide reductase inhibition, and time allowed for new coagulation factors to be synthesized.[label,A179221,T116] It takes approximately 2 days for new coagulation factors to be synthesized in the liver. Vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, functionally identical to vitamin K<sub>1</sub>, is synthesized by gut bacteria leading to interactions with antibiotics as elimination of these bacteria can reduce vitamin K<sub>2</sub supply and result in a greater anticoagulation effect.[T116]', 'Warfarin is an anticoagulant, as such it disrupts the coagulation cascade to reduce frequency and extent of thrombus formation.[label,L6616] In patients with deep vein thrombosis or atrial fibrillation there is an increased risk of thrombus formation due to the reduced movement of blood.[T622] For patients with cardiac valve disease or valve replacements this increased coagulability is due to tissue damage. Thrombi due to venous thrombosis can travel to the lungs and become pulmonary emboli, blocking circulation to a portion of lung tissue. Thrombi which form in the heart can travel to the brain and cause ischemic strokes. Prevention of these events is the primary goal of warfarin therapy.



Limitation of thrombus formation is also a source of adverse effects. In patients with atheroscelotic plaques rupture typically results in thrombus formation.[A179212] When these patients are anticoagulated plaque rupture can allow the escape of cholesterol from the lipid core in the form of atheroemboli or cholesterol microemboli. These emboli are smaller than thrombi and block smaller vessels, usually less than 200 μm in diameter. The consequences of this are varied and depend on the location of the blockage. Effects include visual disturbances, acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease, central nervous system ischemia, and purple or blue toe syndrome.[label,A179212] Blue toe syndrome can be reversed if it has not progressed to tissue necrosis but the other effects of microemboli are often permanent.



Antocoagulation appears to mediate warfarin-related nephropathy, a seemingly spontaneous kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease associated with warfarin therapy.[A179215] Nephropathy in this case appears to be due to increased passage of red blood cells through the glomerulus and subsequent blockage of renal tubules with red blood cell casts. This is worsened or possibly triggered by pre-existing kidney damage. Increased risk of warfarin-related nephropathy occurs at INRs over 3.0 but risk does not increase as a function of INR beyond this point.



Warfarin has been linked to the development of calciphylaxis.[label] This is thought to be due to warfarin''s inhibition of [vitamin K](VKA) recycling as VKA is needed for the carboxylation of matrix Gla protein.[A179218] This protein is an anti-calcification factor and its inhibition through preventing the carboxylation step in its production leads to a shift in calcification balance in favor of calciphylaxis. 



Tissue necrosis can occur early on in warfarin therapy.[label] This is attributable to half lives of the clotting factors impacted by inhibition of vitamin K recycling.[label,A179221] Proteins C and S are anticoagulation factors with half lives of 8 and 24 hours respectively. The coagulation factors IX, X, VII, and thrombin (factor II) have half lives of 24, 36, 6, and 50 hours respectively. This means proteins C and S are inactivated sooner than pro-coagulation proteins, with the exception of factor VII, resulting in a pro-thrombotic state for the first few days of therapy. Thrombi which form in this time period can occlude arterioles in various locations, blocking blood flow and causing tissue necrosis due to ischemia.', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

This process creates a hypercoagulable state for a short time as proteins C and S degrade first with half lives of 8 and 24 hours, with the exception of factor VII which has a half life of 6 hours.[A179221] Factors IX, X, and finally thrombin degrade later with half lives of 24, 36, and 50 hours resulting in a dominant anticoagulation effect.[A179221] In order to reverse this anticoagulation vitamin K must be supplied, either exogenously or by removal of the vitamin K epoxide reductase inhibition, and time allowed for new coagulation factors to be synthesized.[label,A179221,T116] It takes approximately 2 days for new coagulation factors to be synthesized in the liver. Vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, functionally identical to vitamin K<sub>1</sub>, is synthesized by gut bacteria leading to interactions with antibiotics as elimination of these bacteria can reduce vitamin K<sub>2</sub supply and result in a greater anticoagulation effect.[T116]', 'Warfarin is an anticoagulant, as such it disrupts the coagulation cascade to reduce frequency and extent of thrombus formation.[label,L6616] In patients with deep vein thrombosis or atrial fibrillation there is an increased risk of thrombus formation due to the reduced movement of blood.[T622] For patients with cardiac valve disease or valve replacements this increased coagulability is due to tissue damage. Thrombi due to venous thrombosis can travel to the lungs and become pulmonary emboli, blocking circulation to a portion of lung tissue. Thrombi which form in the heart can travel to the brain and cause ischemic strokes. Prevention of these events is the primary goal of warfarin therapy.



Limitation of thrombus formation is also a source of adverse effects. In patients with atheroscelotic plaques rupture typically results in thrombus formation.[A179212] When these patients are anticoagulated plaque rupture can allow the escape of cholesterol from the lipid core in the form of atheroemboli or cholesterol microemboli. These emboli are smaller than thrombi and block smaller vessels, usually less than 200 μm in diameter. The consequences of this are varied and depend on the location of the blockage. Effects include visual disturbances, acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease, central nervous system ischemia, and purple or blue toe syndrome.[label,A179212] Blue toe syndrome can be reversed if it has not progressed to tissue necrosis but the other effects of microemboli are often permanent.



Antocoagulation appears to mediate warfarin-related nephropathy, a seemingly spontaneous kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease associated with warfarin therapy.[A179215] Nephropathy in this case appears to be due to increased passage of red blood cells through the glomerulus and subsequent blockage of renal tubules with red blood cell casts. This is worsened or possibly triggered by pre-existing kidney damage. Increased risk of warfarin-related nephropathy occurs at INRs over 3.0 but risk does not increase as a function of INR beyond this point.



Warfarin has been linked to the development of calciphylaxis.[label] This is thought to be due to warfarin''s inhibition of [vitamin K](VKA) recycling as VKA is needed for the carboxylation of matrix Gla protein.[A179218] This protein is an anti-calcification factor and its inhibition through preventing the carboxylation step in its production leads to a shift in calcification balance in favor of calciphylaxis. 



Tissue necrosis can occur early on in warfarin therapy.[label] This is attributable to half lives of the clotting factors impacted by inhibition of vitamin K recycling.[label,A179221] Proteins C and S are anticoagulation factors with half lives of 8 and 24 hours respectively. The coagulation factors IX, X, VII, and thrombin (factor II) have half lives of 24, 36, 6, and 50 hours respectively. This means proteins C and S are inactivated sooner than pro-coagulation proteins, with the exception of factor VII, resulting in a pro-thrombotic state for the first few days of therapy. Thrombi which form in this time period can occlude arterioles in various locations, blocking blood flow and causing tissue necrosis due to ischemia.', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

These folic acid congeners are transported across cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis where they are needed to maintain normal erythropoiesis, synthesize purine and thymidylate nucleic acids, interconvert amino acids, methylate tRNA, and generate and use formate. Using vitamin B12 as a cofactor, folic acid can normalize high homocysteine levels by remethylation of homocysteine to methionine via methionine synthetase.', 'Folic acid is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin found in foods such as liver, kidney, yeast, and leafy, green vegetables. Also known as folate or Vitamin B9, folic acid is an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in DNA and RNA synthesis. More specifically, folic acid is required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. Folic acid is the precursor of tetrahydrofolic acid, which is involved as a cofactor for transformylation reactions in the biosynthesis of purines and thymidylates of nucleic acids. Impairment of thymidylate synthesis in patients with folic acid deficiency is thought to account for the defective deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis that leads to megaloblast formation and megaloblastic and macrocytic anemias. Folic acid is particularly important during phases of rapid cell division, such as infancy, pregnancy, and erythropoiesis, and plays a protective factor in the development of cancer. As humans are unable to synthesize folic acid endogenously, diet and supplementation is necessary to prevent deficiencies. In order to function properly within the body, folic acid must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted by anti-metabolite therapies such as [DB00563] as they function as DHFR inhibitors to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, and therefore prevent the formation of DHF and THF. 



In general, folate serum levels below 5 ng/mL indicate folate deficiency, and levels below 2 ng/mL usually result in megaloblastic anemia.', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

', '**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].



Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].



In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].



There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].



Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].



The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. 



In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].



In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].



The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].', 'Zinc is involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of human proteins may bind zinc, in addition to hundreds of proteins that transport and traffic zinc. It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is an essential element for a proper sense of taste and smell and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations [L2211].



Studies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions [L2095]:



**Colds:** Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently [L2095].



**Wound healing:** Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements [L2095]. 



**Diahrrea**: Oral zinc supplements can reduce the symptoms of diarrhea in children with low levels of zinc, especially in cases of malnutrition [L2095].

Haloperidol is also indicated in the short-term treatment of hyperactive children who show excessive motor activity with accompanying conduct disorders consisting of some or all of the following symptoms: impulsivity, difficulty sustaining attention, aggressivity, mood lability, and poor frustration tolerance. Haloperidol should be reserved for these two groups of children only after failure to respond to psychotherapy or medications other than antipsychotics.[F4645]', 'While haloperidol has demonstrated pharmacologic activity at a number of receptors in the brain, it exerts its antipsychotic effect through its strong antagonism of the dopamine receptor (mainly D2), particularly within the mesolimbic and mesocortical systems of the brain. Schizophrenia is theorized to be caused by a hyperdopaminergic state within the limbic system of the brain.[A34360] Dopamine-antagonizing medications such as haloperidol, therefore, are thought to improve psychotic symptoms by halting this over-production of dopamine. The optimal clinical efficacy of antipsychotics is associated with the blockade of approximately 60 % - 80 % of D2 receptors in the brain.[A34360]



While the exact mechanism is not entirely understood, haloperidol is known to inhibit the effects of dopamine and increase its turnover. Traditional antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, bind more tightly than dopamine itself to the dopamine D2 receptor, with dissociation constants that are lower than that for dopamine.[A4962] It is believed that haloperidol competitively blocks post-synaptic dopamine (D2) receptors in the brain, eliminating dopamine neurotransmission and leading to the relief of delusions and hallucinations that are commonly associated with psychosis. It acts primarily on the D2-receptors and has some effect on 5-HT2 and α1-receptors, with negligible effects on dopamine  D1-receptors. The drug also exerts some blockade of α-adrenergic receptors of the autonomic system.[L2022]



Antagonistic activity regulated through dopamine D2 receptors in the chemoreceptive trigger zone (CTZ) of the brain renders its antiemetic activity. Of the three D2-like receptors, only the D2 receptor is blocked by antipsychotic drugs in direct relation to their clinical antipsychotic abilities. 



Clinical brain-imaging findings show that haloperidol remains tightly bound to D2 dopamine receptors in humans undergoing 2 positron emission tomography (PET) scans with a 24h pause in between scans.[A4962] A common adverse effect of this drug is the development of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), due to this tight binding of haloperidol to the dopamine D2 receptor.



Due to the risk of unpleasant and sometimes lifelong extrapyramidal symptoms, newer antipsychotic medications than haloperidol have been discovered and formulated. Rapid dissociation of drugs from dopamine D2 receptors is a plausible explanation for the improved EPS profile of atypical antipsychotics such as [DB00734]. This is also consistent with the theory of a lower affinity for D2 receptors for these drugs.  As mentioned above, haloperidol binds tightly to the dopamine receptor, potentiating the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms,[A4962] and therefore should only been used when necessary.', 'Use of the first-generation antipsychotics (including haloperidol) is considered highly effective for the management of the "positive" symptoms of schizophrenia including hallucinations, hearing voices, aggression/hostility, disorganized speech, and psychomotor agitation. However, this class is limited by the development of movement disorders such as drug-induced parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, and tardive dyskinesia, and other side effects including sedation, weight gain, and prolactin changes. Compared to the lower-potency first-generation antipsychotics such as [DB00477], [DB01624], [DB00623], and [DB01403], haloperidol typically demonstrates the least amount of side effects within class, but demonstrates a stronger disposition for causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).[A180613, A180616, A180625] Low‐potency medications have a lower affinity for dopamine receptors so that a higher dose is required to effectively treat symptoms of schizophrenia. In addition, they block many receptors other than the primary target (dopamine receptors), such as cholinergic or histaminergic receptors, resulting in a higher incidence of side effects such as sedation, weight gain, and hypotension.



The balance between the wanted drug effects on psychotic symptoms and unwanted side effects are largely at play within dopaminergic brain pathways affected by haloperidol. Cortical dopamine-D2-pathways play an important role in regulating these effects and include the nigrostriatal pathway, which is responsible for causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways, which are responsible for the improvement in positive schizophrenic symptoms, and the tuberoinfundibular dopamine pathway, which is responsible for hyperprolactinemia. 



A syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome.[F4645]



Cases of sudden death, QT-prolongation, and Torsades de Pointes have been reported in patients receiving haloperidol. Higher than recommended doses of any formulation and intravenous administration of haloperidol appear to be associated with a higher risk of QT-prolongation and Torsades de Pointes.

Haloperidol is also indicated in the short-term treatment of hyperactive children who show excessive motor activity with accompanying conduct disorders consisting of some or all of the following symptoms: impulsivity, difficulty sustaining attention, aggressivity, mood lability, and poor frustration tolerance. Haloperidol should be reserved for these two groups of children only after failure to respond to psychotherapy or medications other than antipsychotics.[F4645]', 'While haloperidol has demonstrated pharmacologic activity at a number of receptors in the brain, it exerts its antipsychotic effect through its strong antagonism of the dopamine receptor (mainly D2), particularly within the mesolimbic and mesocortical systems of the brain. Schizophrenia is theorized to be caused by a hyperdopaminergic state within the limbic system of the brain.[A34360] Dopamine-antagonizing medications such as haloperidol, therefore, are thought to improve psychotic symptoms by halting this over-production of dopamine. The optimal clinical efficacy of antipsychotics is associated with the blockade of approximately 60 % - 80 % of D2 receptors in the brain.[A34360]



While the exact mechanism is not entirely understood, haloperidol is known to inhibit the effects of dopamine and increase its turnover. Traditional antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, bind more tightly than dopamine itself to the dopamine D2 receptor, with dissociation constants that are lower than that for dopamine.[A4962] It is believed that haloperidol competitively blocks post-synaptic dopamine (D2) receptors in the brain, eliminating dopamine neurotransmission and leading to the relief of delusions and hallucinations that are commonly associated with psychosis. It acts primarily on the D2-receptors and has some effect on 5-HT2 and α1-receptors, with negligible effects on dopamine  D1-receptors. The drug also exerts some blockade of α-adrenergic receptors of the autonomic system.[L2022]



Antagonistic activity regulated through dopamine D2 receptors in the chemoreceptive trigger zone (CTZ) of the brain renders its antiemetic activity. Of the three D2-like receptors, only the D2 receptor is blocked by antipsychotic drugs in direct relation to their clinical antipsychotic abilities. 



Clinical brain-imaging findings show that haloperidol remains tightly bound to D2 dopamine receptors in humans undergoing 2 positron emission tomography (PET) scans with a 24h pause in between scans.[A4962] A common adverse effect of this drug is the development of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), due to this tight binding of haloperidol to the dopamine D2 receptor.



Due to the risk of unpleasant and sometimes lifelong extrapyramidal symptoms, newer antipsychotic medications than haloperidol have been discovered and formulated. Rapid dissociation of drugs from dopamine D2 receptors is a plausible explanation for the improved EPS profile of atypical antipsychotics such as [DB00734]. This is also consistent with the theory of a lower affinity for D2 receptors for these drugs.  As mentioned above, haloperidol binds tightly to the dopamine receptor, potentiating the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms,[A4962] and therefore should only been used when necessary.', 'Use of the first-generation antipsychotics (including haloperidol) is considered highly effective for the management of the "positive" symptoms of schizophrenia including hallucinations, hearing voices, aggression/hostility, disorganized speech, and psychomotor agitation. However, this class is limited by the development of movement disorders such as drug-induced parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, and tardive dyskinesia, and other side effects including sedation, weight gain, and prolactin changes. Compared to the lower-potency first-generation antipsychotics such as [DB00477], [DB01624], [DB00623], and [DB01403], haloperidol typically demonstrates the least amount of side effects within class, but demonstrates a stronger disposition for causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).[A180613, A180616, A180625] Low‐potency medications have a lower affinity for dopamine receptors so that a higher dose is required to effectively treat symptoms of schizophrenia. In addition, they block many receptors other than the primary target (dopamine receptors), such as cholinergic or histaminergic receptors, resulting in a higher incidence of side effects such as sedation, weight gain, and hypotension.



The balance between the wanted drug effects on psychotic symptoms and unwanted side effects are largely at play within dopaminergic brain pathways affected by haloperidol. Cortical dopamine-D2-pathways play an important role in regulating these effects and include the nigrostriatal pathway, which is responsible for causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways, which are responsible for the improvement in positive schizophrenic symptoms, and the tuberoinfundibular dopamine pathway, which is responsible for hyperprolactinemia. 



A syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome.[F4645]



Cases of sudden death, QT-prolongation, and Torsades de Pointes have been reported in patients receiving haloperidol. Higher than recommended doses of any formulation and intravenous administration of haloperidol appear to be associated with a higher risk of QT-prolongation and Torsades de Pointes. Although cases have been reported even in the absence of predisposing factors, particular caution is advised in treating patients with other QT-prolonging conditions (including electrolyte imbalance [particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia], drugs known to prolong QT, underlying cardiac abnormalities, hypothyroidism, and familial long QT-syndrome).[F4645]



A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status (including catatonic signs) and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure.[F4645]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Upon ingestion, tibolone is quickly converted into three major metabolites: _3 alpha- and 3 beta-hydroxy-tibolone_, which have oestrogenic effects, and the _Delta(4)-isomer_, which has progestogenic and androgenic effects. The specific tissue-selective effects of tibolone occur due to the metabolism, regulation of enzymes and receptor activation that varies in different tissues of the body.

 

The bone-conserving effects occur due to estradiol receptor activation, while the progesterone and androgen receptors are not involved in this process. Breast tissue of monkeys is not found to be stimulated after tibolone administration,  as occurs with estrogen plus progesterone used in combination. This is explained by the fact that tibolone and its metabolites inhibit _sulphatase and 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase_ (HSD) type I and _stimulate sulphotransferase and 17 beta-HSD type II_.  The combined effects of this process prevent the conversion to active estrogens.



In the uterus, the progestogenic activity of the _Delta(4)-metabolite_ and the effect on estrogen-inactivating enzymes prevent estrogenic stimulation. The mammary gland is not stimulated in currently used animal models. Tibolone has been shown to regulate estrogenic activity in several tissue types by influencing the availability of estrogenic compounds for the estradiol receptor in a selective manner [A32164].



Additionally, tibolone modulates cellular homeostasis in the breast by preventing breast tissue proliferation and stimulating cell apoptosis. Tibolone does not stimulate the endometrium because of the action of its highly stable progestogenic metabolite (Delta(4)-isomer) in combination with an effect on the sulfatase (inhibition)-sulfotransferase (stimulation) system. The estrogenic metabolites of tibolone have direct, favorable effects on the cardiovascular system and, in animal models, this drug has shown no adverse consequences. 





The tissue-selective effects of tibolone are the result of metabolism, enzyme regulation and receptor activation that vary in different tissues. The bone-preserving effects of tibolone are the result of estradiol receptor activation, while other steroid receptors, mainly the progesterone and androgen receptors, are not involved in this process. 



In a study of monkeys, breast tissue was not stimulated, which occurs with estrogen and progesterone, because tibolone and its metabolites inhibit _sulfatase and 17 beta-hydroxysteroid _dehydrogenase (HSD) type I and stimulate _sulfotransferase and 17 beta-HSD type II_. The simultaneous effects of this process halt conversion to active estrogens. Additionally, tibolone affects cellular homeostasis in the breast by preventing proliferation and stimulating apoptosis. Tibolone does not stimulate the endometrium due to the action of the highly stable progestogenic metabolite (Delta(4)-isomer) in combination with an effect on the sulphatase (inhibition)-sulphotransferase (stimulation) pathway [A32150].



The levels of tibolone metabolites and the alteration of hormonal activities vary according to the tissue type. In endometrial tissue the _Δ4-isomer_ functions as a progestagen, however, in the brain and liver, it shows androgenic effects. In breast tissue, the primary actions of tibolone are strong inhibition of sulfatase activity and weak inhibition of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity, which leads to blocking the conversion estrone sulfate to E2 [L1720].', 'Tibolone prevents bone loss and treating post-menopausal symptoms without stimulating the endometrial tissues, which may lead to malignancy. Typical, drugs that treat post-menopausal symptoms such as estrogen, have a proliferative effect on the endometrium, increasing the risk of endometrial carcinoma [L1725]. The effects on the bone, brain and vaginal tissues can be explained by the estrogenic activity of tibolone.  It is important to note that activity is not expressed in the endometrium. Tibolone behaves differently from estrogen plus progesterone combinations on the breast. Therefore, tibolone can be characterized as a selective estrogen activity regulator [A32150].



Tibolone has been demonstrated to be an effective agent in treating symptoms associated with menopause. A 16 week trial in 1189 women examined the effect of tibolone 2.5 mg once daily on climacteric symptoms. Women treated with tibolone showed improvement from baseline in typical menopausal symptoms including hot flashes, sweating, insomnia, and anxiety [L1879].', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

', 'Felodipine decreases arterial smooth muscle contractility and subsequent vasoconstriction by inhibiting the influx of calcium ions through voltage-gated L-type calcium channels. It reversibly competes against nitrendipine and other DHP CCBs for DHP binding sites in vascular smooth muscle and cultured rabbit atrial cells. Calcium ions entering the cell through these channels bind to calmodulin. Calcium-bound calmodulin then binds to and activates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Activated MLCK catalyzes the phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain subunit of myosin, a key step in muscle contraction. Signal amplification is achieved by calcium-induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through ryanodine receptors. Inhibition of the initial influx of calcium decreases the contractile activity of arterial smooth muscle cells and results in vasodilation. The vasodilatory effects of felodipine result in an overall decrease in blood pressure. Felodipine may be used to treat mild to moderate essential hypertension.', 'Felodipine belongs to the dihydropyridine (DHP) class of calcium channel blockers (CCBs), the most widely used class of CCBs. There are at least five different types of calcium channels in Homo sapiens: L-, N-, P/Q-, R- and T-type. It was widely accepted that CCBs target L-type calcium channels, the major channel in muscle cells that mediates contraction; however, some studies have shown that felodipine also binds to and inhibits T-type calcium channels. T-type calcium channels are most commonly found on neurons, cells with pacemaker activity and on osteocytes. The pharmacologic significance of T-type calcium channel blockade is unknown. Felodipine also binds to calmodulin and inhibits calmodulin-dependent calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The effect of this interaction appears to be minor.  Another study demonstrated that felodipine attenuates the activity of calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (CaMPDE) by binding to the PDE-1B1 and PDE-1A2 enzyme subunits. CaMPDE is one of the key enzymes involved in cyclic nucleotides and calcium second messenger systems. Felodipine also acts as an antagonist to the mineralcorticoid receptor by competing with aldosterone for binding and blocking aldosterone-induced coactivator recruitment of the mineralcorticoid receptor. Felodipine is able to bind to skeletal and cardiac muscle isoforms of troponin C, one of the key regulatory proteins in muscle contraction. Though felodipine exhibits binding to many endogenous molecules, its vasodilatory effects are still thought to be brought about primarily through inhibition of voltage-gated L-type calcium channels. Similar to other DHP CCBs, felodipine binds directly to inactive calcium channels stabilizing their inactive conformation. Since arterial smooth muscle depolarizations are longer in duration than cardiac muscle depolarizations, inactive channels are more prevalent in smooth muscle cells. Alternative splicing of the alpha-1 subunit of the channel gives felodipine additional arterial selectivity. At therapeutic sub-toxic concentrations, felodipine has little effect on cardiac myocytes and conduction cells.', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Cineol containing preparations of eucalyptus oil may contain up to 80% (or more) 1,8-cineole [A32243] and is one of the most common types of eucalyptus oil formulations used. As an active agent indicated for relieving certain cold symptoms and/or certain muscular sprains and cramps, it is believed that eucalyptus oil may possess some antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities.



Some in vitro studies of human blood monocytes suggest a dose-dependent effect of eucalyptus oil to elicit significant inhibition of multiple cytokines, perhaps in the treatment of airway inflammation [A32244, A32245]. Moreover, other studies in animal models discuss the possibility of eucalyptus oil demonstrating anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects that potentially account for inhibiting the formation of prostaglandins and cytokines by stimulated monocytes in vitro [A32246, A32247].



Furthermore, additional studies have observed eucalyptus oil anti-viral activity against herpes simplex virus (HSV-1, HSV-2) in cell cultures as well as the demonstration of broad antimicrobial activity of eucalyptus medicinal plant extracts against Alicyclobacillus acidoterretris, Bacillus cereus, E. coli, Enterococcus faecalis, MRSA, Propionibacterium acnes, S. aureus, fungus including C. albicans isolates, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and other Gram-positive bacteria.

Capsaicin''s mechanism of action is attributed to "defunctionalization" of nociceptor fibers by inducing a topical hypersensitivity reaction on the skin. This alteration in pain mechanisms is due to many of the following: temporary loss of membrane potential, inability to transport neurotrophic factors leading to altered phenotype, and reversible retraction of epidermal and dermal nerve fiber terminals. ', 'Capsaicin is a TRPV1 receptor agonist. TRPV1 is a trans-membrane receptor-ion channel complex activated by temperatures higher than 43 degrees Celsius, pH lower than 6, and endogenous lipids. When activated by a combination of these factors, the channel can transiently open and initiate depolarization due to the influx of calcium and sodium ions. Because TRPV1 is commonly expressed in A-delta and mostly C fibers, depolarization results in action potentials which send impulses to the brain and spinal cord. These impulses result in capsaicin effects of warming, tingling, itching, stinging, or burning.  Capsaicin also causes more persistent activation of these receptors compared to the environmental agonists, resulting in a loss of response to many sensory stimuli, described as "defunctionalization". Capsaicin is associated with many enzymatic, cytoskeletal, and osmotic changes, as well as disruption of mitochondrial respiration, impairing nociceptor function for extended periods of time.

A deficiency in iron indicates that the body cannot produce enough normal red blood cells.[A32514,L11800] Iron deficiency anemia occurs when body stores of iron decrease to very low levels, and the stored iron is insufficient to support normal red blood cell (RBC) production. Insufficient dietary iron, impaired iron absorption, bleeding, pregnancy, or loss of iron through the urine can lead to iron deficiency.[A32514,L11794]  Symptoms of iron deficiency anemia include fatigue, breathlessness, palpitations, dizziness, and headache.



Taking iron in supplement form, such as ferrous sulfate, allows for more rapid increases in iron levels when dietary supply and stores are not sufficient.[L2175] Iron is transported by the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) across the endolysosomal membrane to enter the macrophage. It can then can be incorporated into ferritin and be stored in the macrophage or carried of the macrophage by ferroportin. This exported iron is  oxidized by the enzyme to ceruloplasmin to Fe3+, followed by sequestration by transferrin for transport in the serum to various sites, including the bone marrow for hemoglobin synthesis or into the liver.[A32524] Iron combines with porphyrin and globin chains to form hemoglobin, which is critical for oxygen delivery from the lungs to other tissues.[L2263]', 'Ferrous sulfate replenishes iron, an essential component in hemoglobin, myoglobin, and various enzymes. It replaces the iron that is usually found in hemoglobin and myoglobin.

Conversely, vitamin D deficiency can often occur from a combination of insufficient exposure to sunlight, inadequate dietary intake of vitamin D, genetic defects with endogenous vitamin D receptor, or even severe liver or kidney disease [A243]. Such deficiency is known for resulting in conditions like rickets or osteomalacia, all of which reflect inadequate mineralization of bone, enhanced compensatory skeletal demineralization, resultant decreased calcium ion blood concentrations, and increases in the production and secretion of parathyroid hormone [A223]. Increases in parathyroid hormone stimulates the mobilization of skeletal calcium and the renal excretion of phosphorus [A223]. This enhanced mobilization of skeletal calcium leads towards porotic bone conditions [A223].



Ordinarily, while vitamin D3 is made naturally via photochemical processes in the skin, both itself and vitamin D2 can be found in various food and pharmaceutical sources as dietary supplements. The principal biological function of vitamin D is the maintenance of normal levels of serum calcium and phosphorus in the bloodstream by enhancing the efficacy of the small intestine to absorb these minerals from the diet [A223]. At the liver, vitamin D3 or D2 is hydroxylated to 25-hydroxyvitamin D and then finally to the primary active metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in the kidney via further hydroxylation [A223, A243]. This final metabolite binds to endogenous vitamin d receptors, which results in a variety of regulatory roles - including maintaining  calcium balance, the regulation of parathyroid hormone, the promotion of the renal reabsorption of calcium, increased intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus, and increased calcium and phosphorus mobilization of calcium and phosphorus from bone to plasma to maintain balanced levels of each in bone and the plasma [A223, A243].', 'The in vivo synthesis of the predominant two biologically active metabolites of vitamin D occurs in two steps. The first hydroxylation of vitamin D3 or D2 occurs in the liver to yield 25-hydroxyvitamin D while the second hydroxylation happens in the kidneys to give 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D [FDA Label]. These vitamin D metabolites subsequently facilitate the active absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the small intestine, serving to increase serum calcium and phosphate levels sufficiently to allow bone mineralization [FDA Label]. Conversely, these vitamin D metabolites also assist in mobilizing calcium and phosphate from bone and likely increase the reabsorption of calcium and perhaps also of phosphate via the renal tubules [FDA Label]. There exists a period of 10 to 24 hours between the administration of vitamin D and the initiation of its action in the body due to the necessity of synthesis of the active vitamin D metabolites in the liver and kidneys [FDA Label]. It is parathyroid hormone that is responsible for the regulation of such metabolism at the level of the kidneys [FDA Label].', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Over time, this common use in children growing up may have conferred upon cod liver oil its identity as a healthy and useful all-purpose dietary supplement.

Regardless, because it does contain a combination of a number of important and healthy nutritional compounds, cod liver oil has sometimes been recommended in the literature for conferring the health effects of some of these compounds, such as the potential use of cod liver oil supplements in post-heart attack patients for secondary prophylaxis associated with the use of omega-3 fatty acids [A33165].', 'As cod liver oil consists of the component compounds of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), vitamin A, and vitamin D [A33159, L2872, L2871] further information about the mechanisms of action of these cod liver oil components can be found by searching for fish oil, vitamin A, and vitamin D on DrugBank.', 'As cod liver oil is a composite of several other nutritional compounds including the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as well as vitamin A and vitamin D [A33159, L2872, L2871], the presence in varying amounts of all of these compounds at once makes it difficult to recommend or use cod liver oil as an appropriate supplement to confer any one particular health effect or for any one particular nutritional deficiency.



For example, one tablespoon of cod liver oil contains approximately 4,080 ug of retinol (vitamin A) and 34 ug (1,360 IU) of vitamin D [L2871]. Since the general dietary reference intake of vitamin A is only 900 ug per day for adult men, 700 ug per day for women, and 3000 ug per day as the tolerable upper intake level, the regular intake of cod liver oil as a regular supplement can result in harmful levels of vitamin A accumulating in the liver and sufficient to cause hypervitaminosis A [A33163], which is associated with various symptoms such as blurred vision, changes in consciousness, skin and hair changes, liver damage, among many others.



Moreover, while cod liver oil only contains a certain percentage of the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA per amount of the oil [L2871], separate fish oils supplement products that exclusively consist of only EPA and DHA are available in a great variety of different percentage content formulations, even including prescription strength formulations should certain patients need such a level of therapy. Furthermore, such exclusive omega-3 fatty acid supplement products do not contain any vitamin A or D either, which allows patients to use the supplements without any concern about affecting their vitamin A or D levels or exposing themselves to the unnecessary excess intake of vitamins.



Subsequently, although cod liver oil contains a combination of healthy dietary supplements like EPA, DHA, vitamin A, and vitamin D, the presence in varying amounts of all of these compounds all at once makes it difficult to effectively titrate for appropriate amounts of intake for all the compounds involved when using cod liver oil as a general supplement, often resulting in either an excess or insufficient amount of one or more the aforementioned compounds.



Nevertheless, because cod liver oil does consist of the component compounds of EPA, DHA, vitamin A, and vitamin D, further information about the pharmacodynamics of these cod liver oil components can be found by searching for fish oil, vitamin A, and vitamin D on DrugBank.', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

It is often used in combination with [misoprostol] as a gastro-protective agent in patients with high risk of developing NSAID-induced ulcers.', 'Diclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 and -2, the enzymes responsible for production of prostaglandin (PG) G<sub>2</sub> which is the precursor to other PGs.[label,T116] These molecules have broad activity in pain and inflammation and the inhibition of their production is the common mechanism linking each effect of diclofenac.



PGE<sub>2</sub> is the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.[A179023] It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.[T116,A179023] PGE<sub>2</sub> activates the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled EP<sub>1</sub> receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE<sub>2</sub> also activates the EP<sub>4</sub> receptor, coupled to G<sub>s</sub>, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE<sub>2</sub> act via EP<sub>3</sub> to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP<sub>2</sub> to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI<sub>2</sub> is known to play a role via its G<sub>s</sub>-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.



PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP<sub>2</sub> receptors.[T116,A179044] Similarly to β adrenergic receptors these are G<sub>s</sub>-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE<sub>2</sub> also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.[T116] PGD<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP<sub>1</sub> receptor.[A179044] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.



PGE<sub>2</sub> can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory G<sub>q</sub> EP<sub>3</sub> receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.[T116] This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever. NSAIDs prevent the generation of PGE<sub>2</sub> thereby reducing the activity of these neurons.

Acne is a multifactorial condition, and evidence exists to support multiple mechanisms of action for adapalene. Adapalene binds to retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-beta and RAR-gamma; this complex subsequently binds to one of three retinoid X receptors (RXRs), which as a complex is capable of binding DNA to modulate transcriptional activity.[A193509] Although the full extent of transcriptional modulation is not described, retinoid activation is generally known to affect cellular proliferation and differentiation[A193527], and adapalene has been shown to inhibit HeLa cell proliferation and human keratinocyte differentiation.[A193515] These effects primarily account for adapalene''s comedolytic and anticomedogenic properties.



In addition, adapalene modulates the immune response by down-regulating toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2) expression and inhibiting the transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP-1). TLR-2 recognizes _Cutibacterium acnes_ (formerly _Propionibacterium acnes_), the bacterium primarily associated with acne. TLR-2 activation causes nuclear translocation of AP-1 and downstream pro-inflammatory gene regulation. Therefore, adapalene has a general anti-inflammatory effect, which reduces inflammation-mediated acne symptoms.[A193512]

Ribavirin triphosphate (RTP) is the predominant metabolite which directly inhibits viral mRNA polymerase by binding to the nucleotide binding site of the enzyme. This prevents the binding of the correct nucleotides, leading to a reduction in viral replication or to the production of defective virions [A19645]. RTP also demonstrates an inhibitory action on viral mRNA guanylyltransferase and mRNA 2′-O-methyltransferase of dengue virus. Inhibition of these enzymes disrupts the posttranslational capping of the 5′ end of viral mRNA through ribavirin being incorporated at the 5′ end in place of guanosine and preventing the cap methylation step. 



Inhibition of host inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and subsequent depletion of GTP pool is proposed to be another mechanism of action of ribavirin. IMPDH catalyzes the rate-limiting step where inosine 5′-monophosphate is converted to xanthine monophosphate during guanosine monophosphate (GMP) synthesis. GMP is later converted to guanosine triphoshpate (GTP). Ribavirin monophosphate mimics inosine 5′-monophosphate and acts as a competitive inhibitor of IMPDH. Inhibited de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides and decreased intracellular GTP pools leads to a decline in viral protein synthesis and limit replication of viral genomes [A19645].



Ribavirin acts as a mutagen in the target virus to cause an ''error catastrophe'' due to increased viral mutations.

Over-expressed in breast tumour cells, HER-2 overamplifies the signal provided by other receptors of the HER family by forming heterodimers [A121]. The HER-2 receptor is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that consists of an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane region, and an intracellular or cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. It is activated by the formation of homodimers or heterodimers with other EGFR proteins, leading to dimerization and autophosphorylation and/or transphosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in EGFR intracellular domains [A121].

Due to upregulation of HER-2 in tumour cells, hyperactivation of these signaling pathways and abnormal cell proliferation is observed. Trastuzumab binds to the extracellular ligand-binding domain and blocks the cleavage of the extracellular domain of HER-2 to induce its antibody-induced receptor downmodulation [A121], and subsequently inhibits HER-2-mediated intracellular signaling cascades. Inhibition of MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways lead to an increase in cell cycle arrest, and the suppression of cell growth and proliferation [A121].

', '**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].



Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].



In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].



There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].



Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].



The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. 



In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].



In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].



The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].', 'Zinc is involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of human proteins may bind zinc, in addition to hundreds of proteins that transport and traffic zinc. It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is an essential element for a proper sense of taste and smell and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations [L2211].



Studies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions [L2095]:



**Colds:** Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently [L2095].



**Wound healing:** Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements [L2095]. 



**Diahrrea**: Oral zinc supplements can reduce the symptoms of diarrhea in children with low levels of zinc, especially in cases of malnutrition [L2095].
