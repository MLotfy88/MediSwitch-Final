Since beta-blockers may inhibit some of the normal physiologic response to hypoglycemia, glucoregulatory mechanisms (in the absence of food) may be compromised. Specifically, inhibition of catecholamine-mediated glycogenolysis and glucose mobilization in association with beta-blockade can potentiate the hypoglycemia and delay recovery of normal blood glucose levels. In addition, symptoms of hypoglycemia such as tremors and tachycardia may be absent, making it more difficult for patients to recognize an oncoming episode.
