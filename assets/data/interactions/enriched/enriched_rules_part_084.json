Some investigators believe that antimicrobials interfere with the enterohepatic recirculation of estrogens by decreasing bacterial hydrolytic enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract that are responsible for regenerating parent estrogen molecules following first-pass metabolism.

Most antimicrobials, with the exception of the rifamycins and possibly griseofulvin, do not induce hepatic enzymes and have not been shown to significantly increase the clearance of oral contraceptive estrogens. Some investigators believe that antimicrobials interfere with the enterohepatic recirculation of estrogens by decreasing bacterial hydrolytic enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract that are responsible for regenerating parent estrogen molecules following first-pass metabolism. It is possible that a small number of women may be more susceptible to contraceptive failure and, consequently, are more sensitive to the effects of antimicrobials on estrogen disposition in vivo, but risk factors or genetic predispositions have yet to be identified.",

The mechanism involves peripheral vasodilation secondary to enhanced levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in vascular smooth muscle cells, as PDE inhibitors prevent degradation of cGMP while riociguat promotes its synthesis by stimulating soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), an enzyme in the cardiopulmonary system that binds with nitric oxide (NO) to catalyze the synthesis of cGMP. Riociguat does not affect the pharmacokinetics of sildenafil.",
      "management_text": "Concomitant use of riociguat with PDE inhibitors, including specific PDE-5 inhibitors (e.g., avanafil, sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil) or nonspecific PDE inhibitors (e.g., dipyridamole, theophylline), is considered contraindicated. Riociguat should be discontinued at least 24 hours before administering a PDE-5 inhibitor, and avoidance of riociguat administration within 24 hours after sildenafil or within 48 hours after tadalafil is recommended. Limited data exists for other PDE inhibitors.",
