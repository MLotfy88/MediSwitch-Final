    "clinical_significance": "MMS is an effective and safe treatment for skin cancers, particularly those with a high risk of recurrence or located in cosmetically and functionally sensitive areas. By meticulously removing cancerous tissue while preserving as much healthy tissue as possible, MMS achieves superior cure rates and minimizes the need for more extensive surgeries. Comprehensive perioperative care is emphasized, as these are crucial for optimizing patient outcomes and reducing the risk of complications.\n\nRecent developments in MMS have expanded its use in the treatment of melanoma, a significant evolution in dermatologic oncology.\n[3]\nAdvances in rapid protocols for melanocyte-specific immunohistochemical staining on frozen section specimens have enabled more accurate identification and removal of melanoma cells during surgery.\n[3]\nIncreasing evidence supports MMS as noninferior or superior to wide local excision, particularly for melanoma in situ and lentigo maligna on special sites like the face.\n[3]\nThe American Academy of Dermatology has recognized the appropriateness of MMS for treating these conditions in its most recent guidelines, which makes the factors surrounding the MMS procedure of utmost importance in these patients.\n[3]\n\nIntegrating multidisciplinary management, particularly for complex cases, ensures that patients receive well-rounded care that addresses all aspects of their condition. The involvement of nursing, allied health professionals, and interprofessional teams is crucial for enhancing patient-centered care, ensuring safety, and improving team performance. Their roles in monitoring, wound care, and patient education are vital in achieving successful outcomes and minimizing adverse events.\n\nEthical considerations, patient education, and the psychosocial impact of MMS are also critical components of a holistic approach to patient care. This course highlights the significance of these factors in providing a comprehensive treatment experience. Additionally, the discussion on new developments and technological advancements provides insight into the future direction of MMS. At the same time, the focus on environmental sustainability reflects a growing awareness of healthcare's broader impact. In summary, MMS continues to set the standard for excellence in dermatologic surgery. Through careful consideration of all aspects of care, from initial evaluation to long-term outcomes and the integration of new advancements, MMS remains a patient-centered, multidisciplinary approach to treating skin cancer that is both effective and forward-looking.",
    "monitoring": "Monitoring during and after MMS is vital to patient care, requiring coordinated efforts from the entire interprofessional team. Nurses and medical assistants are key in assessing patient status and anxiety, monitoring vital signs, pain levels, and wound healing, and promptly addressing complications like bleeding, infection, or dehiscence.\n[18]\nAllied health professionals assist in intraoperative monitoring, helping manage issues such as excessive bleeding or equipment malfunctions. Postoperatively, nurses and medical assistants ensure adherence to care instructions and monitor wound healing, while pharmacists and/or primary care clinicians oversee medication management, adjusting anticoagulation and antibiotic regimens as needed.\n[14]\nThis collaborative monitoring ensures a smooth surgical experience and successful recovery for patients undergoing MMS.\n[10]"
