    "indications": "Patients with a history of past protamine exposure, vasectomy, fish allergies, and insulin-controlled diabetes are at increased risk of an adverse reaction.\n[16]\n[3]\n[17]\n[18]\nThe patients most common patients at risk for a protamine reaction were on NPH insulin in the past. There are approximately 2.8 milligrams of protamine per 100 units of protamine zinc insulin and 0.5 milligrams of protamine per 100 units of isophane (NPH) insulin. Presumably, chronic exposure to low doses of protamine in a patient on these insulin preparations can cause the formation of antibodies to protamine.",
    "mechanism": "Unfractionated heparin is a strongly anionic anticoagulant that forms a salt aggregate when exposed to the positive cationic arginine peptide of protamine.\n[6]\nThe salt aggregate that forms is inactive and has no anticoagulant properties. Protamine has a rapid onset of action, neutralizes unfractionated heparin within 5 minutes, and has a relatively short half-life of approximately 10 minutes. There is very little known about the metabolism of the heparin-protamine salt aggregate. Some studies have described the metabolism of the salt in the liver, while other studies have reported that the salt is metabolized and excreted by the kidneys.\n[7]\n[8]\nCare is necessary to administer the proper dose of protamine, as excessive doses, protamine has been shown to possess anticoagulation properties and may cause bleeding and increased transfusion requirements.\n[3]\n[9]",
    "administration": "In the cardiac operating room setting, protamine is typically administered intravenously as an infusion over 10 to 15 minutes; this slow infusion is intended to decrease the likelihood of side effects that can occur if infused too rapidly. Many anesthesiologists in the cardiac operating room setting will administer a small bolus of protamine, often called a \"test dose,\" to allow for early detection of adverse reactions, including hemodynamic instability. Often, protamine is administered through a peripheral intravenous line rather than a central line, as studies have shown that protamine delivered through a central line can cause an increase in plasma histamine levels and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance.\n[10]\nIf no adverse reaction occurs, then the balance of the protamine dose is infused. Proper dosing of protamine to reverse heparin is controversial and varies in the medical literature.\n[3]\n\nProtamine is packaged as an intravenous solution in a concentration of 10 milligrams/milliliter. To neutralize heparin, 1 to 1.5 mg of protamine gets injected per 100 units of heparin. Initial protamine treatment for dalteparin, tinzaparin, or enoxaparin overdosage is 1 mg protamine per 100 units of the low molecular weight heparin given. Follow-up doses of protamine in the 0.5 mg range per 100 units can be given if bleeding continues 4 hours later. The efficacy of protamine reversing heparin can be assessed by measuring the activated clotting time or performing a thromboelastogram test. In clinical trials, hemodynamic changes and arterial oxygenation changes decreased with protamine infusion via the ascending aorta vs. a central venous line suggesting this may be the preferred route of administration.\n[11]",
    "adverse_effects": "The most common adverse effect associated with protamine administration includes an anaphylactic response consisting of systemic hypotension, pulmonary vasoconstriction, allergic reactions, pulmonary hypertension, bronchoconstriction, and bradycardia. The incidence of anaphylactic reactions ranges from 0.06% to 10.6%.\n[9]\nThere are also reports of liver and kidney tissue damage.\n[6]\nSuspected anaphylactic responses to protamine receive treatment in the same way, other perioperative anaphylactic reactions. Therapies include the use of albuterol, methylprednisolone, H1, and H2 antihistamines, vasopressin, norepinephrine, fluid administration, glucagon, and echocardiography to monitor cardiac function.\n\nExcess protamine can also negatively impact platelet function, interfere with coagulation factors, and stimulate the breakdown of the clot.\n[3]\nThe thinking is that protamine may potentiate fibrinolysis by decreasing thrombin concentrations.\n[3]\n\nPulmonary hypertension is a potentially catastrophic adverse response to protamine administration; it is believed to be due to thromboxane A2 release. This release of thromboxane has been shown in studies to increase pulmonary vascular resistance by up to 10 times.\n[12]\n[13]\nThis condition can have treatment with the use of a prostacyclin EI infusion. Some studies have suggested the protamine-induced pulmonary hypertension is preventable by continuing aspirin intake before surgery, as aspirin suppresses the production of thromboxanes through its irreversible inactivation of the cyclooxygenase enzyme.\n\nHypotension from protamine infusion is thought to be due to intracellular calcium release and nitric oxide release.\n[14]\n[15]\nPrevention options include antihistamines to suppress an allergic response and steroids to reduce any inflammatory response.\n[5]\nVasopressors are often used to counteract protamine-induced hypotension.",
    "monitoring": "Protamine should be given slowly, and patients should be monitored closely for anaphylaxis, rapid hypotension, or an increase in pulmonary artery pressures.  Anaphylaxis can cause an increase in peak airway pressures along with hypotension, a rash, and wheezing, or difficulty breathing. The presence of an arterial line for invasive blood pressure monitoring and/or a pulmonary artery catheter to monitor changes in pulmonary artery pressures is advantageous to recognize early negative sequelae from protamine administration. It is also imperative for the medical staff to have access to cardiovascular rescue drugs (vasoactive/inotropic drugs) and resuscitation equipment should an adverse reaction occur.",
    "toxicity": "Protamine’s toxicity is thought to be due to its positive charge. It has been shown to cause a decrease in endothelial cell ATP production and progressive mitochondrial injury in bovine pulmonary endothelial cells.\n[19]\nProtamine also has a toxic effect on myocardial cells, postulated to be due to its positive charge affecting mitochondrial cells intracellularly.\n[20]\nThe theory is that the salt formed between protamine and heparin that effectively neutralizes the positively charged molecule of protamine offers some intracellular protection against toxicity."
