NSAIDs should be used with caution in patients with history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding, as these patients had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors.  Caution is also advised if NSAIDs are prescribed to patients with other factors that increase risk of GI bleeding, such as:  prolonged NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), anticoagulants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; alcohol use; smoking; history of gastrointestinal surgery or anastomosis, older age; poor general health status; and advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy.
