    "clinical_significance": "The value of medical simulation has been well demonstrated in its relation to improved medical knowledge, performance, and comfort level with procedures.\n[9]\nA key component to successful simulation-based education is competent faculty.\n[10]\nSimulation educators and medical teachers come from different educational backgrounds with different career paths.\n[11]\n\nOpportunities for professional development and continuing education are essential for simulation educators, especially with such variable career starting points. Also, the field of medical simulation is continually evolving as new technologies and modalities are developed. This variability highlights the need for educators to seek out professional development opportunities that will serve to advance their current understanding to stay up-to-date with best practices in simulation."
