      "text": "Expanding intracranial hematoma is rapidly fatal and requires early therapeutic intervention. Morbidity/mortality significantly increases if treatment delayed more than 1.9 hours.\n[1]\nOther studies have indicated poor prognosis if treatment delayed beyond 70 minutes.\n[2]\nThis procedure is rarely performed by emergency physicians, and every effort should be made to discuss the patient and plan for procedure with a neurosurgeon prior to intervention.",
