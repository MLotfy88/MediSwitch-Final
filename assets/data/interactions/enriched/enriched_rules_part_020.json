Certain systemic reactions stemming from parenteral iron therapy are thought to be mediated by inflammatory substances such as bradykinin in response to iron-catalyzed generation of toxic free radicals. Since ACE inhibitors decrease the breakdown of kinins, it is conceivable that they may potentiate these reactions. Anaphylactic-type reactions, including fatalities, have followed the parenteral administration of iron dextran. Such reactions occur most often within the first several minutes of administration and are generally characterized by sudden onset of respiratory difficulty and/or cardiovascular collapse. The extent of risk for anaphylactic-type reactions following exposure to any specific iron dextran product is unknown, but may vary among the products due to differences in chemical characteristics.",
      "management_text": "Patients should be closely monitored during and after parenteral administration of iron dextran, regardless of whether they are being treated with an ACE inhibitor. This is particularly important in patients with a history of drug allergy or multiple drug allergies or an immune/inflammatory condition such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis. Resuscitation techniques and personnel trained in the detection and treatment of anaphylactic-type reactions should be readily available. Prior to the first therapeutic dose, a test dose corresponding to 25 mg iron should be injected gradually. Although anaphylactic reactions are usually evident within a few minutes, observe patients for at least one hour before administering the remainder of the therapeutic dose. Administration must be stopped immediately if signs of an anaphylactoid reaction are observed. Patients should also be closely monitored during each subsequent administration of iron dextran. Fatal reactions have occurred following the test dose and also in situations where the test dose was tolerated.

      "effect": "Although they are frequently combined in clinical practice, diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may have additive effects. Coadministration makes hypotension and hypovolemia more likely than does either drug alone. Some ACE inhibitors may attenuate the increase in the urinary excretion of sodium caused by some loop diuretics. Some patients on diuretics, especially those on dialysis or a dietary salt restriction, may experience acute hypotension with lightheadedness and dizziness after receiving the first dose of the ACE inhibitor. In addition, ACE inhibitors may cause renal insufficiency or acute renal failure in patients with sodium depletion or renal artery stenosis.",
      "management_text": "Monitoring of blood pressure, diuresis, electrolytes, and renal function is recommended during coadministration. The possibility of first-dose hypotensive effects may be minimized by initiating therapy with small doses of the ACE inhibitor, or either discontinuing the diuretic temporarily or increasing the salt intake approximately one week prior to initiating an ACE inhibitor. Alternatively, the patient may remain under medical supervision for at least two hours after the first dose of the ACE inhibitor, or until blood pressure has stabilized.",

      "effect": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may attenuate the antihypertensive effects of ACE inhibitors. The proposed mechanism is NSAID-induced inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis, which results in unopposed pressor activity producing hypertension. In addition, NSAIDs can cause fluid retention, which also affects blood pressure. Concomitant use of NSAIDs and ACE inhibitors may also cause deterioration in renal function, particularly in patients who are elderly or volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy) or have compromised renal function. Acute renal failure may occur, although effects are usually reversible. Chronic use of NSAIDs alone may be associated with renal toxicities, including elevations in serum creatinine and BUN, tubular necrosis, glomerulitis, renal papillary necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and renal failure.",
      "management_text": "Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who require prolonged (greater than 1 week) concomitant therapy with an NSAID should have blood pressure monitored more closely following initiation, discontinuation, or change of dosage of the NSAID. Renal function should also be evaluated periodically during prolonged coadministration. The interaction is not expected to occur with low doses (e.g., low-dose aspirin) or intermittent short-term administration of NSAIDs.",
