May increase the dose at intervals of 24 hours or greater, in increments of 1 mg per day to 2 mg per day, as tolerated, to a recommended dose of 4 mg per day to 8 mg per day.. Efficacy has been demonstrated in a range of 4 mg per day to 16 mg per day.. However, doses above 6 mg per day for twice daily dosing were not demonstrated to be more efficacious than lower doses, were associated with more extrapyramidal symptoms and other adverse effects, and are generally not recommended.. In a single study supporting once-daily dosing, the efficacy results were generally stronger for 8 mg than for 4 mg.. The safety of doses above 16 mg per day has not been evaluated in clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] .. Adolescents The initial dose is 0.5 mg once daily, administered as a single-daily dose in the morning or evening.. The dose may be adjusted at intervals of 24 hours or greater, in increments of 0.5 mg per day or 1 mg per day, as tolerated, to a recommended dose of 3 mg per day.. Although efficacy has been demonstrated in studies of adolescent patients with schizophrenia at doses between 1 mg per day to 6 mg per day, no additional benefit was observed above 3 mg per day, and higher doses were associated with more adverse events.. Doses higher than 6 mg per day have not been studied.. Patients experiencing persistent somnolence may benefit from administering half the daily dose twice daily.. Maintenance Therapy While it is unknown how long a patient with schizophrenia should remain on risperidone oral solution, the effectiveness of risperidone oral solution, 2 mg per day to 8 mg per day at delaying relapse was demonstrated in a controlled trial in adult patients who had been clinically stable for at least 4 weeks and were then followed for a period of 1 to 2 years [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] .. 2.2 Bipolar Mania Usual Dose Adults The initial dose range is 2 mg per day to 3 mg per day..

The effective dose range is 1 mg per day to 6 mg per day, as studied in the short-term, placebo-controlled trials.. In these trials, short-term (3 week) anti-manic efficacy was demonstrated in a flexible dosage range of 1 mg per day to 6 mg per day [see Clinical Studies (14.2, 14.3) ] .. Risperidone oral solution, doses higher than 6 mg per day were not studied.. Pediatrics The initial dose is 0.5 mg once daily, administered as a single-daily dose in the morning or evening.. The dose may be adjusted at intervals of 24 hours or greater, in increments of 0.5 mg or 1 mg per day, as tolerated, to the recommended target dose of 1 mg per day to 2.5 mg per day.. Although efficacy has been demonstrated in studies of pediatric patients with bipolar mania at doses between 0.5 mg and 6 mg per day, no additional benefit was observed above 2.5 mg per day, and higher doses were associated with more adverse events.. The total daily dose of risperidone oral solution can be administered once daily, or half the total daily dose can be administered twice daily.. For patients with body weight less than 20 kg, initiate dosing at 0.25 mg per day.. For patients with body weight greater than or equal to 20 kg, initiate dosing at 0.5 mg per day.. After a minimum of four days, the dose may be increased to the recommended dose of 0.5 mg per day for patients less than 20 kg and 1 mg per day for patients greater than or equal to 20 kg.. In patients not achieving sufficient clinical response, the dose may be increased at intervals of 2 weeks or greater, in increments of 0.25 mg per day for patients less than 20 kg, or increments of 0.5 mg per day for patients greater than or equal to 20 kg.. The effective dose range is 0.5 mg per day to 3 mg per day..

The dose may be increased in increments of 0.5 mg or less, administered twice daily.. For doses above 1.5 mg twice daily, increase in intervals of one week or greater [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 and 8.7) ] .. 2.5 Dose Adjustments for Specific Drug Interactions When risperidone oral solution is co-administered with enzyme inducers (e.g., carbamazepine), the dose of risperidone oral solution should be increased up to double the patient’s usual dose.. When fluoxetine or paroxetine is co-administered with risperidone oral solution, the dose of risperidone oral solution should be reduced.. The risperidone oral solution dose should not exceed 8 mg per day in adults when co-administered with these drugs.. 2.6 Administration of Risperidone Oral Solution Risperidone oral solution can be administered directly from the oral dosing syringe, or can be mixed with a beverage prior to administration.",,,,,,Oral

If flumazenil injection is drawn into a syringe or mixed with any of these solutions, it should be discarded after 24 hours.. For optimum sterility, flumazenil injection should remain in the vial until just before use.. As with all parenteral drug products, flumazenil injection should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.. To minimize the likelihood of pain at the injection site, flumazenil injection should be administered through a freely running intravenous infusion into a large vein.. Reversal of Conscious Sedation Adult Patients For the reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines administered for conscious sedation, the recommended initial dose of flumazenil injection is 0.2 mg (2 mL) administered intravenously over 15 seconds.. If the desired level of consciousness is not obtained after waiting an additional 45 seconds, a second dose of 0.2 mg (2 mL) can be injected and repeated at 60-second intervals where necessary (up to a maximum of 4 additional times) to a maximum total dose of 1 mg (10 mL).. The dosage should be individualized based on the patient’s response, with most patients responding to doses of 0.6 mg to 1 mg (see INDIVIDUALIZATION OF DOSAGE ).. In the event of resedation, repeated doses may be administered at 20-minute intervals as needed.. For repeat treatment, no more than 1 mg (given as 0.2 mg/min) should be administered at any one time, and no more than 3 mg should be given in any one hour.. It is recommended that flumazenil injection be administered as the series of small injections described (not as a single bolus injection) to allow the practitioner to control the reversal of sedation to the approximate endpoint desired and to minimize the possibility of adverse effects (see INDIVIDUALIZATION OF DOSAGE ).. Pediatric Patients For the reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines administered for conscious sedation in pediatric patients greater than 1 year of age, the recommended initial dose is 0.01 mg/kg (up to 0.2 mg) administered intravenously over 15 seconds.. If the desired level of consciousness is not obtained after waiting an additional 45 seconds, further injections of 0.01 mg/kg (up to 0.2 mg) can be administered and repeated at 60-second intervals where necessary (up to a maximum of 4 additional times) to a maximum total dose of 0.05 mg/kg or 1 mg , whichever is lower.. The mean total dose administered in the pediatric clinical trial o f flumazenil was 0.65 mg (range: 0.08 mg to 1.00 mg).. Approximately one-half of patients required the maximum of five injections.. Resedation occurred in 7 of 60 pediatric patients who were fully alert 10 minutes after the start of flumazenil injection administration (see PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use ).. The safety and efficacy of flumazenil injection in the reversal of conscious sedation in pediatric patients below the age of 1 year have not been established.. Reversal of General Anesthesia in Adult Patients For the reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines administered for general anesthesia, the recommended initial dose of flumazenil injection is 0.2 mg (2 mL) administered intravenously over 15 seconds.. If the desired level of consciousness is not obtained after waiting an additional 45 seconds, a further dose of 0.2 mg (2 mL) can be injected and repeated at 60-second intervals where necessary (up to a maximum of 4 additional times) to a maximum total dose of 1 mg (10 mL).. Management of Suspected Benzodiazepine Overdose in Adult Patients For initial management of a known or suspected benzodiazepine overdose, the recommended initial dose of flumazenil injection is 0.2 mg (2 mL) administered intravenously over 30 seconds.. If the desired level of consciousness is not obtained after waiting 30 seconds, a further dose of 0.3 mg (3 mL) can be administered over another 30 seconds.. Further doses of 0.5 mg (5 mL) can be administered over 30 seconds at 1 -minute intervals up to a cumulative dose of 3 mg.. Do not rush the administration of flumazenil injection.. Most patients with a benzodiazepine overdose will respond to a cumulative dose of 1 mg to 3 mg of flumazenil injection, and doses beyond 3 mg do not reliably produce additional effects.. On rare occasions, patients with a partial response at 3 mg may require additional titration up to a total dose of 5 mg (administered slowly in the same manner).. If a patient has not responded 5 minutes after receiving a cumulative dose of 5 mg of flumazenil injection, the major cause of sedation is likely no t to be due to benzodiazepines, and additional flumazenil injection is likely to have no effect.. In the event of resedation, repeated doses may be given at 20-minute intervals if needed.. For repeat treatment, no more than 1 mg (given as 0.5 mg/min) should be given at any one time and no more than 3 mg should be given in any one hour.. Safety and Handling Flumazenil injection is supplied in sealed dosage forms and poses no known risk to the healthcare provider..

In situations of less severity, lower doses will generally suffice, while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required.... Usually the parenteral dosage ranges are one-third to one-half the oral dose given every 12 hours.... However, in certain overwhelming, acute, life-threatening situations, administration of dosages exceeding the usual dosages may be justified and may be in multiples of the oral dosages.... Reported regimens range from 1 to 6 mg/kg of body weight as a single intravenous injection to 40 mg initially followed by repeat intravenous injection every 2 to 6 hours while shock persists.... For the treatment of cerebral edema in adults an initial intravenous dose of 10 mg is recommended followed by 4 mg intramuscularly every six hours until maximum response has been noted.... Oral dexamethasone, 1 to 3 mg t.i.d., should be given as soon as possible and dosage tapered off over a period of five to seven days.... This may approximate 0.2 mg/kg/24 hours in divided doses.... In treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day or 4–8 mg dexamethasone every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective.... The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted.... If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy.... After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached.... In this later situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition.... Intra-articular, soft tissue or intralesional administration The dose for intrasynovial administration is usually 2 to 4 mg for large joints and 0.8 to 1 mg for small joints.... For soft tissue and bursal injections a dose of 2 to 4 mg is recommended.... Ganglia require a dose of 1 to 2 mg.... A dose of 0.4 to 1 mg is used for injection into tendon sheaths.... Injection into intervertebral joints should not be attempted at any time and hip joint injection cannot be recommended as an office procedure.... Intrasynovial and soft tissue injections should be employed only when affected areas are limited to 1 or 2 sites.... Frequency of injection usually ranges from once every 3 to 5 days to once every 2 to 3 weeks.... Frequent intra-articular injection may cause damage to joint tissue.",,,,,,Oral

Usual doses are used to reduce severe bradycardia and syncope associated with hyperactive carotid sinus reflex.. For bradyarrhythmias the usual intravenous adult dosage ranges from 0.4 to 1 mg (4 to 10 mL of a 0.1 mg/mL solution) every one to two hours as needed; larger doses up to a maximum of 2 mg may be required.. In children, intravenous dosage ranges from 0.01 to 0.03 mg per kg of body weight.. When cardiac arrest has occurred, external cardiac massage or other method of resuscitation is required to distribute the drug after intravenous injection.. In anticholinesterase poisoning from exposure to insecticides, large doses of at least 2 to 3 mg (20 to 30 mL of a 0.1 mg/mL solution) should be administered parenterally and repeated until signs of atropine intoxication appear..

Clinical experience suggests the following recommendations: Oral Administration Initial Dosage Range Adults Moderate Symptomatology - 0.5 mg to 2 mg b.i.d.... Severe Symptomatology - 3 mg to 5 mg b.i.d.... Geriatric or Debilitated Patients - 0.5 mg to 2 mg b.i.d.... Chronic or Resistant Patients - 3 mg to 5 mg b.i.d.... Daily dosages up to 100 mg may be necessary in some cases to achieve an optimal response.... Infrequently, haloperidol has been used in doses above 100 mg for severely resistant patients; however, the limited clinical usage has not demonstrated the safety of prolonged administration of such doses.... Children The following recommendations apply to children between the ages of 3 and 12 years (weight range 15 kg to 40 kg).... Therapy should begin at the lowest dose possible (0.5 mg per day).... If required, the dose should be increased by an increment of 0.5 mg at 5 to 7 day intervals until the desired therapeutic effect is obtained.... (See chart below.) The total dose may be divided, to be given b.i.d....

There is little evidence that behavior improvement is further enhanced in dosages beyond 6 mg per day.... Maintenance Dosage Upon achieving a satisfactory therapeutic response, dosage should then be gradually reduced to the lowest effective maintenance level....

This preparation may be administered by intravenous injection, by intravenous infusion, or by intramuscular injection, the preferred method for initial emergency use being intravenous injection.. Following the initial emergency period, consideration should be given to employing a longer acting injectable preparation or an oral preparation.. Therapy is initiated by administering hydrocortisone sodium succinate for injection intravenously over a period of 30 seconds (e.g., 100 mg) to 10 minutes (e.g., 500 mg or more).. Under such circumstances, it may be desirable to replace hydrocortisone sodium succinate for injection with a corticoid such as methylprednisolone sodium succinate which causes little or no sodium retention.. The initial dose of hydrocortisone sodium succinate for injection is 100 mg to 500 mg, depending on the specific disease entity being treated.. However, in certain overwhelming, acute, life-threatening situations, administration in dosages exceeding the usual dosages may be justified and may be in multiples of the oral dosages.. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage that maintains an adequate clinical response is reached.. In pediatric patients, the initial dose of hydrocortisone may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated.. The range of initial doses is 0.56 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses (20 mg/m2bsa/day to 240 mg/m2bsa/day).. For the purpose of comparison, the following is the equivalent milligram dosage of the various glucocorticoids: Cortisone, 25 Triamcinolone, 4 Hydrocortisone, 20 Paramethasone, 2 Prednisolone, 5 Betamethasone, 0.75 Prednisone, 5 Dexamethasone, 0.75 Methylprednisolone, 4 These dose relationships apply only to oral or intravenous administration of these compounds.. When these substances or their derivatives are injected intramuscularly or into joint spaces, their relative properties may be greatly altered.. Preparation of Solutions: 100 mg Plain-For intravenous or intramuscular injection, prepare solution by aseptically adding not more than 2 mL of Bacteriostatic Water for Injection or Bacteriostatic Sodium Chloride Injection to the contents of one vial.. For intravenous infusion, first prepare solution by adding not more than 2 mL of Bacteriostatic Water for Injection to the vial; this solution may then be added to 100 mL to 1,000 mL of the following: 5% dextrose in water (or isotonic saline solution or 5% dextrose in isotonic saline solution if patient is not on sodium restriction)..
