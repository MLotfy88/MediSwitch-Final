    "toxicity": "In the management of intraocular hemorrhage, particularly with interventions such as pharmacological treatments, surgeries, or procedures, addressing potential toxicity and adverse effects is essential. Effective management requires a multidisciplinary approach, close monitoring, and proactive patient engagement to ensure optimal outcomes and mitigate risks associated with treatment.\n[69]\n\nPharmacological Management\n\nCorticosteroids: These medications are used to reduce inflammation, but they can also increase intraocular pressure, cause cataract formation, or delay wound healing. Monitoring intraocular pressure and providing adjunct treatments such as anti-glaucoma medications may be necessary.\nAntibiotics: Prophylactic antibiotics are often administered postoperatively. However, they can cause allergic reactions or antibiotic resistance. Therefore, it is necessary to use antibiotics with an appropriate spectrum and monitor for signs of adverse reactions.\nAnticoagulants/antiplatelets: These drugs, which are used for various systemic conditions, may exacerbate bleeding. A careful risk-benefit analysis is required, especially in patients with a history of bleeding.\n[70]\n\nSurgical Management\n\nVitrectomy: This is a common procedure utilized for dense vitreous hemorrhage, and it may carry risks, including retinal detachment, endophthalmitis, or progression of cataracts. Close postoperative monitoring and prompt management of any complications are crucial for optimal outcomes.\nLaser therapy: This is used to treat underlying causes of hemorrhage. Laser photocoagulation can lead to peripheral visual field loss, macular edema, or scarring. Thus, accurate targeting and minimizing exposure are essential to mitigate these risks.\n[71]\n\nMonitoring and Preventive Strategies\n\nRoutine monitoring: Regular follow-ups are recommended for detecting early signs of toxicity, particularly in patients undergoing long-term pharmacotherapy.\nPatient education: Patients should be educated about recognizing symptoms of toxicity, including visual disturbances, eye pain, or systemic adverse effects, and encouraged to report these symptoms promptly.\nTailoring treatment: The treatment plan should be adjusted based on individual risk factors for toxicity, particularly for patients with preexisting conditions that may increase their susceptibility to adverse effects."
