Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders; such disorders are the strongest predictors of suicide.  Patients of all ages treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the first few months of drug therapy, and at times of dose changes.
