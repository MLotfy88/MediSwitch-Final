    "toxicity": "Neurotrophic keratitis management involves various pharmacological and surgical interventions, some of which have associated toxicities and adverse effects. Recognizing and mitigating these effects are crucial to optimizing treatment outcomes.\n\nTable\nTable 8. Adverse Effects of Pharmacologic Therapies.\n\nTable\nTable 9. Toxicities of Surgical and Biological Interventions.\n\nStrategies for Managing Toxicities and Adverse Effects\n\nMonitoring for early signs of adverse effects is crucial during neurotrophic keratitis treatment. Regular corneal examinations and IOP monitoring help identify steroid-related complications. Additionally, frequent corneal sensitivity testing is important for patients undergoing long-term neurotrophic keratitis therapy to detect any changes in corneal nerve function.\n[107]\n\nTo reduce medication-related toxicity, preservative-free lubricants should be preferred to minimize irritation. The chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or anesthetics should be avoided, as these agents can exacerbate epithelial damage.\n[108]\n\nOptimizing surgical interventions is also key. Scleral contact lenses should be closely monitored for the risk of corneal hypoxia and infection. If amniotic membrane grafts show signs of nonadherence or infection, they should be replaced promptly to prevent further complications.\n[109]\n\nPatient education plays an essential role in treatment adherence. Patients should be encouraged to comply with aseptic techniques when using serum eye drops. Before initiating aggressive therapies, the risks and benefits should be thoroughly discussed with the patient.\n[110]\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nAdverse effects of neurotrophic keratitis treatments must be anticipated and managed proactively. Regular follow-up is critical to detect complications early. A personalized approach that balances treatment efficacy with potential toxicities ensures the best outcomes. Addressing toxicity risks early improves treatment adherence, leading to better visual outcomes for patients with neurotrophic keratitis."
