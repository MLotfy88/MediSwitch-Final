Because vitamin E is an antioxidant, pharmacologic doses could theoretically interfere with radiation therapy and chemotherapeutic agents whose cytotoxic mechanism depends on generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that damage DNA and proteins, including but not limited to alkylating agents (e.g., busulfan, cyclophosphamide, melphalan), anthracyclines (e.g., doxorubicin, epirubicin), platinum coordination complexes (e.g., cisplatin, carboplatin), DNA topoisomerase inhibitors (e.g., etoposide, teniposide, irinotecan, topotecan), and photodynamic agents (e.g., porfimer).
