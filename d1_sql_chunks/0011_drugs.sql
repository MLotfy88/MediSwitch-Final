More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Rosuvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [simvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] This is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than [atorvastatin]''s effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial[A181427] concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.

Rosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]','["C10BX10", "C10BX05", "C10BX07", "C10AA07", "A10BH52", "G01AE10", "C10BX13", "C10BX09", "C10BA09", "C10BX16", "C10BX17", "C10BX14", "C10BA06"]','[]'),(9122,'Aaa','ششش','25','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',799,'2022-12-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9123,'Octagam 2.5 gm/50ml vial 50 ml','اوكتاجام 2.5جم/50مل فيال 50مل','8,620','2658','','Human normal immunoglobulin','Octapharma > ramco','Vial','فيال','2.5 gm','1','','','','',2795,'2025-02-01',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9124,'Octatron 20 caps','اوكتاترون 20 كبسولة','51','','Antioxidant','Biotin+mixed bioflvonoids+selenium+molybdenum+vitamin(a+c+e)+zinc','Eimc > nerhadou international co.','Cap','كبسولة','','2','','','6224008097563','',2191,'2022-12-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9125,'Octatron 30 caps','اوكتاترون 30 كبسولة','135','114','Antioxidant','Biotin+mixed bioflvonoids+selenium+molybdenum+vitamin(a+c+e)+zinc','Eimc > nerhadou international co.','Cap','كبسولة','','3','مضاد للأكسدة','','6224008097112','',19392,'2025-01-12',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9126,'Aaa','ششش','75','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','0','','','','',712,'2022-08-15',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9127,'Aaa','ششش','7','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',730,'2022-12-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9130,'Octomotol 110 mg 30 tab.','اوكتوموتول 110مجم 30 قرص','18','','Nsaid.analgesic','Bumadizone calcium','October pharma','Tab','أقراص','110 mg','3','','indications: -acute and chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases: arthroses spondyloses and extraarticular rheumatism after surgical interventions and irradiations in all fields of clinical medicine . -open and closed injuries : contusions sprains fracture','6221088010017','',1383,'2022-12-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'M01AB07',NULL),(9131,'Octosemide-k e.r 10 tab.','اوكتوسيميد كيه 10 اقراص','7','','Diuretic','Furosemide+potasium chloride','October pharma','Tab','أقراص','','1','','description a benzoic-sulfonamide-furan. it is a diuretic with fast onset and short duration that is used for edema and chronic renal insufficiency. mechanism of action furosemide a loop diuretic inhibits water reabsorption in the nephron by blocking the','6221088010031','',756,'2022-12-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9136,'Octovent 4mg c.r. 20 tab','اوكتوفنت سي ار 4مجم 20 قرص','24','12','Bronchodilator','Salbutamol','October pharma','Tab','أقراص','4mg','2','موسع للشعب الهوائية ومهدئ للكحة.','','6221088010079','',6081,'2025-11-18',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Salbutamol is a short-acting, selective beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist used in the treatment of asthma and COPD. It is 29 times more selective for beta2 receptors than beta1 receptors giving it higher specificity for pulmonary beta receptors versus beta1-adrenergic receptors located in the heart. Salbutamol is formulated as a racemic mixture of the R- and S-isomers. The R-isomer has 150 times greater affinity for the beta2-receptor than the S-isomer and the S-isomer has been associated with toxicity. This lead to the development of levalbuterol, the single R-isomer of salbutamol. However, the high cost of levalbuterol compared to salbutamol has deterred wide-spread use of this enantiomerically pure version of the drug. Salbutamol is generally used for acute episodes of bronchospasm caused by bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis and other chronic bronchopulmonary disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD).

Diclofenac was first approved by the FDA in July 1988 under the trade name Voltaren, marketed by Novartis (previously Ciba-Geigy).[L7360]','["S01CC01", "S01BC03", "M01AB55", "M02AA15", "M01AB05", "D11AX18"]','[]'),(9199,'Aaa','ششش','21','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','0','','','','',664,'2022-11-13',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9201,'Olohistine 0.1% eye drops 5 ml','اولوهيستين 0.1% قطرة عين 5 مل','23','','Ophthalmic antihistaminic','Olopatadine','Eipico','Drops','نقط','0.1%','1','','about olopatadine (eye pre.) second generation h1 antagonist and mast cell stabilizer ophthalmic antihistaminic. indications for olopatadine (eye pre.) allergic conjunctivitis typical dosage for olopatadine (eye pre.) apply one drop in each affected eye 2','6221032331601','',2640,'2022-12-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'None','[]','[]'),(9202,'Olopatanol 0.1% eye drops 5 ml','اولوباتانول 1مجم/مل نقط للعين 5 مل','17','','Ophthalmic antihistaminic','Olopatadine','Grand pharma > marcyrl co.','Drops','نقط','0.1%','1','','about olopatadine (eye pre.) second generation h1 antagonist and mast cell stabilizer ophthalmic antihistaminic. indications for olopatadine (eye pre.) allergic conjunctivitis typical dosage for olopatadine (eye pre.) apply one drop in each affected eye 2','6223003579579','',2685,'2022-12-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'None','[]','[]'),(9203,'Omega 3 complex 30 caps','اوميجا - 3 كومبلكس 30 كبسولة','150','','','Omega3-flax-borage','Company','Cap','كبسولة','','1','','','','',2966,'2022-06-18',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9204,'Omega 3-safe 1250 mg 60 caps.','اوميجا 3 سيف 1250مجم 60 كبسولة','250','400','Omega 3','Fish oil','Safe pharma','Cap','كبسولة','1250 mg','6','خفض مستوي الدهون الثلاثية -- تعزيز صحة القلب والدماغ','','6223009560212','',2855,'2024-04-03',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9205,'Omega 3 napco syrup 100 ml','اوميجا 3 نابكو شراب 100 مل','130','98','Omega 3','Cod liver oil','Napco pharma','Syrup','شراب','100 ml','1','','','','',2215,'2024-11-18',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'D03AA',NULL),(9206,'Omega-3 plus 30 caps.','اوميجا-3 بلس 30 كبسولة','135','135','Omega 3','Omega-3 fish oil+wheat germ oil','Sedico','Cap','كبسولة','','3','1- حالات ضعف الذاكرة والنسيان المتكرر.','','6221042164138','',30726,'2025-02-19',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9207,'Zincobrand syrup 125 ml','زنكوبراند شراب 125 مل','65','59','','','Company','Syrup','شراب','125 ml','1','','','6224011457040','',1898,'2025-08-02',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9208,'Aaa','ششش','60','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','0','','','','',678,'2022-07-09',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9211,'Omegafit 1000 mg 14 sachets','اوميجافيت 1000مجم 14 كيس','165','150','Omega 3','Omega-3 fish oil','Dulex lab > nutra med international','Sachet','أكياس','1000 mg','1','','*indication: dietary supplement rich in omega-3 multivitamins minerals and trace elements.','6224009413157','',1300,'2024-08-10',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9212,'Aaa','ششش','110','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','0','','','','',801,'2022-07-09',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9213,'Aaa','ششش','60','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','0','','','6224007394564','',688,'2023-08-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9214,'Aaa','ششش','30','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',743,'2023-07-11',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9215,'Omegapress 0.1 mg 30 tabs.','اوميجابرس 0.1مجم 30 قرص','288','219','Urinary incotinence.antidiuretic','Desmopressin acetate','Atco pharma > omega pharmaceutical and chemical industries (opci)','Tab','أقراص','0.1 mg','3','علاج التبول الا ارادي -- التحكم في التبول','about desmopressin synthetic analogue of natural pituitary hormone 8-arginine vasopressin (adh) antidiuretic hormone in diabetes insipidus hemostatic agent antihemophilic agent. mechanism of action of desmopressin the drug exerts it`s antidiuretic action','6224009194018','',5368,'2024-07-27',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Desmopressin (dDAVP), a synthetic analogue of 8-arginine vasopressin (ADH), is an antidiuretic peptide drug modified by deamination of 1-cysteine and substitution of 8-L-arginine by 8-D-arginine. ADH is an endogenous pituitary hormone that has a crucial role in the control of the water content in the body. Upon release from the stimulation of increased plasma osmolarity or decreased circulating blood volume, ADH mainly acts on the cells of the distal part of the nephron and the collecting tubules in the kidney [T28]. The hormone interacts with V1, V2 or V3 receptors with differing signal cascade systems.

Desmopressin displays enhanced antidiuretic potency, fewer pressor effects due to V2-selective actions, and a prolonged half-life and duration of action compared to endogenous ADH [A31661]. It has been employed clinically since 1972 and is available in various formulations including intranasal solution, intravenous solution, oral tablet and oral lyophilisate [A31662]. Desmopressin is indicated for the treatment of polyuric conditions including primary nocturnal enuresis, nocturia, and diabetes insipidus. It was also newly approved for the treatment of mild classical hemophilia and von Willebrand''s disease for minor surgeries. The active ingredient in most formulations is desmopressin acetate. Nocdurna, or desmopressin acetate, was approved by the FDA on June 21st, 2018 for the treatment of nocturia due to nocturnal polyuria in adults.

Structurally, ergocalciferol differs from cholecalciferol in that it possesses a double bond between C22 and C23 and has an additional methyl group at C24 [L5689]. Finally, ergocalciferol is pharmacologically less potent than cholecalciferol, which makes vitamin D3 the preferred agent for medical use [L5689].

Appropriate levels of vitamin D must be upheld in the body in order to maintain calcium and phosphorus levels in a healthy physiologic range to sustain a variety of metabolic functions, transcription regulation, and bone metabolism [A223, L5689, L1782, L5771, F4027, F4042, F4048].

Semaglutide was developed by Novo Nordisk and approved by the FDA for subcutaneous injection in December 2017.[L8681] The tablet formulation was approved for oral administration in September 2019. Semaglutide works by binding to and activating the GLP-1 receptor, thereby stimulating insulin secretion and reducing blood glucose.[L8678]

The subcutaneous injection is administered once weekly and the tablet is administered once a day. Semaglutide offers a competitive advantage over other drugs used to manage diabetes, which may require several daily doses.

Diclofenac was first approved by the FDA in July 1988 under the trade name Voltaren, marketed by Novartis (previously Ciba-Geigy).[L7360]','["S01CC01", "S01BC03", "M01AB55", "M02AA15", "M01AB05", "D11AX18"]','[]'),(9318,'Optozoline eye drops 10 ml','اوبتوزولين قطرة للعين 10مل','24','12','Corneal vascularity.antihistamine combined with alpha 1 agonist','Chlorpheniramine+naphazoline','Cid','Drops','نقط','10 ml','1','','','6221043011592','',939,'2025-08-03',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9320,'Aaa','ششش','30','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',761,'2022-12-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9323,'Aaa','ششش','30','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',766,'2022-12-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9325,'Ora.zed mouth wash 120ml','اورا زد مضمضة للفم 120 مل','40','28','Mouth wash','Menthol+cinnamon oil+clove oil','Top.z pharma','Mouth wash','غسول للفم','120ml','1','','','6225000029132','',1068,'2025-08-03',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL);

The result of doing so allows cGMP present in both the penis and pulmonary vasculature to elicit smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation that subsequently facilitates relief in pulmonary arterial hypertension and the increased flow of blood into the spongy erectile tissue of the penis that consequently allows it to grow in size and become erect and rigid [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

Interestingly enough, it is precisely via this mechanism why sildenafil was at first researched as a potential treatment for angina - or chest pain associated with inadequate blood flow to the heart - before being serendipitously indicated for treating erectile dysfunction in the late 1980s [A175732]. Nevertheless, it is because of this mechanism that sildenafil is also indicated for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension but is also additionally notorious for interacting with various anti-anginal or anti-hypertensive agents to develop potentially rapid, excessive, and/or fatal hypotensive crises [A175579, A175582, A175654].

Regardless, sildenafil, among a variety of other similar or related PDE5 inhibitors, has become a common and effective treatment for erectile dysfunction and since its formal approval for medical use in the public in 1998 [A175732], continues to see millions of prescriptions written for it internationally. Although the medication has historically been most popularly recognized as Pfizer''s brand name Viagra, sildenafil is currently available generically and even as a non-prescription over the counter medication in some countries [L5656].','["G01AE10", "G04BE03"]','[]'),(9345,'Aaa','ششش','16','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',722,'2022-12-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9346,'C-mix 20 sachets','سي ميكس 20 كيس','60','','Vitamin c +zinc (multi vitamin )','Vitamin c 500 mg+zinc','Tadawena','Sachet','أكياس','','1','','','','',1142,'2024-07-08',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9347,'Orasan mouth wash 125 ml','اورازان مضمضة 125 مل','45','35','Oral care','Clove oil+menthol','Hi-care > pixel pharmaceutical company','Mouth wash','غسول للفم','125 ml','1','','','6224001202322','',1143,'2024-04-20',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9348,'Aaa','ششش','8','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',659,'2022-12-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9350,'Oraven mouth wash 200 ml','اورافين غسول للفم 200 مل','45','35','Oral care','','Hi-care > rovamed pharma','Mouth wash','غسول للفم','200 ml','1','','','6224000201951','',780,'2024-05-22',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9351,'Oravit b12 sr 10 cap','اورافيت ب12 م المفعول 10 كبسولات','18','','Vitamin b','Vitamin b12','Sovalue pharma','Cap','كبسولة','','1','','','6221051020692','',1410,'2022-12-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'B03BA',NULL),(9352,'Orazone 0.1mg/ml syrup 120ml','اورازون شراب 120 مل','36','25','Glucocorticoid','Dexamethasone','Arab drug company.','Syrup','شراب','0.1mg','1','','about dexamethasone a potent synthetic glucocorticoid antiasthmatic anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant. mechanism of action of dexamethasone the drug exerts it`s pharmacological action by penetrating and binding to cytoplasmic receptor protein and ca','6221060003280','',3199,'2024-09-01',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Dexamethasone, or MK-125, is a corticosteroid fluorinated at position 9 used to treat endocrine, rheumatic, collagen, dermatologic, allergic, ophthalmic, gastrointestinal, respiratory, hematologic, neoplastic, edematous, and other conditions.[L10701] Developed in 1957, it is structurally similar to other corticosteroids like [hydrocortisone] and [prednisolone].[A188724]

However, it has a negligible effect on altering the development and progression of breast cancer itself.[label] The most common causes of osteoporosis include postmenopausal deficiency of estrogen and age-related deterioration in bone homeostasis. Due to the risk of bone fractures that may lead to morbidities and reduced quality of life, the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women with the use of therapeutic agents in addition to concurrent therapies is critical. Due to the decline in estrogen levels in postmenopausal osteoporosis, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), such as estradiol, has been used to ameliorate the condition. However, due to the off-target actions by HRT, newer non-hormonal agents such as raloxifene and [tamoxifen] have been developed to reduce adverse events through selective pharmacological actions on tissue-specific therapeutic targets.[T28]

The main effects of raloxifene are to preserve the bone mineral density and decrease the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Compared to estrogen and tamoxifen, raloxifene was not associated with an increased risk of uterine cancer and it does not cause endometrial proliferation.[A716] Although rare, there was an increased risk of venous thromboembolism during clinical trials of postmenopausal women receiving raloxifene. In addition, a clinical study consisting of postmenopausal women with documented coronary heart disease or at increased risk for coronary events showed an increased risk for fatal stroke with raloxifene therapy compared to placebo.[label] It is strongly advised that the risk-benefit ratio is considered before starting raloxifene therapy in women at risk of thromboembolic disease or strokes, such as the prior history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, or cigarette smoking.[label]','["G03XC01"]','[]'),(9421,'Aaa','ششش','12','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',667,'2022-08-10',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9422,'Osteorine 50 mg 30 caps','اوستيورين 50 مجم 30 كبسولة','98','','Anti-inflammatory','Diacerin','Medizen pharmaceutical industries','Cap','كبسولة','50 mg','2','','','','',739,'2022-08-10',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9423,'Aaa','ششش','26','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',701,'2022-08-10',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9426,'Osteocare liquid 120 ml','اوستيوكير شراب 120 مل','65','65','Calcium supplement','Calcium carbonate+magnesium carbonate+vitamin d3+zinc','Vitabiotics','Unknown','غير محدد','120 ml','1','','','6224001078729','',12065,'2024-11-04',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9427,'osteocare 30 tabs','اوستيوكير 30 قرص','180','150','Calcium supplement','calcium carbonate+magnesium carbonate+vitamin d3+zinc','vitabiotics','tablet','أقراص','','2','مكمل غذائى لدعم صحة العظام والوقاية من الكساح وهشاشة العظام

Esomeprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of esomeprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, esomeprazole''s duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]

PPIs such as esomeprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as esomeprazole has been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients such as iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]

Rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as esomeprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion.[A177574] Esomeprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing to prevent this rebound effect.','["A02BD06", "A02BC05", "M01AE52"]','[]'),(9473,'Ovestin 1mg 20 tab','اوفيستين 1مجم 20 قرص','11','','Estrogen','Estriol','Sedico > schering plough','Tab','أقراص','1mg','2','','','6221042033021','',1324,'2022-12-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'G03CA04',NULL),(9475,'Oxaleptal 600mg 30 f.c. tabs.','اوكساليبتال 600مجم 30 قرص','303','231','Anti-epileptic.carboxamides','Oxcarbazepine','Mash premiere','Tab','أقراص','600mg','3','علاج الصرع -- تقليل التشنجات الناتجة عن الصرع','','6222001406764','',4042,'2024-07-10',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Oxcarbazepine is an anti-epileptic medication used in the treatment of partial onset seizures that was first approved for use in the United States in 2000.[L8627,L8630,L8633] It is a structural derivative of [carbamazepine][A186101] and exerts a majority of its activity via a pharmacologically active metabolite, MHD, which exists as a racemate in the blood - a pro-drug of the more active (S)-enantiomer is also marketed as a separate anti-epileptic under the name [eslicarbazepine].[A186011] Compared to other anti-epileptic drugs, which are generally metabolized via the cytochrome P450 system, oxcarbazepine has a reduced propensity for involvement in drug-drug interactions owing to its primarily reductive metabolism.[A186032]','["N03AF02"]','[]'),(9476,'Oxaleptal 60mg/ml oral susp. 100ml','اوكساليبتال 60مجم/مل معلق 100 مل','89','66','Anti-epileptic.carboxamides','Oxcarbazepine','Mash premiere','Susp','معلق','60mg','1','علاج الصرع -- تقليل التشنجات الناتجة عن الصرع','about oxcarbazepine carboxamide derivative iminostilbenes anticonvulsant mood stabilizing agent. mechanism of action of oxcarbazepine oxcarbazepine prolongs the inactivated state of voltage sensitive neuronal sodium ion channel either by increasing the ef','6222001400366','',1562,'2024-07-20',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Oxcarbazepine is an anti-epileptic medication used in the treatment of partial onset seizures that was first approved for use in the United States in 2000.[L8627,L8630,L8633] It is a structural derivative of [carbamazepine][A186101] and exerts a majority of its activity via a pharmacologically active metabolite, MHD, which exists as a racemate in the blood - a pro-drug of the more active (S)-enantiomer is also marketed as a separate anti-epileptic under the name [eslicarbazepine].[A186011] Compared to other anti-epileptic drugs, which are generally metabolized via the cytochrome P450 system, oxcarbazepine has a reduced propensity for involvement in drug-drug interactions owing to its primarily reductive metabolism.[A186032]','["N03AF02"]','[]'),(9477,'Aaa','ششش','1,400','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',760,'2022-08-15',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9478,'Aaa','ششش','800','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',627,'2022-08-15',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9479,'Msg-fer 120 ml syrup','ام اس جي فير شراب 120 مل','49','','Multivitamin','Ferrous bisglycinate + vit b6 + vit b12','Msg pharma','Syrup','شراب','120 ml','1','','','','',652,'2022-08-17',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9480,'Kaveda oral drops 30ml','كافيدا نقط بالفم 30 مل','65','55','Multivitamins','Iron+vitamins','Organix','Drops','نقط','30ml','1','مكمل غذائى لعلاج حالات الانيميا ودعم صحة الجسم','','6225000605640','',3142,'2024-02-24',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9481,'Soft lax massage cream 40 gm','سوفت لاكس مساج كريم 40 جم','55','40','Massage cream','Camphor oil+menthol crystals','Aglan pharma','Cream','كريم','40 gm','1','','','6224007331095','',1227,'2024-12-01',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9482,'Jonmera rosehip 10 sachets','جونميرا روزهيب 10 اكياس','350','295','Anti-rheumatic.osteoarthritis.anabolic agents','Gelatin (collagen) hydrolysate+rosehip ext.+vitamin c','Rotabiogen','Sachet','أكياس','','1','','','6224009665402','',1316,'2024-07-27',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9483,'Oxazin 10mg 20 tab.','اوكسازين 10مجم 20 قرص','12','','Psychiatric.anxiolytics-hypnotics','Oxazepam','Horus for pharmaceutical products','Tab','أقراص','10mg','2','مهدي ومضاد للقلق -- علاج نفسي','about oxazepam anxiolytic benzodiazepines mechanism of action of oxazepam similar to other benzodiazepines oxazepam exerts its anxiolytic effects by potentiating the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba) on gaba-a receptors through a cooperative mechan','','',1168,'2022-10-30',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Oxazepam is an intermediate-acting, 3-hydroxybenzodiazepine used in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal and anxiety disorders.

SMSs were developed because there are many different subtypes of serotonin receptors, however, not all of these receptors appear to be involved in the antidepressant effects of SRIs. Some serotonin receptors seem to play a relatively neutral or insignificant role in the regulation of mood, but others, such as 5-HT1A autoreceptors and 5-HT7 receptors, appear to play an oppositional role in the efficacy of SRIs in treating depression.','["N06AX26"]','[]'),(9565,'Panadol extra 48 f.c. tabs.','بانادول اكسترا 48 قرص','108','68','Mild analgesic','Caffeine+paracetamol(acetaminophen)','Alexandria > glaxo smithkline','Tab','أقراص','','4','','','6222010611326','',14341,'2024-07-29',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9566,'Panadol joint 18 er tabs.

It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infections along with other antibiotics including [amoxicillin], [clarithromycin], and [metronidazole], for example.[A177271][F4498] Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [omeprazole], [esomeprazole], [lansoprazole], [dexlansoprazole], and [rabeprazole].

Pantoprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cell. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of pantoprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, pantoprazole''s duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as pantoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]

PPIs such as pantoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]

PPIs such as pantoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]

It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infections along with other antibiotics including [amoxicillin], [clarithromycin], and [metronidazole], for example.[A177271][F4498] Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [omeprazole], [esomeprazole], [lansoprazole], [dexlansoprazole], and [rabeprazole].

Pantoprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cell. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of pantoprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, pantoprazole''s duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]

Semaglutide was developed by Novo Nordisk and approved by the FDA for subcutaneous injection in December 2017.[L8681] The tablet formulation was approved for oral administration in September 2019.

The subcutaneous injection is administered once weekly and the tablet is administered once a day. Semaglutide offers a competitive advantage over other drugs used to manage diabetes, which may require several daily doses. Clinical trials have determined that this drug reduces glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels and reduces body weight, proving to be effective for patients with type 2 diabetes.[A186053] In June 2021, semaglutide was approved by the FDA for chronic weight management in adults with general obesity or overweight who have at least one weight-related condition, marking semaglutide as the first approved drug for such use since 2014.[L34485] The use of semaglutide in weight management is also approved by Health Canada [L39347] and the EMA.[L41335]','["A10BJ06"]','[]'),(9813,'Powercaps 20 caps.','باوركابس 20 كبسولة','40','25','Cold drugs','Ibuprofen+pseudoephedrine','Chemipharm','Cap','كبسولة','','2','علاج احتقان وانسداد الأنف.','','6222006500429','',11648,'2024-07-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9815,'Aaa','ششش','45','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',821,'2022-08-05',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9819,'Progest 100mg 24 oral/vaginal caps.','بروجيست 100مجم 24 كبسولة فموي / مهبلي','110','76','Progesterone replacement','Progesterone','Pharco','Cap','كبسولة','100mg','2','علاج نقص هرمون البروجسترون -- مشاكل الدورة الشهرية','indication for progesterone supplementation or replacement as part of an assisted reproductive technology (art) treatment for infertile women with progesterone deficiency and for the treatment of secondary amenorrhea. also used for the reduction of the in','6223000013571','',9135,'2024-09-19',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Progesterone is a hormone that occurs naturally in females, and is essential for endometrial receptivity, embryo implantation, and the successful establishment of pregnancy.

Risperidone binds with a very high affinity to 5-HT2A receptors, approximately 10-20 fold greater than the drug''s binding affinity to D2 receptors, and carries lesser activity at several off-targets which may responsible for some of its undesirable effects.[L12885]','["N05AX08"]','[]'),(9903,'Aaa','ششش','770','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',748,'2022-08-02',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9905,'Aaa','ششش','40','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',900,'2023-06-28',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9906,'Aaa','ششش','65','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',753,'2023-06-28',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9907,'Aaa','ششش','51','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',821,'2023-06-28',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(9909,'Risperidone 3mg 30 f.c. tab.','ريسبيريدون 3مجم 30 اقراص','105','60','Psychiatric.antipsychotics','Risperidone','Pharopharma','Tab','أقراص','3mg','3','','about risperidone second-generation antipsychotic benzisoxazole derivative antimanic atypical antipsychotic. mechanism of action of risperidone risperidone exerts its antipsychotic activity by blocking dopamine and serotonin (5ht2) receptors. the drug has','6221094037077','',2632,'2024-12-31',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Risperidone is a second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) medication used in the treatment of a number of mood and mental health conditions including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.[L12885] It is one of the most widely used SGAs.

It is marketed by the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline as a stand-alone drug (Avandia) and in combination with metformin (Avandamet) or with glimepiride (Avandaryl). Like other thiazolidinediones, the mechanism of action of rosiglitazone is by activation of the intracellular receptor class of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), specifically PPARγ. Rosiglitazone is a selective ligand of PPARγ, and has no PPARα-binding action. Apart from its effect on insulin resistance, it appears to have an anti-inflammatory effect: nuclear factor kappa-B (NFκB) levels fall and inhibitor (IκB) levels increase in patients on rosiglitazone. Recent research has suggested that rosiglitazone may also be of benefit to a subset of patients with Alzheimer''s disease not expressing the ApoE4 allele.

More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Rosuvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [simvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] This is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than [atorvastatin]''s effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial[A181427] concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.

Rosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]','["C10BX10", "C10BX05", "C10BX07", "C10AA07", "A10BH52", "G01AE10", "C10BX13", "C10BX09", "C10BA09", "C10BX16", "C10BX17", "C10BX14", "C10BA06"]','[]'),(10019,'Rosuvast 5mg 14 f.c.tab','روزوفاست 5مجم 14 قرص','53','42','Antihyperlipidemic.statins','Rosuvastatin','Chemipharm','Tab','أقراص','5mg','2','علاج ارتفاع نسبة الكوليسترول في الدم --علاج نسبة الدهون في الدم -- الحفاظ علي صحة القلب و الاوعية الدموية من التجلطات','','6222006501945','',1952,'2023-09-08',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Rosuvastatin, also known as the brand name product Crestor, is a lipid-lowering drug that belongs to the statin class of medications, which are used to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and manage elevated lipid levels by inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver.

Appropriate levels of vitamin D must be upheld in the body in order to maintain calcium and phosphorus levels in a healthy physiologic range to sustain a variety of metabolic functions, transcription regulation, and bone metabolism [A223, L5689, L1782, L5771, F4027, F4042, F4048]. However, studies are also ongoing to determine whether or not cholecalciferol may also play certain roles in cancer, autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular disease, and other medical conditions that may be associated with vitamin D deficiency [L5689].','["M05BB09", "M05BX53", "M05BB07", "M05BB08", "A11CC55", "M05BB05", "A11CC05", "M05BB03", "M05BB04"]','[]');

Ergocalciferol was isolated for the first time from yeast in 1931 and its structure was elucidated in 1932.[T580]

Ergocalciferol is considered the first vitamin D analog and is differentiated from [cholecalciferol] by the presence of a double bond between C22 and C23 and the presence of a methyl group at C24. These modifications reduce the affinity of ergocalciferol for the vitamin D binding protein resulting in faster clearance, limits its activation, and alters its catabolism.[A177637]

Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Lovastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [simvastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] Increasing use of the statin class of drugs is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, [rosuvastatin] is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg [rosuvastatin] per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels, while lovastatin has been found to have an average decrease in LDL-C of 25-40%.[A174580,A181409,A181535,A181538,A1793] Potency is thought to correlate to tissue permeability as the more lipophilic statins such as lovastatin are thought to enter endothelial cells by passive diffusion, as opposed to hydrophilic statins such as [pravastatin] and [rosuvastatin] which are taken up into hepatocytes through OATP1B1 (organic anion transporter protein 1B1)-mediated transport.[A181424,A181460] Despite these differences in potency, several trials have demonstrated only minimal differences in terms of clinical outcomes between statins.[A181538, A181427]','["C10AA02", "C10BA01"]','[]'),(10130,'Aaa','ششش','15','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',654,'2022-09-28',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10132,'Saboctic 300mg 20 f.c. tab','سابوكتيك 300مجم 20 قرص','34','','Antioxidant','Thioctic acid(alpha lipoic acid)','Mepaco > activa therapeutics','Tab','أقراص','300mg','2','مضاد اكسدة','','6224000808051','',1606,'2022-02-18',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'A16AX01',NULL),(10133,'Saboctic 600mg 20 f.c. tab','سابوكتيك 600مجم 20 قرص','63','','Antioxidant','Thioctic acid(alpha lipoic acid)','Mepaco > activa therapeutics','Tab','أقراص','600mg','2','مضاد اكسدة','','6224000808068','',6342,'2022-02-18',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'A16AX01',NULL),(10134,'Aaa','ششش','20','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',663,'2022-12-08',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10135,'Sabril 500mg tablets (illegal import)','سابريل 500مجم اقراص مستورد','0','','Anti-epileptic. gaba analougs','Vigabatrin','Sanofi aventis','Tablet','أقراص','500mg','1','مضاد للتشنجات والصرع','','','',3001,'2022-07-15',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Vigabatrin is an analog of gamma-aminobutyric acid ([GABA]), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, used in the treatment of refractory seizures and infantile spasms.[L13616] It irreversibly inhibits the enzyme responsible for GABA metabolism, thereby increasing levels of circulating GABA.

The result of doing so allows cGMP present in both the penis and pulmonary vasculature to elicit smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation that subsequently facilitates relief in pulmonary arterial hypertension and the increased flow of blood into the spongy erectile tissue of the penis that consequently allows it to grow in size and become erect and rigid [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

Interestingly enough, it is precisely via this mechanism why sildenafil was at first researched as a potential treatment for angina - or chest pain associated with inadequate blood flow to the heart - before being serendipitously indicated for treating erectile dysfunction in the late 1980s [A175732]. Nevertheless, it is because of this mechanism that sildenafil is also indicated for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension but is also additionally notorious for interacting with various anti-anginal or anti-hypertensive agents to develop potentially rapid, excessive, and/or fatal hypotensive crises [A175579, A175582, A175654].

Regardless, sildenafil, among a variety of other similar or related PDE5 inhibitors, has become a common and effective treatment for erectile dysfunction and since its formal approval for medical use in the public in 1998 [A175732], continues to see millions of prescriptions written for it internationally. Although the medication has historically been most popularly recognized as Pfizer''s brand name Viagra, sildenafil is currently available generically and even as a non-prescription over the counter medication in some countries [L5656].','["G01AE10", "G04BE03"]','[]'),(10299,'Selectival 20 capsules','سيليكتيفال 20 كبسولة','100','30','Liver support supplements','Vitamin c+vitamin e+selenium+zinc+vitamin b12+silymarin+dandelion+folic acid','Egyphar','Capsule','كبسولة','','2','','selectival is formulated of different highly selected components each of them individually and i or together with other components of selectival plays an essential role in preserving and protecting liver cells from different harmful and threatening factor','6224001026423','',2907,'2024-06-01',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10301,'Selenium vit 30 tablets','سيلينيوم فيت 30 قرص','100','','Multivitamins','Vitamin A+vitamin E+vitamin C+selenium','Jedco','Tablet','أقراص','','3','فيتامينات متعددة','','','',5020,'2023-02-05',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10302,'Selenium daily vit 30 tabs','سيلنيوم ديلي فيت 30 قرص','100','95','Multivitamins','Selenium+vitamin a+vitamin e+vitamin c','Zoser pharma','Tab','أقراص','','3','','','','http://www.evapharma.com/portfolio/milga-advance/',1468,'2024-07-02',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10303,'Selgon 40mg/ml oral drops 15 ml','سيلجون نقط فم 15 مل','16','','Anti-cough','Pipazethate','Eipico','Drops','نقط','40mg','1','','indication for the treatment of cough. pharmacodynamics antitussive agents act centrally on the medullary cough center.','6221032230188','',1229,'2022-12-13',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10304,'Selgon 20mg 20 tabs.','سيلجون 20مجم 20 قرص','30','18','Anti-cough','Pipazethate','Eipico','Tab','أقراص','20mg','2','حالات الكحة الجافة','','6221032115058','',9945,'2024-10-24',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10306,'Aaa','ششش','13','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',773,'2022-12-08',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10307,'Aaa','ششش','20','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',710,'2023-04-25',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10308,'Aaa','ششش','21','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',809,'2023-04-25',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10309,'Selsun blue 118 ml balanced shampoo (n/a)','سيلسن بلو 118 مل شامبو','35','','Hair care','Selenium sulfide','Famar > ramco','Amp','أمبول','118 ml','1','شامبو لنظافة الشعر --الحفاظ علي الشعر من التلف','anti-dandruff shampoo','','',851,'2023-04-28',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Selenium Sulfide is an antifungal agent as well as a cytostatic agent, slowing the growth of hyperproliferative cells in seborrhea.

It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infections along with other antibiotics including [DB01060], [DB01211], and [DB00916], for example.[A177271, F4498] Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [DB00338], [DB00213], [DB00448], [DB05351], and [DB01129]. Esomeprazole is the s-isomer of [DB00338], which is a racemate of the S- and R-enantiomer. Esomeprazole has been shown to inhibit acid secretion to a similar extent as [DB00338], without any significant differences between the two compounds _in vitro_. 

Esomeprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of esomeprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, esomeprazole''s duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]

PPIs such as esomeprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as esomeprazole has been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients such as iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]

Rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as esomeprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion.[A177574] Esomeprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing to prevent this rebound effect.','["A02BD06", "A02BC05", "M01AE52"]','[]'),(10326,'Septazole forte 800/160mg 20 tab.','سيبتازول فورت 20 قرص','18','','Antibiotic','Sulphamethoxazole+trimethoprim','Alexandria','Tab','أقراص','160mg','2','مضاد حيوي . أدوية السلفا','','','',2774,'2022-12-08',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10327,'Aaa','ششش','4','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',746,'2023-05-04',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10329,'Septocid antiseptic solution 120 ml','سيبتوسيد محلول مطهر 120مل','4','','Antiseptic','Cetrimide+dichloroxylenol','Cid','Solution','محلول','120 ml','1','','','6221043012025','',956,'2022-12-08',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10332,'Aaa','ششش','10','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',818,'2022-12-08',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10333,'Septoral gargle 120 ml','سيبتورال مضمضة 120مل','4','','Oral care','Cetrimide+lidocaine','Cid','Gargle','غرغرة','120 ml','1','','is used to obtain a local anaesthesia of the lining of the inside of the mouth (buccal mucosa). it contains two active ingredients: ï- lidocaine a local anaesthetic which numbs the painful area temporarily ï- cetrimide an antiseptic which kills any micro?','6221043012117','',1028,'2022-12-08',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10334,'Septrin d.s 10 coated tab.','سبترين دي اس اقراص مضاعف قوة 10 قرص','28','18','Antibiotic','Sulphamethoxazole+trimethoprim','Glaxo smithkline','Tab','أقراص','','1','مضاد حيوي من عائلة السلفا','','6091403220397','',15174,'2024-12-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10335,'Septrin paediatric 200/40 susp. 120ml','سبترين معلق للاطفال 120 مل','32','16','Antibiotic','Sulphamethoxazole+trimethoprim','Glaxo smithkline','Susp','معلق','120ml','1','مضاد حيوي','','6091403220403','',4420,'2024-12-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10337,'Seralone -e 30 capsules','سيرالون - اي 30 كبسولة','26','','Liver support','Milk thistle+vitamin e','Hochster pharmaceutical industries','Capsule','كبسولة','','3','','','6224007751053','',699,'2022-12-08',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10339,'Hanza 2 in 1 correcting eye cream 30 gm','هانزا 2 في 1 كريم تصحيح لمحيط العين 30 جم','130','','','','Hanza pharma','Cream','كريم','30 gm','1','','','','',620,'2022-08-16',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10340,'Lodi-rose whitening cream 100gram','لودي روز كريم تبييض وتفتيح البشرة 100 جم','195','','Whitening cream','Alpha-arbutin+vit e+vit c+vit a+licorice extract+kojic acid+vit b3+glycerin+caviar extract+bearberry extract+hyaluronic acid+collagen+titanuim dioxide+zinc oxide+shea butter+sodium hydroxide+caffeine','Optavit pharma','Cream','كريم','','1','','','','',693,'2022-08-16',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10341,'Grantochizan 400 mg 20 caps','جرانتوشيزان 400مجم 20 كبسولة','135','','Dietary supplement','Chromium+chitosan','Grand egypt pharma','Cap','كبسولة','400 mg','2','','','','',2419,'2022-08-16',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10342,'Eucal herbal oil 75 ml','يوكال هيربال اويل 75 مل','45','','Massage','Eucalyptus globulus+gaultheria procumbens+salvia officinalis+cassia angustifolia+colchicum+centaureu','El-dawlia co. > el-sisi international co.','Oil','زيت','75 ml','1','','','','',838,'2022-08-16',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10343,'Enov nutibutter 200gm 10 sachets','اينوف نوتيباتر 200 جم 10 اكياس','149','112','Multivitamin','Vitamins(a+d3+e+c+b1+b2+b6+b12)+folic acid+niacin+iodine+selenium+iron+copper+zinc','Zeta pharm','Sachet','أكياس','200gm','1','','','','',863,'2023-08-28',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10344,'Aaa','ششش','140','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',783,'2022-08-17',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10345,'Seretide diskus 250/50mcg 28 doses','سيريتايد ديسكس 250/50مكجم 28 جرعة','257','184','Bronchodilator.glucocorticoid steroid and long-acting b2 agonist','Fluticasone+salmeterol','Glaxo smithkline > modern pharma','Unknown','غير محدد','50mcg','1','','about fluticasone synthetic topical glucocorticoid anti inflammatory and antipruritic in corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses;
