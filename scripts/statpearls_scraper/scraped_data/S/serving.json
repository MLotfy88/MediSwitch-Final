These team members can also collaborate to help patients obtain insurance coverage (see\nTable 1\n).\nCore team members include:\n\nPrimary care clinicians and specialists\nRegistered dietitians with obesity management expertise\nBehavioral health professionals\nPsychologists and social workers specializing in obesity-related psychological support\nExercise physiologists\nPharmacists with medication management expertise\nBariatric surgery teams, when appropriate\n\nTable\nTable 1. Insurance Coverage Strategies for Obesity Treatments.\n\nOperational Protocols and Clinical Workflows\n\nThe Obesity Medicine Association's \"ADAPT\" framework offers a structured approach to comprehensive obesity care, encompassing assessment, diagnosis, adiposity-based chronic disease staging, plan development, and treatment implementation.\n[2]\nThis framework ensures comprehensive care delivery while maintaining efficiency across all care modalities, including in-person and telehealth settings. Workflow components include:\n\nPrevisit preparation: Medical history review, weight trend analysis\nAssessment phase: Comprehensive obesity evaluation using standardized tools\nTreatment planning: Individualized, multimodal approach selection\nFollow-up protocols: Regular monitoring with defined intervals\nOutcome tracking: Quality measures including obesity diagnosis documentation, weight change over time, and patient-reported outcomes\n[3]\n\nPause and Reflect\n\nTable\nDr Johnson recently joined a busy internal medicine practice and noticed that several patients with obesity seem uncomfortable during visits, often avoiding follow-up appointments. She aims to optimize the practice environment and workflows to\n(more...)\n\nWeight Bias and Stigma Reduction\n\nWeight stigma represents negative attitudes, beliefs, and stereotypes that society holds toward people who are overweight and people with obesity, and this bias occurs frequently in healthcare settings.\n[4]\n[5]\nThis stigma can lead to suboptimal care, delayed diagnoses, unhealthy behaviors, and exacerbate chronic health conditions. Nearly 70% of people who are overweight report feeling stigmatized by healthcare professionals.\n[6]\nClinicians must actively address these biases to ensure the delivery of equitable care.\n\nNonstigmatizing communication principles\n\nClinicians can reduce stigma by adopting patient-centered communication, motivational interviewing, and zero-tolerance policies against discriminatory practices, as emphasized in guidelines for managing obesity bias. Effective communication acknowledges the complex, multifactorial nature of obesity while maintaining respect for patient autonomy.\n[7]\nClinicians may inadvertently perpetuate stereotypes by making assumptions about a patient's lifestyle, likely compliance with treatment, or overall health behaviors, often attributing all medical issues to obesity rather than addressing patients' comprehensive healthcare needs.\n[6]\nNonstigmatizing communication strategies include:\n\nConsistently use \"people-first\" language.\nAvoid assumptions about lifestyle behaviors.\nFocus on health outcomes rather than weight alone.\nAcknowledge the whole person beyond their weight status.\n\nThe following \"people-first\" language is recommended:\n\nDO use\n\"Person with obesity\" or \"person living with obesity\"\n\"Higher weight\" or \"larger body size\"\n\"Weight management\" or \"health improvement\"\n\"Excess weight\" (when clinically relevant)\nDO NOT use\n\"Obese person\" or \"fat patient\"\n\"Normal weight\" (implies abnormal for others)\n\"Obesity epidemic\" or \"war on obesity\"\n\"Morbidly obese\" (use \"class III obesity\")\nClinical language\nReplace blame-focused terms with health-focused alternatives. Example: Instead of  \"This patient is noncompliant with diet and exercise,\" use \"This patient faces barriers to consistent lifestyle changes and may benefit from additional support and tailored strategies.\"\nEmphasize behavior change rather than willpower. Example: \"Managing weight isn't about willpower alone—it's about making small, realistic changes in daily habits with the proper support. Together, we'll focus on healthy routines and strategies that fit your life, rather than just asking you to rely on willpower.\"\nAcknowledge biological and environmental factors. Example: \"Obesity is not just about your choices—it's influenced by biology, metabolism, and your environment, and we will work with you to address all of those factors.\"\n\nIdentifying and addressing implicit bias\n\nHealthcare professionals frequently exhibit weight bias, and substantial evidence indicates that these attitudes can influence their perceptions, judgments, interactions, and clinical decision-making regarding patients with obesity.\n[8]\nSelf-assessment and ongoing education are crucial for reducing bias. Regular self-reflection helps healthcare practitioners recognize and address their biases (see\nTable 2\n).\n[9]\nPositive contact with patients or peers with obesity during medical training reduces implicit and explicit weight bias through increased empathy.\n\nTable\nTable 2. Implicit Bias Assessments.\n\nSelf-assessment questions include:\n\nDo I attribute health problems primarily to weight?\nAm I making assumptions about patient motivation?\nDo I spend equal time with patients regardless of weight?\nAm I using evidence-based treatments for all patients?\n\nPause and Reflect\n\nTable\nNurse practitioner Lisa overhears a colleague comment about a patient: \"If she just tried harder, she wouldn't be so heavy.\" Later, Lisa notices that she herself spends less time with patients with obesity and realizes she may have unconscious biases\n(more...)\n\nHealth System Advocacy\n\nEducating healthcare teams\n\nMedical training must address weight bias, educating healthcare professionals about its perpetuation and the potentially harmful effects on patients.\n[9]\nSystem-wide education initiatives create sustainable change in obesity care delivery.\n[10]\nThe following educational topics should be prioritized:\n\nObesity as a chronic disease requiring medical treatment\nPhysiological and genetic factors influencing weight regulation\nEvidence-based treatment approaches across the lifespan\nThe impact of weight stigma on patient outcomes\n\nKey educational messages to convey to healthcare teams:\n\nPhysiological understanding\nObesity involves complex hormonal and metabolic dysregulation.\nBody weight regulation is not entirely under volitional control; biological, genetic, and environmental factors critically contribute to it.\nWeight regain after loss represents normal physiological adaptation.\nTreatment approach\nMultimodal treatment produces superior outcomes.\nApproximately 5% to 10% weight loss provides clinically significant health benefits.\nLong-term management requires ongoing support and monitoring.\nCommunication excellence\nPatient-centered care improves treatment engagement.\nMotivational interviewing enhances behavior change outcomes.\nRespectful communication reduces healthcare avoidance.\n\nTraining staff and trainees\n\nComprehensive training programs must address knowledge gaps, skill development, and attitude change (see\nTable 3\n). Increased education, causal information about obesity, empathy-evoking interventions, weight-inclusive approaches, and mixed methodologies promise to reduce stigma.\n\nTable\nTable 3. Common Knowledge Gaps Among Clinicians.\n\nAdvocating for System-Wide Policy Changes\n\nHealthcare systems require policy-level changes to support comprehensive care for obesity.\n[11]\nThese include coverage decisions, quality metrics, and care delivery models recognizing obesity as a chronic disease requiring ongoing management. Policy advocacy areas may consist of:\n\nInsurance coverage expansion for evidence-based treatments\nQuality metrics, including obesity care outcomes\nClinician education requirements and competency standards\nCare coordination models that integrate obesity management\nStandardizing obesity treatment in medical education curricula\n\nPublic awareness and policy advocacy\n\nEffective community education addresses misconceptions while promoting evidence-based understanding of obesity as a chronic disease. Challenging widespread, deeply rooted beliefs requires a new public narrative of obesity that is coherent with modern scientific knowledge. Community educational approaches include:\n\nPublic health campaigns emphasizing health rather than appearance\nCommunity partnerships with schools, workplaces, and organizations\nMedia engagement to improve obesity portrayals\nPatient and family education programs\n\nThe following are practical public messaging principles:\n\nScience-based messaging\nEmphasize biological and environmental factors.\nHighlight treatment effectiveness and safety.\nAcknowledge complexity while maintaining hope.\nUse inclusive, respectful language consistently.\nAvoid stigmatizing content\nDo not use shame-based motivational approaches.\nAvoid before/after imagery that suggests simple solutions.\nDo not reinforce stereotypes about people with obesity.\nEliminate language that implies moral failure.\n\nEmployer engagement approaches\n\nWorkplace wellness programs provide opportunities for comprehensive obesity prevention and treatment. Evidence-based programs can improve employee health outcomes while creating weight-inclusive workplaces that promote destigmatizing work cultures (see\nTable 4\n). Employer wellness program partnership elements can include:\n\nComprehensive health screenings, including obesity assessment\nAccess to evidence-based treatment programs\nEnvironmental modifications supporting healthy behaviors\nCoverage advocacy for obesity treatments\nImplementation of weight-inclusive workplace policies\n\nTable\nTable 4. Public Health Intervention Effectiveness Evidence.\n\nPause and Reflect\n\nTable\nDr Anderson serves as the medical director for a large healthcare system and wants to advocate for better obesity care policies. She recently attended a community health fair where she encountered numerous misconceptions about obesity and weight management\n(more...)"
