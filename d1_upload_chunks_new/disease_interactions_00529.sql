Therapy with ACE inhibitors should be administered cautiously in patients with preexisting renal dysfunction, particularly those with renovascular disease.  Patients with moderate to severe renal impairment usually require lower or less frequent doses and smaller increments in dose.  In addition, a dosage reduction or discontinuation of any concomitantly administered diuretics may be helpful.  Fosinopril probably does not require dosage adjustments unless hepatic function is also significantly impaired.  
In patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney, ACE inhibitors may reduce renal perfusion to a critically low level.  Renal function should be monitored closely for the first few weeks of therapy.', '2', '', 'DDInter', 0);
