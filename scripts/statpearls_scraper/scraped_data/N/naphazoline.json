    "indications": "Neuromuscular disorders and allergies to botulinum toxin constituents are the only described contraindications to botulinum toxin injections.\n[8]",
    "clinical_significance": "Among patients with laryngeal dystonia, botulinum toxin injections decrease the mean Voice Handicap Index (VHI) score by 9.6%.\n[1]\nImprovement in symptoms after successful injection of target muscles helps to confirm the diagnosis of ADSD and ABSD, as well as other laryngeal pathologies. Once the diagnosis is ascertained, the patient can explore options for definitive treatment, which may include intermittent botulinum toxin injections vs. definite procedures.\n\nPatients with vocal process granuloma treated with botulinum toxin to the thyroarytenoid have had success rates between 77% to 100%; however, there is a high prevalence of breathiness after injection. Interarytenoid (IA) injections alone have shown promising results, with comparable efficacy to thyroarytenoid injections and a lower prevalence of breathiness. Fink et al. reported complete regression in 55 percent of patients. Hamden et al. report that only 50% of their 8 patients reported breathiness after IA injection.\n[12]\n\nIn treating cricopharyngeal muscle dysfunction, botulinum toxin to the CP muscle is both diagnostic and therapeutic. In a study by Schneider et al., 5 of 7 patients with mild to severe dysphagia were effectively treated with botulinum toxin, with a clinically significant reduction in dysphagia.\n[7]"
