    "indications": "Euphorbiaceae is a large family of flowering plants found worldwide and encompasses over 8,000 species. Also known as the spurge family, it is divided into multiple genera. Plants belonging to the genus Euphorbia have been used in folk medicine to treat various conditions throughout ancient history.  Species such as\nEuphorbia tirucalli\n(pencil cactus),\nEuphorbia milii\n(crown of thorns), and\nEuphorbia pulcherrima\n(Poinsettia) are commonly used as decorative houseplants and in landscaping. Many\nEuphorbia\nspecies secrete a white, milky sap, called latex, that can cause harmful effects through dermal or mucous membrane contact, particularly ocular exposure.\n\nEuphorbia tirucalli\n, also commonly referred to as the pencil cactus, milk bush, and firestick plant grows as a shrub or small tree without leaves, has succulent-like branches, and may grow up to 12 meters high.\nEuphorbia tirucalli\nproduces an abundant amount of latex when pieces of the plant are broken or damaged. Although native to Africa, it is used extensively in the southern United States for ornamental purposes. Because of its proximity to humans, medical providers in regions where the plant is widespread must be aware of its toxicity. The Texas Poison Center Network reported 678\nEuphorbia\ntirucalli exposures from 2000 to 2018, but it is likely that many exposures likely go unreported.\n[1]\nEuphorbia myrsinites\n,\nEuphorbia marginata\n,\nEuphorbia peplus\n, and\nEuphorbia trigona\nalso cause irritant effects after contact with their latex.\n[2]\n\nDermal contact generally causes mild, irritant contact dermatitis, whereas ocular exposure to\nEuphorbia\nlatex is a medical emergency that may lead to blindness without proper treatment. Ingestion of the latex is rare and usually only causes mild symptoms related to irritation of the oral cavity, esophagus, and stomach.",
    "mechanism": "The toxicity of\nEuphorbia\nlatex has not been fully elucidated, but it is believed to exert its poisonous effects through pH-mediated necrosis and pro-inflammatory, immune-mediated mechanisms.\n[2]\n\nThe latex contains alkaloids and has been described as caustic.\n[3]\nDermal exposure causes irritant contact dermatitis that may present similarly to chemical burns. Ocular exposure to\nEuphorbia\nlatex has been associated with elevated ocular pH and causes a chemical injury to the cornea and conjunctiva.\n[4]\n[5]\n\nDiterpenoid substances found in\nEuphorbia\nlatex are believed to play a role in its cytotoxicity.\n[3]\nIngenols, a type of diterpene ester, has been isolated from the latex of various\nEuphorbia\nspecies and demonstrate cytotoxic and pro-inflammatory effects.",
    "monitoring": "After a confirmed or suspected exposure to\nEuphorbia\nlatex has occurred, the priority is decontamination to prevent further injury. Wash the skin thoroughly with soap and water. Remove contact lenses if present. Eyes should be irrigated copiously with water or saline for a minimum of 30 minutes.\n[12]\nIf ocular pH is elevated, continue irrigation until pH normalizes to approximately 7.\n\nLaboratory and imaging studies are not required for isolated dermal or ocular exposures and are unlikely to reveal significant abnormalities. In\nEuphorbia\nlatex ingestion with systemic symptoms such as prolonged vomiting or severe abdominal pain, it may be prudent to obtain serum chemistries to evaluate electrolytes and thoracic or abdominal imaging to evaluate for concomitant abnormalities. These events are rare, and studies should be tailored to the clinical presentation based on provider judgment.\n\nIf there is a concern regarding intentional ingestion, then recommend screening for co-ingestions including acetaminophen and salicylates in addition to routine studies such as the electrocardiogram. If the type of plant ingested is unknown, consider screening for cardiac glycoside ingestion with a serum digoxin level, as many plants contain cardiac glycosides that will cross-react with the digoxin assay. The digoxin level should only be used qualitatively and not quantitatively in cases of cardiac glycoside-containing plant ingestions.\n\nContact poison control if there are questions regarding the diagnosis, management, or in the rare event of severe toxicity.",
    "administration": "Treatment of symptoms related to\nEuphorbia\nlatex exposure is mainly supportive; there is no known antidote to\nEuphorbia\nlatex.\n\nFor dermal exposures, oral antihistamines and analgesics may be used for pruritis and pain, respectively. Over-the-counter acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are likely adequate to control pain in most cases. Topical corticosteroids may ease local pruritis and inflammation; however, they also have the potential to delay healing.\n[2]\nThere is no consensus on whether these should be used after\nEuphorbia\nlatex exposure, although they remain a standard treatment for most causes of irritant contact dermatitis.\n\nAfter ocular exposure, ensure the patient has undergone adequate irrigation of the involved eye(s) and that the ocular pH is approximately 7. The treatment of corneal epithelial defects, keratouveitis, elevated IOP, and other ocular findings are not specific to\nEuphorbia\nlatex exposure. Topical anesthetics such as ophthalmic tetracaine drops may be used for analgesia during evaluation but are not recommended long term and generally should not be prescribed on an outpatient basis due to the risk of corneal complications with prolonged use.\n[13]\n\nArtificial tears, oral NSAIDs, and acetaminophen may help provide pain relief for ocular symptoms. If a corneal epithelial defect is present, topical antibiotics are recommended to help prevent secondary bacterial infections. If the patient wears contact lenses, consider an antibiotic with\nPseudomonas\ncoverage such as ophthalmic ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin. Topical corticosteroids and cycloplegics may be indicated for cases of keratouveitis, and IOP-lowering medications may be used in cases of elevated IOP.\n[9]\n\nSome recommend treatment with topical corticosteroids if the patient presents within 24 hours of exposure; however, others have reported good outcomes without steroid application.\n[9]\n[14]\n[5]\nIf a hypopyon is present or if a bacterial infection is suspected, topical corticosteroids should be avoided. If the patient is presenting to a primary care clinic, urgent care, or emergency room, it is recommended to obtain an ophthalmology consultation. If urgent ophthalmology consultation is not available, patients should be referred to an ophthalmologist for a close follow-up to ensure proper corneal healing and monitor for complications.\n\nEuphorbia tirucalli\ningestions usually only cause mild symptoms, and treatment is supportive.\n[1]\nCold fluids, ice, or ice cream may alleviate irritated oral mucosa, and viscous lidocaine may be considered for more severe cases. It is uncertain whether activated charcoal will help neutralize or prevent absorption of\nEuphorbia\nsap. However, it may be reasonable to administer in high plant ingestion cases that present within 1 hour, as long as the patient is otherwise an appropriate candidate for activated charcoal administration.\n[15]\n\nAnything that may induce vomiting should be avoided as this may re-expose and further damage the esophageal mucosa to the toxic latex. Gastric lavage is unnecessary for minor ingestions and may not effectively remove large plant particles if present. In the rare event of significant volume ingestion of\nEuphorbia\nplant material or isolated latex, whole bowel irrigation can be considered to expedite removing the toxin.\n[15]\nSupportive treatment with antiemetics and proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) is appropriate for mild to moderate gastroenteritis symptoms.",
    "adverse_effects": "Complications after exposure to\nEuphorbia\nlatex are uncommon, but severe outcomes including blindness have been reported. Complications are uncommon following dermal exposure, but the affected areas are at risk for secondary bacterial infection. Patients with corneal epithelial defects are at increased risk for developing bacterial infections of the eye. Without treatment, corneal scarring, anterior staphyloma, corneal neovascularization, and blindness may result.\n[7]\n[18]"
