    "clinical_significance": "ERAS pathways have immense clinical significance, both to the patient and the healthcare system as a whole. Meta-analysis has shown that ERAS protocols have decreased the average hospital length of stay by 2.3 days.\n[19]\nERAS protocols have also demonstrated effectiveness in reducing stress induced by surgery and preserving patients' physiologic baseline throughout the perioperative process. Compared to patients who have undergone traditional care, patients who have gone through ERAS protocols had lower levels of inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein. This has significant clinical implications in that patients are more satisfied with their level of care, are spending fewer days postoperatively in the hospital, and there is a reduced number of postoperative complications across the many surgical subspecialties. The ERAS system has revolutionized the perioperative period by allowing for an earlier return of organ function, reducing the duration of postoperative ileus, and preventing pulmonary complications, thereby improving patient quality of life in the immediate period.\n[2]\nAccording to a study, patients who had undergone the ERAS pathway reported increased satisfaction, quicker resumption of normal activities after surgery, and reduced sick days taken.",
    "monitoring": "The ERAS system, due to its relatively new venture into the healthcare system, requires systemic auditing to improve outcomes continually. Auditing will identify pitfalls in communication, and issues with collaboration between teams, and improve compliance and adherence to ERAS protocols. However, due to the multidisciplinary approach of this pathway and the many medical personnel involved, it can serve as an impediment to implementation. The team members of the ERAS system include physicians, pre-admission testing staff, nurses, dieticians, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and social workers. This entire cohort needs to be familiar with ERAS principles and must be willing to implement them. This requires changing their mindset from the traditional view of postoperative care to one that is evidence-based and collaborative."
