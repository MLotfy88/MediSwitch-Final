    "Overview": {
      "text": "Nasopharyngeal airways are tubular, soft, flexible airway devices\nNPA's provide an open airway through the nasopharynx rather than the oropharynx\nThe widened opening which remains outside the nose gives the device its common moniker \"Nasal trumpet\"\nNPA's are supraglottic by definition and generally do not stimulate the gag reflex when placed\nNPA are not contraindicated in the conscious or semi-conscious patient whose gag reflex is intact\nOxygen therapy and/or pressurized respiratory therapies by nasal cannula, simple masks, non-rebreather masks, CPAP, and BiPAP may be used with an NPA in place\nPresence of an NPA in the posterior pharynx may interfere with intubation; they generally should be removed prior to laryngoscopy",
