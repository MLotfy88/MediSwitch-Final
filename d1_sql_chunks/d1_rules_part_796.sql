Some authorities recommend avoiding coadministration of pralsetinib with CYP450 2C8, 2C9, 3A4, and/or 3A5 substrates for which minimal concentration changes may lead to therapeutic failure or serious toxicities.  If coadministration is required, dosage adjustments as well as clinical and laboratory monitoring may be appropriate whenever pralsetinib is added to or withdrawn from therapy.  The prescribing information for concomitant medications should be consulted to assess the benefits versus risks of coadministration and for any dosage adjustments that may be required.', 'Metabolism', NULL, NULL, 'Moderate', NULL, 'DDInter', 'pharmacodynamic', 1767317477);
