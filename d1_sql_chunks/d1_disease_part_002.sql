A "ceiling effect" has been noted for these agents, and increasing doses do not produce proportional or further respiratory depression.  However, the duration of effect is prolonged.  At therapeutic analgesic dosages, the respiratory effects are usually not clinically important except in patients with preexisting pulmonary impairment.  Therapy with opiate partial agonists should be avoided or administered with extreme caution and initiated at reduced dosages in patients with severe CNS or respiratory depression; acute alcohol intoxication; sleep apnea; hypoxia, anoxia, or hypercapnia; upper airway obstruction; chronic pulmonary insufficiency; a limited ventilatory reserve; or other respiratory disorders.  In the presence of excessive respiratory secretions, the use of opiate partial agonists may also be problematic because they decrease ciliary activity and reduce the cough reflex.  Caution is also advised in patients who may be at increased risk for respiratory depression, such as comatose patients or those with head injury, intracranial lesions, or intracranial hypertension.  Clinical monitoring of pulmonary function is recommended, and equipment for resuscitation should be immediately available if parenteral routes are used.  Naloxone may be administered to reverse clinically significant respiratory depression.  However, in the case of buprenorphine, naloxone may not be effective due to buprenorphine''s slow rate of dissociation from mu receptors.', '3', 'DDInter', 0);

Imipramine appears to have the greatest propensity to induce these effects, while secondary amines such as nortriptyline may do so less frequently.  Tolerance to the hypotensive effects often develops after a few doses to a few weeks.  Rarely, collapse and sudden death have occurred secondary to severe hypotension.  Other reported adverse cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmias, heart block, hypertension, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, myocardial infarction, strokes, congestive heart failure, and ECG abnormalities such as PR and QT interval prolongation.  Therapy with TCAs should be avoided during the acute recovery phase following myocardial infarction, and should be administered only with extreme caution in patients with hyperthyroidism, a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or a predisposition to hypotension.  Close monitoring of cardiovascular status, including ECG changes, is recommended at all dosages.  Many of the newer antidepressants, including bupropion and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are considerably less or minimally cardiotoxic and may be appropriate alternatives.', '3', 'DDInter', 0);
