    "indications": "Dental caries is a prevalent chronic disease. If left untreated, caries may progress to tooth destruction and exodontia. Dental caries is a complex multifactorial disease of individual, biological, behavioral, and environmental factors.\n[1]\nThe clinical sign of dental carious is a lesion of varying severity, ranging from opacity in the enamel to frank cavitation exposing dentin. Accurately diagnosing dental caries promotes effective treatment planning, prevents disease progression, and supports optimal patient outcomes.\n\nVarious classification methods for dental carious lesions have been developed, each with advantages and limitations. Newer classification systems, like the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS) and the American Dental Association Caries Classification System (ADA CCS), have evolved from the traditional Black classification to include the current understanding of the carious process, maximize healthy tooth surfaces, and prevent extension of the carious lesion."
