Theoretically, coadministration with other agents that can prolong the QT interval may result in additive effects and increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias including torsade de pointes and sudden death. In addition, the extent of drug-induced QT prolongation is dependent on the particular drug(s) involved and dosage(s) of the drug(s).', 'DDInter', 'The benefits of androgen deprivation therapy should be carefully assessed against the potential risk in patients receiving other drugs known to prolong the QT interval.
