    "indications": "Ibuprofen is contraindicated for patients with a known history of hypersensitivity or allergic reactions to the drug itself, other NSAIDs, or aspirin. Numerous case studies have detailed ibuprofen as a disease precipitant.\n[58]\n[59]\nNSAIDs are among the medications most frequently associated with hypersensitivity reactions in adult and pediatric patients. These patients are typically diagnosed with urticaria or angioedema caused by cross-intolerance to other drug classes, particularly quinolones and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.\n[66]\n\nNSAID-induced hypersensitivity reactions in pediatric patients exhibit a similar prevalence to adult reactions but differ in clinical phenotype. Oral provocation testing remains the gold standard for diagnosing NSAID hypersensitivity, and safe alternatives for cross-intolerant children and adolescents include tolmetin, etoricoxib, paracetamol, and nimesulide.\n[67]\n\nIbuprofen lysine IV formulation is contraindicated for preterm neonates with congenital heart disease requiring PDA patency, active bleeding, thrombocytopenia, renal impairment, coagulation defects, and documented or suspected necrotizing enterocolitis. Outside of these scenarios, ibuprofen is not associated with an increased risk of adverse reactions when administered to infants younger than 6 months and remains indicated for pediatric patients without these contraindications.\n[66]\n\nIn Canada, ibuprofen's drug labels list additional contraindications, including active GI or cerebrovascular bleeding, uncontrolled heart failure, lupus, renal impairment, and hepatic impairment or disease.\n\nBox Warnings\n\nCardiovascular thrombotic events:\nIbuprofen increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke.\nCoronary artery bypass:\nIbuprofen administration is not advised during the perioperative period for patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\n[68]\nGastrointestinal adverse events:\nNSAIDs such as ibuprofen increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, including bleeding, perforation, and ulceration. This risk is further elevated in older patients and those with pre-existing gastrointestinal conditions; these patients already have suppressed levels of protective prostaglandins in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nWarning and Precautions\n\nIbuprofen and ibuprofen lysine are both available for parenteral use. Ibuprofen lysine is indicated specifically for closing patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in premature infants; regular ibuprofen is not an appropriate substitute.\nLike many widely used medications, there is increasing concern about the presence of ibuprofen in the environment and the long-term effects of environmental ibuprofen exposure. Recent studies have explored potential bioremediation methods of ibuprofen in the atmosphere via bacterial strains, mineral particles, and solar radiation. The toxicity of ibuprofen's metabolites is minimal compared to ibuprofen's toxicity. Furthermore, studies have also demonstrated ibuprofen's low toxicity in tested organisms and no observable mutagenic activity of the drug. Concerns persist regarding the potential indirect effects of ibuprofen on prostaglandin-regulated processes in the environment, including ovulation, menstruation, inflammation, and pain.\n[69]\n[70]",
    "mechanism": "The primary mechanism of ibuprofen involves inhibiting prostaglandin precursors. After a physiological or pathological stimulus, membrane phospholipids release arachidonic acid through the actions of the enzyme phospholipase A2. Arachidonic acid is fed into 1 of 3 enzymatic pathways: cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), and cytochrome P450 (CYP450). The cyclooxygenase pathway converts arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, prostacyclins, and thromboxanes. The lipoxygenase pathway yields hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), leukotrienes, and lipoxins. Lastly, the cytochrome P450 pathway converts arachidonic acid to HETEs and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EET).\n[24]\n\nThese pathways all create products called eicosanoids. These molecules are involved in the intercellular and intracellular signaling processes of various physiological processes, including smooth muscle tone regulation, vascular permeability, transporter proteins, platelet aggregation, and cell proliferation. Like cyclooxygenase pathway products, eicosanoids also involve autoimmunity, angiogenesis, atopy, inflammation, and cancer.\n[29]\n\nThe cyclooxygenase pathway is significantly involved in the indicated uses of ibuprofen. The COX pathway yields 3 distinct isoforms: COX-1 (PGH synthase), COX-2, and COX-3. COX-1 is a constitutionally expressed isoform, with levels relatively stable in response to most physiologic or pathologic stimuli. In contrast, COX-2 expression is highly inducible by mitogenic and inflammatory stimuli. The more well-known stimuli include transforming growth factors, fibroblast growth factors, vascular endothelial growth factors, and tumor necrosis factors. The function of the COX-3 isoform remains unknown and is currently under study.\n[24]\n[30]\nAcetaminophen is known to inhibit the activity of COX-3.\n[31]\n[24]\n\nInhibition of the COX-1 and COX-2 pathways reduces the expression of prostaglandin precursors; this, in turn, lessens the degree of cellular response to pathologic or physiologic stimuli. Through this mechanism, non-selective NSAIDs such as ibuprofen derive their analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory properties.\n[24]\nFor ibuprofen specifically, COX-1 is inhibited approximately 2.5 times more strongly than COX-2, suggesting the need for research on the efficacy of COX-2 selective inhibitors in treating conditions usually treated with ibuprofen.\n[19]\n\nAside from its well-known roles in inflammation, COX-2 is also constitutively expressed during early carcinogenesis.\n[14]\nElevated levels of COX-2 are associated with various human cancers, including breast, colorectal, esophageal, lung, and pancreatic.\n[24]\nThe current findings on COX-2 and its various effects suggest that the anticancer effects of NSAIDs occur due to COX-2 inhibition. The precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains a topic of ongoing research. Other pathways may be involved in NSAIDs' anticancer and antitumor effects, as NSAIDs reduce cell survival in overexpressed and deficient COX-2 malignant cells.\n[32]\n\nThe potential involvement of NSAIDs in carcinogenesis has been studied for the other 2 enzymatic pathways, but the information is still limited. LOX isoforms, particularly 5-LOX, 12-LOX, and 15-LOX, have been discussed as potential contributors to tumor development and growth. 5-LOX is normally expressed only in immune cells and has been implicated in the early stages of colon cancer, carcinogenesis in oral cavity tissue, and the expression of chronic myeloid leukemia.\n[33]\n[34]\n[35]\n12-LOX has proangiogenic functions, as it controls G1/S-phase arrest via regulation of Nf-kB and inhibition of Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinases.\n[4]\n15-LOX isoforms promote cell senescence and suppress cell cycle progression.\n[36]\n\nPharmacokinetics\n\nAbsorption:\nIbuprofen is absorbed rapidly and completely after oral administration. However, food intake can affect absorption due to changes in gastric pH, emptying, and motility. When taken with food, ibuprofen's maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) is reduced by 30%–50%, and the time to reach maximum concentration (Tmax) is delayed by 30–60 minutes.\n\nDistribution:\nIbuprofen is highly bound to plasma proteins, with approximately 99% bound once absorbed.\n\nMetabolism:\nIbuprofen is primarily metabolized into hydroxylated and carboxylated compounds, which are the major forms of its metabolites. CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 are the primary CYP enzymes responsible for ibuprofen clearance.\n[37]\n[38]\n\nElimination:\nIbuprofen is primarily excreted through urine as metabolites and conjugates. Approximately 1% of the original drug is excreted unchanged.\n[39]",
    "administration": "Available Dosage Forms and Strengths\n\nIbuprofen is available over-the-counter in most countries. Typical formulations include oral capsules, oral suspension, oral tablets, chewable tablets, intravenous solutions, topical gels, and combination kits. Ibuprofen with lysine is a commonly used intravenous formulation. Ibuprofen should not be administered simultaneously with total parenteral nutrition. However, it may be administered through the same IV line; total parenteral nutrition should be paused for 15 minutes before and resumed 15 minutes after ibuprofen dosing. Researchers are currently exploring the possibility of simultaneous delivery of ibuprofen with other IV medications or nutrition. A recent study exploring the chemical compatibility of continuous ibuprofen lysine infusion with total parenteral nutrition demonstrated the physical and chemical compatibility of ibuprofen infusion with 2 different total parenteral nutrition formulations in neonates with PDA.\n[40]\nTopical ibuprofen is also currently under study as a more efficient therapy for conditions treated with ibuprofen, such as osteoarthritis and dysmenorrhea.\n[15]\n[41]\n\nAdult Dosage\n\nOral ibuprofen should be consumed with food or milk. Intravenous administration is often preferred in inpatient settings or when oral delivery is unavailable. Infusion should occur over at least 30 minutes for adults and 10 minutes for pediatric patients.\n[6]\n[22]\n\nPain relief:\n200 to 400 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours, with a maximum daily limit of 1200 mg unless otherwise instructed by a physician. Physicians may prescribe higher doses of 400 to 800 mg orally every 6 hours, not to exceed 3200 mg daily.\n[42]\n\nJoint inflammation:\n1800 to 2400 mg daily for rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis.\n[37]\n\nPericarditis:\nThe American College of Cardiology guidelines recommend 600 to 800 mg of ibuprofen every 8 hours to treat acute pericarditis.\n[21]\n\nSpecific Patient Populations\n\nHepatic impairment:\nThe product labeling does not include any information regarding dosage modifications. However, drug-induced liver injury (DILI), including steatohepatitis, is associated with NSAID administration. Ibuprofen should be used with caution for patients with preexisting liver disease.\n[43]\n\nRenal impairment:\nStable patients with stage 1 or 2 CKD without significant risk factors may be monitored per standard practice. For patients with stage 3 CKD and minimal risk factors, short-term NSAID use for pain management is acceptable for up to 5 days. Routine laboratory testing and follow-up within 2 to 3 weeks constitute appropriate monitoring. Long-term NSAID use in these patients poses higher risks due to prolonged exposure and the potential for increased toxicity. Therefore, prolonged therapy may be considered with patient education on avoiding high-risk conditions and close medical follow-up. Short-acting NSAIDs are preferred, and dosing intervals should be adjusted for CKD-related reduced drug elimination. NSAIDs should be avoided for patients with conditions dependent on prostaglandin-mediated renal blood flow, such as true extracellular volume depletion, cirrhosis, CHF, or nephrotic syndrome.\n[44]\n\nThe KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) 2012 guidelines recommend avoiding NSAIDs for patients with a GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m². Prolonged therapy with NSAIDs is also not recommended for patients with a GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m². The KDIGO 2024 guidelines emphasize that patients with CKD (particularly those in stages G3-G5) are more susceptible to the nephrotoxic effects of medications, including ibuprofen. When considering these drugs, clinicians should carefully assess the balance between their therapeutic benefits and potential renal risks. NSAIDS can cause interstitial nephritis, analgesic nephropathy, and hyperkalemia. Despite their nephrotoxic potential, NSAIDs may administered to patients with CKD if the anticipated benefits outweigh the potential harm.\n[45]\n\nPregnancy considerations:\nIn 2020, the FDA cautioned that using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) after 20 weeks of pregnancy could lead to fetal renal dysfunction, causing oligohydramnios and potentially neonatal renal impairment, limb contractures, and delayed lung development. These effects typically manifest days to weeks after starting NSAID treatment, with rare instances of oligohydramnios appearing within 48 hours. Discontinuing NSAIDs often reverses oligohydramnios. NSAID use from 20 to 30 weeks should be restricted to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. NSAIDs are not recommended after 30 weeks due to the elevated risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid may be required if NSAID treatment exceeds 48 hours.\n[46]\n\nBreastfeeding considerations:\nIbuprofen is preferred for nursing mothers due to its low levels in breast milk, short half-life, and safe use in infants at higher doses than those present in breast milk. The mean weight-adjusted percentage of the maternal dosage (Relative Infant Dosage [RID]) is estimated to be <0.38%. However, the RID varies with the time postpartum and the milk protein content. During the colostral phase, when milk protein is highest, the RID reaches 0.6%. Fully breastfed infants receive approximately 68 μg/kg daily, equal to 0.2% of the typical pediatric dosing.\n[47]\nOne study indicated that scheduled oral analgesia with 1 g paracetamol (acetaminophen) and 400 mg ibuprofen every 6 hours post-vaginal delivery resulted in higher medication usage and similar pain scores compared to on-demand dosing but increased breastfeeding rates and maternal satisfaction.\n[48]\n\nPediatric patients:\nThe recommended dose of ibuprofen is 5-10 mg/kg orally every 6-8 hours, with a maximum of 400 mg per dose or 40 mg/kg daily.\n[49]\nIntravenous ibuprofen is an effective treatment for patients with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA).\n[50]\n[51]\nIbuprofen lysine is administered in 3 intravenous doses for treating PDA. An initial dose of 10 mg/kg is followed by 2 doses of 5 mg/kg given 24 and 48 hours later. Dosage is determined based on birth weight. If urinary output falls below 0.6 mL/kg/hr at the scheduled time for the second or third dose of ibuprofen, administration should be postponed until laboratory tests confirm normal renal function.\n\nOlder patients\n: According to the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) 2023 guidelines, NSAIDs like ibuprofen should be used long-term only when necessary and in combination with gastroprotective agents (proton pump inhibitor or misoprostol). Short-term use of ibuprofen with corticosteroids, anticoagulants, or antiplatelet agents should be avoided unless alternatives are ineffective and gastroprotection is feasible. High-risk patients, such as those older than 75 or using corticosteroids, anticoagulants, or antiplatelet agents, are more prone to gastrointestinal bleeding or ulcers as a result of NSAID therapy. Proton-pump inhibitors can reduce but not eliminate this risk.\n[52]\nIn patients with an eGFR ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m², the standard dose of ibuprofen is 1600 mg. However, recommendations for dose adjustments based on renal function vary among eGFR equations. The recommended dose is also 1600 mg for patients with an eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m². For patients with an eGFR of 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m², the recommended dose falls to 1200 mg. Ibuprofen is contraindicated for patients with an eGFR ≤29 mL/min/1.73 m². The choice of eGFR equation significantly influences these recommendations; equations such as the Cockcroft-Gault (CG), Berlin Initiative Study (BIS), Full Age Spectrum (FAS), and Larsson-Male (LMR) generally recommend lower doses compared to the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation, which tends to estimate higher renal function. This variability highlights the importance of precise GFR estimation for appropriate ibuprofen dosing to ensure safety and efficacy, particularly in patients with hip fractures and varying degrees of renal impairment.\n[53]",
    "adverse_effects": "Gastrointestinal bleeding is a well-known adverse effect of ibuprofen usage and can lead to gastritis, ulceration, hemorrhage, or perforation. Inhibition of COX isoform production reduces prostaglandin levels, which are involved in gastroprotective mucus secretion.\n[54]\nThis effect is more pronounced with non-selective NSAIDs; selective COX-2 inhibitors are associated with a lower incidence of gastrointestinal complications, which is of particular concern in children. Ibuprofen is more commonly used than other NSAIDs due to its favorable safety profile. Using ibuprofen over-the-counter without medical consultation increases the risk of high dosage levels and short-term interval dosing that may precipitate gastrointestinal complications.\n[55]\n\nReduced renal function is also associated with ibuprofen administration. A recent surveillance study demonstrated the nephrotoxic properties of NSAIDs, including in patients with normal kidney function.\n[56]\n\nDehydration is a common risk factor for ibuprofen-induced renal injury. Various studies have explored the relationship between NSAIDs and kidney function in patients who are predisposed to dehydration, such as children with renal comorbidities or endurance athletes. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving ultramarathon runners showed an increased rate of acute kidney injury in those who took ibuprofen, with a number needed to harm of 5.5.\n[57]\nClinicians must consider a patient's renal function before administering ibuprofen or other NSAIDs.\n\nRashes are also known to occur in patients receiving ibuprofen therapy, usually due to drug hypersensitivity or skin irritation after topical administration. A rash may also be a component of severe reactions to ibuprofen, such as anaphylaxis or drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome. This condition can manifest as skin, liver, and hematologic abnormalities in patients who have recently taken ibuprofen. The etiology of DRESS syndrome is poorly understood; theories involving human herpesvirus-6 or hypersensitivity to toxic metabolites have been postulated.\n[58]\nDRESS syndrome typically occurs in patients taking anticonvulsants, sulfa derivatives, or antimicrobials. Information regarding ibuprofen-induced DRESS syndrome is limited; one case report documented the course of a pediatric patient who presented with DRESS syndrome in 2016. Another report from 2014 described a patient who developed a drug-induced liver injury with multiform exudative erythema after ingesting over-the-counter medication containing ibuprofen for 20 days.\n[59]\n\nNSAID administration is also associated with hypertension. A 1993 cross-sectional study involving older adults revealed NSAID use to be an independent risk factor for developing hypertension in this age group.\n[60]\nResearchers have since begun investigating the effect of anti-inflammatory medications on hypertension development, including the comparative differences between NSAIDs. One retrospective cohort study in 2012 reported mild elevations in systolic blood pressure in patients who took ibuprofen and other NSAIDs compared to patients who received acetaminophen. However, this effect was negligible in patients already taking diuretics or multiple antihypertensives.\n[61]\n\nIntravenous ibuprofen as a treatment for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) causes hyperbilirubinemia and bilirubin displacement due to the high protein binding of the medication.\n[62]\n\nDrug-Drug Interactions\n\nACE inhibitors:\nIbuprofen may reduce the antihypertensive effects of ACE inhibitors. Monitoring is recommended for patients using these medications concurrently.\n\nAspirin:\nIbuprofen can interfere with aspirin's antiplatelet effects, especially if these medications are taken together or if ibuprofen is taken before aspirin. To minimize this interaction, immediate-release low-dose aspirin should be taken at least 2 hours before ibuprofen. Concurrent use is generally not recommended due to increased cardiovascular risks.\n\nDiuretics:\nIbuprofen can diminish the natriuretic effect of diuretics such as furosemide and thiazides, potentially reducing their efficacy. Close monitoring is necessary for patients receiving these medications concurrently, as they are at an increased risk of AKI.\n[63]\n\nLithium:\nIbuprofen can increase plasma lithium levels and reduce renal lithium clearance by inhibiting renal prostaglandin synthesis. When ibuprofen and lithium are administered together, patients should be monitored for signs of lithium toxicity.\n[64]\n\nAnticoagulants:\nIbuprofen increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients receiving warfarin therapy.\n[65]\nPatients should be monitored closely for signs of bleeding when these medications are used together.",
    "monitoring": "Appropriate monitoring should minimize the possibility of common and uncommon adverse effects associated with ibuprofen therapy. Pain relief and gastrointestinal symptoms should be documented during a patient’s clinical evaluation, as they may suggest desensitization to the analgesic effect of ibuprofen or emerging gastritis or GI bleeding. Blood pressure should also be monitored, especially in older adults or patients with hypertension.\n[60]\n[61]\nRenal function monitoring is also recommended, given NSAIDs nephrotoxic effects in at-risk and healthy patients.\n[56]\n[57]\n\nLiver function is not typically monitored in patients receiving ibuprofen. However, documented NSAID-induced liver injury in pediatric patients suggests the need for monitoring in individuals with high-risk factors or at-risk populations. NSAID-induced liver damage occurs less frequently than in patients receiving acetaminophen. However, there is no antidote for liver damage resulting from NSAID use.\n[71]\nIncreasing ibuprofen administration to children suggests the need for further study regarding the effect of NSAIDs on liver function.",
    "toxicity": "Signs and Symptoms of Overdose\n\nIbuprofen's toxic potential is derived from its inhibition of the cyclooxygenase pathway and the subsequent effects on various cellular processes and multiple organ systems. Prostaglandins and thromboxanes help maintain the gastric mucosal layer and renal blood flow; ibuprofen is associated with a mildly elevated risk of adverse gastrointestinal and renal events, even at therapeutic levels. Ibuprofen is the most common NSAID involved in overdose cases; 29% of overdoses are the result of ibuprofen ingestion alone. Patients can also overdose by ingesting ibuprofen combined with other analgesics.\n[72]\nOne study created a risk score for improving the risk-benefit ratio of NSAID administration; this score was accurate in categorizing the one-year risk of significant toxicity among NSAID users.\n[73]\n\nReye syndrome is an increasingly rare presentation, primarily due to international efforts to curb aspirin usage since the 1980s. Restricted aspirin administration to children in the United Kingdom reduced the incidence of Reye syndrome from 100 cases in 1984 to 3 cases in 2000.\n[71]\nNSAIDs damage the mitochondria in hepatocytes, precipitating Reye syndrome.\n[74]\nFurthermore, the mechanism of NSAID-induced liver damage remains largely unknown. Due to the increasing use of ibuprofen in children, the possibility of increased rates of drug-induced liver damage and Reye syndrome should be considered.\n[71]\n\nThe maximum recommended daily dose of ibuprofen is 3200 mg. Overdosing on ibuprofen can cause severe toxicity, particularly in children ingesting 400 mg/kg or more. Complications of overdose include seizures, apnea, hypertension, and potential renal and hepatic dysfunction. Chronic administration of high-dose ibuprofen is also associated with increased risks of myocardial infarction.\n[42]\n\nManagement of Overdose\n\nThere is no available antidote for ibuprofen. The toxicity resolves with time and supportive care. The management of severe ibuprofen toxicity typically involves supportive care and interventions like continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) or hemodialysis (HD). Despite ibuprofen's large molecule size and high protein binding, which typically limits dialysis clearance, CRRT can stabilize metabolic balance and support hemodynamics. In patients with significant metabolic acidosis and hemodynamic instability, CRRT may be initiated to facilitate the gradual elimination of ibuprofen and restore homeostasis, even though it does not acutely remove the drug.\n[75]\n\nSelective Plasma Adsorption (SPAD) has demonstrated potential as a treatment for severe ibuprofen overdose. This process uses albumin dialysate to eliminate highly protein-bound toxins, improving outcomes for patients with multi-organ failure and shock.\n[76]"
