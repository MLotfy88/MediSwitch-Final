    "indications": "Uremic pruritus, also called chronic kidney disease (CKD)-associated pruritus (CKD-aP), is a common and debilitating symptom experienced by patients with CKD and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which causes significant discomfort to patients. The condition is characterized by itching related to CKD and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Uremic pruritus is commonly defined as the daily or near-daily experience of itching without a primary dermatologic finding. It is a common symptom that causes significant discomfort to patients with ESRD. However, other conditions that cause itching, such as eczema, liver disease, atopy, and thyroid diseases, should be excluded before diagnosing uremic pruritus.\n\nMore than 40% of hemodialysis patients suffer from chronic pruritus, with half experiencing generalized pruritus.\n[1]\nThe underlying pathogenic mechanism of CKD-aP remains obscure. Histamine, parathyroid hormone (PTH), magnesium, and calcium have been associated with its pathogenesis. Newer studies are evaluating opioid-receptor abnormalities and microinflammation as potential causes of CKD-aP, although more data are required.\n[2]\n\nPruritus can be extremely difficult to manage due to limited treatment options. Stepwise management is recommended, starting with topical emollients, gabapentin, and phototherapy. More novel options, such as μ-opioid receptor antagonists or κ-opioid receptor agonists, may be chosen in refractory cases. In advanced cases, patients may undergo transplantation, as a successful renal transplant will relieve patients from CKD-aP.\n[3]\n[4]",
    "mechanism": "The etiopathogenesis of uremic pruritus is poorly understood.\n[5]\nIn the pathogenesis of itching, compounds such as histamine, prostaglandins, cytokines, neuropeptides, and proteases activate neurons to send itch signals to the central nervous system via secondary neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Proposed pruritogenic toxins in CKD include aluminum, calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone (PTH). However, the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS; 2012-2015) did not show any association between pruritus and serum calcium or phosphorus levels.\n[6]\n\nOther contributory factors are increased blood urea,\nβ\n2-microglobulin, magnesium, and vitamin A.\n[7]\n[8]\nSome studies have found that lower serum albumin levels and higher white blood cell counts are significantly associated with moderate-to-extreme pruritus.\n[8]\n[9]\nIn addition, anemia, low erythropoietin levels, elevated ferritin, and low transferrin have also been explored as potential risks for CKD-aP.\n[10]\nCurrent proposed pathophysiological mechanisms for uremic pruritus include skin alterations, inflammation, nociceptive receptor dysfunction, and opioid receptor dysfunction. Although many patients with CKD experience dry skin (xerosis), not all individuals with severely dry skin have itching.\n[11]\nNociceptive receptor dysfunction and peripheral neuropathy resulting from diseased sensory neurons and interneurons are also believed to contribute to itching.\n[8]\nSkin microinflammation is also proposed to contribute to uremic pruritus, as a study revealed elevated C-reactive protein levels have been observed in ESRD patients on hemodialysis with the condition. In addition, the opioid pathway is increasingly linked to itch sensation.\n[12]\nA theory postulates that an imbalance between μ-opioid and κ-opioid receptors (specifically, μ-overstimulation and κ-antagonism) may cause itching.\n[8]\nMoreover, other potential triggering factors include uremic toxins, cutaneous xerosis, systemic inflammation, and common comorbid conditions, including diabetes mellitus, viral hepatitis, and endocrinopathies.\n[13]\n[14]",
    "monitoring": "Uremic pruritus is a clinical diagnosis. Due to the high prevalence of itching among patients with CKD, most instances of itching are attributed to uremic pruritus without considering alternate diagnoses. However, it is essential to rule out other causes of pruritus, including drug reactions, liver disease, thyroid disease, and dermatologic conditions.\n[29]\n\nBefore initiating treatment for pruritus, it is advisable to obtain objective information about its severity to monitor the response to treatment. A recent study recommended a set of methods for use in clinical trials to evaluate pruritus, including pruritus intensity scales, equipment to assess scratch lesions, quality of life measures, chronic pruritus course, and patient benefit from therapy.\n[30]\n\nAssessing the severity of symptoms and their impact on sleep is also essential. Various tools are used to evaluate uremic pruritus, including the visual analog scale, verbal rating scale, numeric rating scale, 5-dimensional (5-D) itch scale, and Kidney Disease Quality of Life-Short Form.\n[8]\nOther psychometric tests, such as the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form assessment and the Uremic Pruritus in Dialysis Patients scale, have also been used for evaluation.\n\nThe visual analog scale, numeric rating scale, and verbal rating scale are unidimensional tools used to measure symptom severity, including pruritus severity. The visual analog scale uses a graphic scale where patients select a point that describes the severity of their symptoms. For example, 0 represents no itching, and 10 illustrates the worst imaginable itching. The numeric rating scale is similar to the visual rating scale, but patients are asked to select a number representing itching severity. For example, it may be classified as none (0), mild (1-3), moderate (4-6), severe (7-8), and very severe (9 and above).\n\nThe 5-D itch scale is a multidimensional tool with 5 domains—duration, degree, direction, disability, and distribution. The disability domain assesses the effect of pruritus on sleep, leisure, housework, and work or school.\n[31]\nPruritus is a subjective symptom, making its assessment challenging. Although scratch marks can be quantified, this method is often inaccurate when measuring the symptom's extent. Therefore, pruritus is typically assessed through patient-reported outcomes. Various patient-reported outcome scales are available for estimating pruritus intensity, including unidimensional scales that address one symptom at a time and multidimensional scales that monitor multiple symptoms, variations in symptoms, or different aspects of the symptom.\n[30]",
    "administration": "Consensus recommendations for managing uremic pruritus are lacking, making it challenging for clinicians to treat these patients effectively. Some strategies are listed below.\n\nOptimizing Serum Calcium and Phosphate Levels\n\nClinicians may attempt to alleviate itching symptoms by optimizing serum calcium and phosphate levels as part of the overall care for CKD patients. However, the DOPPS trial found no relationship between serum phosphate levels and uremic pruritus, raising questions about the efficacy of this strategy. Additionally, there are no established target levels to guide treatment.\n\nDialysis Optimization\n\nThis strategy is proposed to lower the levels of pruritogens in the body. Although no specific target\nKt/V\nhas been established for managing pruritus, it is recommended to use the\nKt/V\ntargets associated with optimal clinical outcomes. Dialysis optimization may include increasing the frequency of dialysis sessions and switching from low-flux to high-flux dialyzers.\n\nTopical Agents\n\nIn addition to optimizing dialysis and managing serum calcium and phosphate levels, skin care—particularly hydration—is crucial for managing uremic pruritus. Topical treatments for uremic pruritus include:\n\nEmollients: These are widely recommended for managing uremic pruritus. Patients with CKD often experience xerosis, and emollients have demonstrated benefits in alleviating CKD-aP. Various types of emollients, such as paraffin and glycerol, have been studied and shown to provide relief.\nγ-Linoleic acid cream: This cream may provide relief for uremic pruritus.\n[32]\nTopical analgesics: Capsaicin and pramoxine lotion have demonstrated a superior response compared to placebo in studies.\n[33]\nTacrolimus: This calcineurin inhibitor reduces interleukin-2 production and has shown benefits in treating uremic pruritus.\n[34]\nHowever, topical tacrolimus carries a black box warning for an increased risk of skin cancers. Therefore, it should be used with caution in renal transplant patients who already have an already elevated risk of skin cancers.\n\nAntihistamines\n\nAntihistamines are commonly used as a therapeutic strategy to manage uremic pruritis, but their effectiveness is uncertain. Sedating antihistamines may provide more symptom relief compared to nonsedating antihistamines. However, their use, particularly in older adults, raises safety concerns due to potential adverse effects.\n[8]\n\nGabapentin and Pregabalin\n\nThese anticonvulsants, which are commonly used to manage neuropathic pain, have also shown effectiveness in treating CKD-aP. A systematic review indicated that both gabapentin and pregabalin provide superior benefits compared to placebo.\n[35]\nAdverse effects of gabapentin include dizziness, somnolence, confusion, dry mouth, and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts, which can limit the use of gabapentin and pregabalin. Pregabalin may be better tolerated by some patients who do not respond well to gabapentin. Gabapentin can be initiated at 100 mg 3 times weekly (post-dialysis) and increased to 300 mg 3 times weekly, or started at 100 mg daily.\n\nMast Cell Stabilizers\n\nHydroxyzine, cromolyn sodium, and nicotinamide have been investigated as potential treatments for uremic pruritus. Hydroxyzine acts as a histamine-1 receptor antagonist, while nicotinamide and cromolyn sodium work by stabilizing mast cells.\n\nIn a randomized, double-blind, prospective 4-week study involving 60 patients with ESRD, cromolyn sodium cream showed some benefits compared to placebo.\n[36]\nIn other studies, hydroxyzine and nicotinamide reduced pruritus, but they did not confer a statistically significant benefit compared to diluted vinegar or placebo, respectively.\n[37]\n[38]\n\nPhototherapy\n\nUV-B modulates the immune response by altering cytokine production. Narrowband UV-A, broadband UV-B, and narrowband UV-B therapy benefit patients with uremic pruritus. However, broadband UV-B treatment has demonstrated a superior response over UV-A therapy in treating uremic pruritus.\n[8]\nAlthough a study comparing narrowband UV-B therapy and long-wave UV-A therapy found improvement in symptoms in both groups, it did not find any difference in response.\n[39]\nDespite significant improvement in symptoms, a high drop-out rate has also been reported with narrowband UV-B therapy.\n[40]\nAdverse effects reported following UV-B treatment include sunburn and tanning.\n\nOpioid Receptor Modulation\n\nAn imbalance in μ- and κ-opioid receptors is linked to pruritus. κ-Agonism and μ-antagonism have been found to relieve itching, and these mechanisms are being explored as potential therapeutic options.\n\nDifelikefalin:\nThis drug is a selective κ-opioid receptor agonist indicated for treating CKD-aP in adult hemodialysis patients. Difelikefalin does not cross the brain-blood barrier and thus does not cause the severe characteristic central nervous system adverse effects linked with opioids. The potential for abuse is low, as it does not act on the μ-receptors, which mediate euphoria.\n\nIn a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial involving 174 hemodialysis patients with moderate-to-severe pruritus, difelikefalin improved itching and sleep disturbance scores compared with patients on placebo.\n[41]\nHowever, patients in the difelikefalin arm also reported more adverse events, with diarrhea, dizziness, nausea, somnolence, and falls being the most frequent. Dizziness is typically transient and subsides within 3 weeks if treatment is continued.\n\nNalfurafine:\nThis drug is another selective κ-opioid agonist that shows promise in treating uremic pruritus.\n[8]\nStudies did not show the benefits of nalfurafine hydrochloride infusion post-hemodialysis, but oral nalfurafine administered daily improved itching. Nalfurafine is associated with insomnia, but this resolves rapidly upon discontinuing the therapy. Nalfurafine is currently approved in Japan.\n\nNalbuphine:\nThis drug acts on both κ- and μ-opioid receptors and has also proved beneficial in hemodialysis patients with pruritus. Extended-release nalbuphine has been used at a dose of 120 mg to achieve a response among hemodialysis patients.\n[42]",
