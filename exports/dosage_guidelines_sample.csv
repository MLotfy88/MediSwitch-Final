,,,,,8,,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Each pump of the LidoRx 3% bottle in 30mL Airless Pumps (NDC:35781-0300-3) will deliver 0.25 mL of LidoRx 3% enough to cover a 2 x 2 inch area of skin.. A single application should not exceed 10 g of LidoRx 3%, containing 300 mg of Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP; This would equal 40 pumps of the 30mL Airless bottle.. In a 70 kg adult this dose equals 4.3 mg/kg (1.9 mg/lb) Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP.. No more than one 30mL Airless Pump bottle, approximately 30g of LidoRx 3% or 900 mg Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP, should be administered in any one day.. Although the incidence of adverse effects with LidoRx 3% is quite low, caution should be exercised, particularly when employing large amounts, since the incidence of adverse effects is directly proportional to the total dose of local anesthetic agent administered.. Dosage for children: It is difficult to recommend a maximum dose of any drug for children since this varies as a function of age and weight.. For children less than ten years who have a normal lean body mass and a normal lean body development, the maximum dose may be determined by the application of one of the standard pediatric drug formulas (e.g., Clark’s rule).. For example a child of five years weighing 50 lbs., the dose of lidocaine should not exceed 75-100 mg when calculated according to Clark’s rule.. In any case, the maximum amount of Lidocaine Hydrochloride USP administered should not exceed 4.3 mg/kg (2.0 mg/lb) of body weight.. Administration Apply a thin film to the affected area two or three times daily not to exceed 12 pumps in twenty four hours (24Hrs).",,,,,,Topical

( 2.1 , 5.2 ) Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection.. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments.. ( 2.2 , 5.3 ) For Relief of Pain: Titrate the dose based upon the individual patients’ response to their initial dose of Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection ( 2.2 , 5 ) Adults: 50 mg to 150 mg intramuscularly or subcutaneously every 3 to 4 hours.. ( 2.2 ) Children: 0.5 mg/lb to 0.8 mg/lb intramuscularly or subcutaneously up to the adult dose every 3 to 4 hours.. ( 2.2 ) Preoperative Medication: Adults: 50 mg to 150 mg intramuscularly or subcutaneously, 30 to 90 minutes before beginning anesthesia.. ( 2.3 ) Children: 0.5 mg/lb to 1 mg/lb intramuscularly or subcutaneously up to the adult dose, 30 to 90 minutes before beginning anesthesia..

( 2.4 ) Do not abruptly discontinue Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection abruptly in a physically dependent patient.. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.. Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection.. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] .. Inspect Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.. If intravenous administration is required, dosage should be decreased and the injection made very slowly, preferably utilizing a diluted solution.. Adults: Initiate treatment in a dosing range of 50 mg to 150 mg intramuscularly or subcutaneously every 3 to 4 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia.. Elderly patients should usually be given meperidine at the lower end of the dose range and observed closely.. Children: Initiate treatment in a dosing range of 0.5 mg/lb to 0.8 mg/lb intramuscularly or subcutaneously up to the adult dose, every 3 to 4 hours as necessary, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia.. Titration and Maintenance of Therapy Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient’s response to their initial dose of Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection.. Individually titrate Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions.. Continually reevaluate patients receiving Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and other adverse reactions, as well as to reassess for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.15 )].. If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection dosage.. Discontinuation of Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection When a patient who has been taking Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection regularly and may be physically-dependent no longer requires therapy with Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection, taper the dose gradually, by 25% to 50% every 2 to 4 days, while monitoring carefully for signs and symptoms of withdrawal.. Do not abruptly discontinue Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection in a physically-dependent patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) , Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ] .. 2.3 For Preoperative Medication Adults: The usual dosage is 50 mg to 100 mg intramuscularly or subcutaneously, 30 to 90 minutes before the beginning of anesthesia.. Children: The usual dosage is 0.5 mg/lb to 1 mg/lb intramuscularly or subcutaneously up to the adult dose, 30 to 90 minutes before the beginning of anesthesia.. 2.4 For Support of Anesthesia Repeated slow intravenous injections of fractional doses (e.g., 10 mg/mL) or continuous intravenous infusion of a more dilute solution (e.g., 1 mg/mL) should be used.. 5 For Obstetrical Analgesia The usual dosage is 50 mg to 100 mg intramuscularly or subcutaneously when pain becomes regular, and may be repeated at 1- to 3-hour intervals.. 2.6 Dosage Modifications with Concomitant Phenothiazines The dose of Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection should be proportionately reduced (usually by 25 to 50 percent) when administered concomitantly with phenothiazines and many other tranquilizers since they potentiate the action of Meperidine Hydrochloride Injection.",,,,,,Intravenous

Patients who do not react to a valid scratch or prick-puncture test should be tested intradermally with 0.02 to 0.05 mL of a 10 AU/mL (1:1,000 v/v of the 10,000 AU/mL concentrate).. THERAPEUTIC USE: The dosage of mite extract administered by subcutaneous injection is highly individualized and varies according to the degree of sensitivity of the patient, his clinical response and tolerance to the extract administered during the early phases of an injection regimen.. In patients who appear to be highly sensitive by history and skin test, the initial dose of the extract should be 0.05 mL of a 0.1 AU/mL dilution or as established by skin test titration.. The amount of allergenic extract is increased at each injection by not more than 50% - 100% of the previous amount, and the next increment is governed by the response to the last injection.. The upper limits of dosage have not been established; however, doses larger than 0.2 mL of the concentrate may be painful due to the glycerin content of the extract.. However, as is customarily practiced, injections are given one or two times per week until the maintenance dose of extract is reached.. At this time, the injection interval may be increased to 2 weeks, then to 3 weeks and finally to 4 weeks.. If the patient does not return for 6 to 8 weeks after the last injection, the dose should be reduced to 25% of the last dose.. If longer than 8 weeks, a dose reduction of one, two or three dilutions may be made depending on a consideration of the components and the patient's sensitivity The dosage and the interval between injections may need to be modified according to the clinical response of the patient.. When switching patients to fresh extract, the initial dose should be reduced to one-quarter (25%) of the previous dose.. A period of three to five years of injection therapy constitutes an average course of treatment.. Children and older age patients appear to tolerate injections of allergenic extract well, and no special recommendations need to be made for these groups.. PREPARING DILUTIONS To prepare dilutions for intradermal skin tests and therapeutic use as shown in the table below, make a series of ten-fold dilutions starting with the 5,000 AU/mL or 10,000 AU/mL as follows: add 1.0 mL of the concentrate to 9.0 mL of sterile diluent to make the 1:10 dilution; add 1.0 mL of the 1:10 dilution to 9.0 mL of sterile diluent to make the 1:100 dilution.",,,,,,Subcutaneous

,,,,,,,"Adult A single application should not exceed 5 g of Lidocaine Ointment USP, 5%, containing 250 mg of lidocaine base (equivalent chemically to approximately 300 mg of lidocaine hydrochloride).. In a 70 kg adult this dose equals 3.6 mg/kg (1.6 mg/lb) lidocaine base.. No more than one-half tube, approximately 17-20 g of ointment or 850-1000 mg lidocaine base, should be administered in any one day.. Although the incidence of adverse effects with Lidocaine Ointment USP, 5% is quite low, caution should be exercised, particularly when employing large amounts, since the incidence of adverse effects is directly proportional to the total dose of local anesthetic agent administered.. Dosage for children It is difficult to recommend a maximum dose of any drug for children since this varies as a function of age and weight.. For children less than ten years who have a normal lean body mass and a normal lean body development, the maximum dose may be determined by the application of one of the standard pediatric drug formulas (e.g., Clark's rule).. For example a child of five years weighing 50 lbs., the dose of lidocaine should not exceed 75-100 mg when calculated according to Clark's rule.. In any case, the maximum amount of lidocaine administered should not exceed 4.5 mg/kg (2.0 mg/lb) of body weight.. Administration For medical use, apply topically for adequate control of symptoms..

In clinical trials of quinapril and hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy using quinapril doses of 2.5 to 40 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6.25 to 25 mg, the antihypertensive effects increased with increasing dose of either component.. In clinical trials of quinapril HCl and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, the average change in serum potassium was near zero in subjects who received HCTZ 6.25 mg in the combination, and the average subject who received 10 to 40/12.5 to 25 mg experienced a milder reduction in serum potassium than that experienced by the average subject receiving the same dose of hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy.. Therapy Guided by Clinical Effect Patients whose blood pressures are not adequately controlled with quinapril monotherapy may instead be given quinapril HCl and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 10/12.5 or 20/12.5.. Patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with 25 mg of daily hydrochlorothiazide, but who experience significant potassium loss with this regimen, may achieve blood pressure control with less electrolyte disturbance if they are switched to quinapril HCl and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 10/12.5 or 20/12.5..

,,,,,168,,"Special Dispensing Information WHEN DISPENSING VINBLASTINE SULFATE IN OTHER THAN THE ORIGINAL CONTAINER, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT IT BE PACKAGED IN THE PROVIDED OVERWRAP WHICH BEARS THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT: “DO NOT REMOVE COVERING UNTIL MOMENT OF INJECTION.. FATAL IF GIVEN INTRATHECALLY.. A syringe containing a specific dose must be labeled, using the auxiliary sticker provided, to state: “FATAL IF GIVEN INTRATHECALLY.. Caution: It is extremely important that the intravenous needle or catheter be properly positioned before any vinblastine sulfate is injected.. If extravasation occurs, the injection should be discontinued immediately, and any remaining portion of the dose should then be introduced into another vein.. Local injection of hyaluronidase and the application of moderate heat to the area of leakage help disperse the drug and minimize discomfort and the possibility of cellulitis.. For this reason, it is recommended that the drug be given no more frequently than once every 7 days.. Adult patients It is wise to initiate therapy for adults by administering a single intravenous dose of 3.7 mg/m 2 of body surface area (bsa).. A simplified and conservative incremental approach to dosage at weekly intervals for adults may be outlined as follows: First dose...........................3.7 mg/m 2 bsa Second dose......................5.5 mg/m 2 bsa Third dose..........................7.4 mg/m 2 bsa Fourth dose........................9.25 mg/m 2 bsa Fifth dose...........................11.1 mg/m 2 bsa The above-mentioned increases may be used until a maximum dose not exceeding 18.5 mg/m 2 bsa for adults is reached.. In some adults, 3.7 mg/m 2 bsa may produce this leukopenia; other adults may require more than 11.1 mg/m 2 bsa; and, very rarely, as much as 18.5 mg/m 2 bsa may be necessary.. For most adult patients, however, the weekly dosage will prove to be 5.5 to 7.4 mg/m 2 bsa.. When the dose of vinblastine sulfate which will produce the above degree of leukopenia has been established, a dose of 1 increment smaller than this should be administered at weekly intervals for maintenance.. Thus, the patient is receiving the maximum dose that does not cause leukopenia.. It should be emphasized that, even though 7 days have elapsed, the next dose of vinblastine sulfate should not be given until the white-cell count has returned to at least 4000/mm 3.. Pediatric Patients A review of published literature from 1993 to 1995 showed that initial doses of vinblastine sulfate in pediatric patients varied depending on the schedule used and whether vinblastine sulfate was administered as a single agent or incorporated within a particular chemotherapeutic regimen.. As a single agent for Letterer-Siwe disease (histiocytosis X), the initial dose of vinblastine sulfate was reported as 6.5 mg/m 2.. When vinblastine sulfate was used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of Hodgkin’s disease, the initial dose was reported as 6 mg/m 2.. For testicular germ cell carcinomas, the initial dose of vinblastine sulfate was reported as 3 mg/m 2 in a combination regimen.. Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment A reduction of 50% in the dose of vinblastine sulfate is recommended for patients having a direct serum bilirubin value above 3 mg/100 mL.. To prepare a solution containing 1 mg/mL of vinblastine sulfate, add 10 mL of Bacteriostatic Sodium Chloride Injection (preserved with benzyl alcohol) or 10 mL of Sodium Chloride Injection (unpreserved) to the 10 mg of Vinblastine Sulfate for Injection in the sterile vial.. The drug dissolves instantly to give a clear solution.. The dose of vinblastine sulfate (calculated to provide the desired amount) may be injected either into the tubing of a running intravenous infusion or directly into a vein.. In either case, the injection may be completed in about 1 minute.. If care is taken to insure that the needle is securely within the vein and that no solution containing vinblastine sulfate is spilled extravascularly, cellulitis and/or phlebitis will not occur.. The dose should not be diluted in large volumes of diluent (i.e., 100 to 250 mL) or given intravenously for prolonged periods (ranging from 30 to 60 minutes or more), since this frequently results in irritation of the vein and increases the chance of extravasation.. Because of the enhanced possibility of thrombosis, it is considered inadvisable to inject a solution of vinblastine sulfate into an extremity in which the circulation is impaired or potentially impaired by such conditions as compressing or invading neoplasm, phlebitis, or varicosity.",,,,,,Intravenous

( 2.2 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosing Nicardipine hydrochloride injection is intended for intravenous use.. Ampule must be diluted to 0.1 mg/ml before use [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].. Dosage as a Substitute for Oral Nicardipine Therapy The intravenous infusion rate required to produce an average plasma concentration equivalent to a given oral dose at steady state is shown in Oral Equivalent Dosage Oral Nicardipine Dose Equivalent I.V.. Infusion Rate (0.1 mg/mL) 20 mg q8h 0.5 mg/hr = 5 mL/hr 30 mg q8h 1.2 mg/hr = 12 mL/hr 40 mg q8h 2.2 mg/hr = 22 mL/hr Dosage for Initiation of Therapy in a Patient Not Receiving Oral Nicardipine Initiate therapy at 50 mL/hr (5 mg/hr).. If desired blood pressure reduction is not achieved at this dose, the infusion rate may be increased by 25 mL/hr (2.5 mg/hr) every 5 minutes (for rapid titration) to 15 minutes (for gradual titration) up to a maximum of 150 mL/hr (15 mg/hr), until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved.. Following achievement of the blood pressure goal utilizing rapid titration, decrease the infusion rate to 30 mL/hr (3 mg/hr).. If treatment includes transfer to an oral antihypertensive agent other than oral nicardipine, initiate therapy upon discontinuation of nicardipine hydrochloride injection.. If oral nicardipine is to be used, administer the first dose 1 hour prior to discontinuation of the infusion.. Specific Populations Titrate nicardipine hydrochloride injection slowly in patients with heart failure or impaired hepatic or renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3 and 5.4)] 2.2 Monitoring The time course of blood pressure decrease is dependent on the initial rate of infusion and the frequency of dosage adjustment.. Then, when blood pressure has stabilized, restart infusion of nicardipine hydrochloride injection at low doses such as 30 to 50 mL/hr (3 to 5 mg/hr) and adjusted to maintain desired blood pressure.. 2.3 Instructions for Administration Administer nicardipine hydrochloride injection by a central line or through a large peripheral vein.. Change the infusion site every 12 hours if administered via peripheral vein [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5..

All patients should be premedicated prior to paclitaxel injection administration in order to prevent severe hypersensitivity reactions.. Such premedication may consist of dexamethasone 20 mg PO administered approximately 12 and 6 hours before paclitaxel injection, diphenhydramine (or its equivalent) 50 mg IV 30 to 60 minutes prior to paclitaxel injection, and cimetidine (300 mg) or ranitidine (50 mg) IV 30 to 60 minutes before paclitaxel injection.. For previously untreated patients with carcinoma of the ovary, one of the following recommended regimens may be given every 3 weeks.. • Paclitaxel Injection administered intravenously over 3 hours at a dose of 175 mg/m 2 followed by cisplatin at a dose of 75 mg/m 2 ; or • Paclitaxel Injection administered intravenously over 24 hours at a dose of 135 mg/m 2 followed by cisplatin at a dose of 75 mg/m 2 .. In patients previously treated with chemotherapy for carcinoma of the ovary, paclitaxel injection has been used at several doses and schedules; however, the optimal regimen is not yet clear.. The recommended regimen is paclitaxel injection 135 mg/m 2 or 175 mg/m 2 administered intravenously over 3 hours every 3 weeks.. For the adjuvant treatment of node-positive breast cancer, the recommended regimen is paclitaxel injection, at a dose of 175 mg/m 2 intravenously over 3 hours every 3 weeks for 4 courses administered sequentially to doxorubicin-containing combination chemotherapy.. After failure of initial chemotherapy for metastatic disease or relapse within 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy, paclitaxel injection at a dose of 175 mg/m 2 administered intravenously over 3 hours every 3 weeks has been shown to be effective.. For patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma , the recommended regimen, given every 3 weeks, is paclitaxel injection administered intravenously over 24 hours at a dose of 135 mg/m 2 followed by cisplatin, 75 mg/m 2 .. For patients with AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma , paclitaxel injection administered at a dose of 135 mg/m 2 given intravenously over 3 hours every 3 weeks or at a dose of 100 mg/m 2 given intravenously over 3 hours every 2 weeks is recommended (dose intensity 45–50 mg/m 2 /week).. In the 2 clinical trials evaluating these schedules (see CLINICAL STUDIES: AIDS-Related Kaposi’s Sarcoma ), the former schedule (135 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks) was more toxic than the latter.. In addition, all patients with low performance status were treated with the latter schedule (100 mg/m 2 every 2 weeks).. Reduce the dose of dexamethasone as 1 of the 3 premedication drugs to 10 mg PO (instead of 20 mg PO); 2.. Initiate or repeat treatment with paclitaxel injection only if the neutrophil count is atleast 1000 cells/mm 3 ; 3.. Reduce the dose of subsequent courses of paclitaxel injection by 20% for patients who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophil <500 cells/mm 3 for a week or longer); and 4.. For the therapy of patients with solid tumors (ovary, breast, and NSCLC), courses of paclitaxel injection should not be repeated until the neutrophil count is at least 1500 cells/mm 3 and the platelet count is at least 100,000 cells/mm 3 .. Paclitaxel Injection should not be given to patients with AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma if the baseline or subsequent neutrophil count is less than 1000 cells/mm 3 ..

,,,,2.5 mg,,,"BECAUSE SERIOUS AND LIFE-THREATENING CARDIORESPIRATORY ADVERSE EVENTS HAVE BEEN REPORTED, PROVISION FOR MONITORING, DETECTION AND CORRECTION OF THESE REACTIONS MUST BE MADE FOR EVERY PATIENT TO WHOM midazolam hydrochloride INJECTION IS ADMINISTERED, REGARDLESS OF AGE OR HEALTH STATUS.. Midazolam hydrochloride should only be administered IM or IV (see WARNINGS ).. Care should be taken to avoid intra-arterial injection or extravasation (see WARNINGS ).. Midazolam hydrochloride Injection may be mixed in the same syringe with the following frequently used premedications: morphine sulfate, meperidine, atropine sulfate or scopolamine.. Midazolam hydrochloride, at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL, is compatible with 5% dextrose in water and 0.9% sodium chloride for up to 24 hours and with lactated Ringer's solution for up to 4 hours.. Both the 1 mg/mL and 5 mg/mL formulations of midazolam hydrochloride may be diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% dextrose in water.. For intramuscular use, midazolam hydrochloride should be injected deep in a large muscle mass.. The recommended premedication dose of midazolam hydrochloride for good risk (ASA Physical Status I & II) adult patients below the age of 60 years is 0.07 to 0.08 mg/kg IM (approximately 5 mg IM) administered up to 1 hour before surgery.. The dose must be individualized and reduced when IM midazolam hydrochloride is administered to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, other higher risk surgical patients, patients 60 or more years of age, and patients who have received concomitant narcotics or other CNS depressants (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).. In a study of patients 60 years or older, who did not receive concomitant administration of narcotics, 2 to 3 mg (0.02 to 0.05 mg/kg) of midazolam hydrochloride produced adequate sedation during the preoperative period.. The dose of 1 mg IM midazolam hydrochloride may suffice for some older patients if the anticipated intensity and duration of sedation is less critical.. It can be administered concomitantly with atropine sulfate or scopolamine hydrochloride and reduced doses of narcotics.. Midazolam hydrochloride should always be titrated slowly; administer over at least 2 minutes and allow an additional 2 or more minutes to fully evaluate the sedative effect.. Midazolam hydrochloride 1 mg/mL formulation is recommended for sedation/anxiolysis/amnesia for procedures to facilitate slower injection.. Both the 1 mg/mL and the 5 mg/mL formulations may be diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% dextrose in water.. Some patients may respond to as little as 1 mg.. No more than 2.5 mg should be given over a period of at least 2 minutes.. A total dose greater than 5 mg is not usually necessary to reach the desired endpoint.. Patients Age 60 or Older , and Debilitated or Chronically Ill Patients : Because the danger of hypoventilation, airway obstruction, or apnea is greater in elderly patients and those with chronic disease states or decreased pulmonary reserve, and because the peak effect may take longer in these patients, increments should be smaller and the rate of injection slower.. No more than 1.5 mg should be given over a period of no less than 2 minutes.. If additional titration is necessary, it should be given at a rate of no more than 1 mg over a period of 2 minutes, waiting an additional 2 or more minutes each time to fully evaluate the sedative effect.. Total doses greater than 3.5 mg are not usually necessary.. Maintenance Dose : Additional doses to maintain the desired level of sedation may be given in increments of 25% of the dose used to first reach the sedative endpoint, but again only by slow titration, especially in the elderly and chronically ill or debilitated patient.. These additional doses should be given only after a thorough clinical evaluation clearly indicates the need for additional sedation.. When midazolam hydrochloride is used before other intravenous agents for induction of anesthesia, the initial dose of each agent may be significantly reduced, at times to as low as 25% of the usual initial dose of the individual agents.. Unpremedicated Patients : In the absence of premedication, an average adult under the age of 55 years will usually require an initial dose of 0.3 to 0.35 mg/kg for induction, administered over 20 to 30 seconds and allowing 2 minutes for effect.. If needed to complete induction, increments of approximately 25% of the patient’s initial dose may be used; induction may instead be completed with inhalational anesthetics.. In resistant cases, up to 0.6 mg/kg total dose may be used for induction, but such larger doses may prolong recovery.. Unpremedicated patients over the age of 55 years usually require less midazolam hydrochloride for induction; an initial dose of 0.3 mg/kg is recommended.. An initial dose of 0.2 to 0.25 mg/kg will usually suffice; in some cases, as little as 0.15 mg/kg may suffice.. Premedicated Patients : When the patient has received sedative or narcotic premedication, particularly narcotic premedication, the range of recommended doses is 0.15 to 0.35 mg/kg.. In average adults below the age of 55 years, a dose of 0.25 mg/kg, administered over 20 to 30 seconds and allowing 2 minutes for effect, will usually suffice.. The initial dose of 0.2 mg/kg is recommended for good risk (ASA I & II) surgical patients over the age of 55 years.. In some patients with severe systemic disease or debilitation, as little as 0.15 mg/kg may suffice.. Narcotic premedication frequently used during clinical trials included fentanyl (1.5 to 2 mcg/kg IV, administered 5 minutes before induction), morphine (dosage individualized, up to 0.15 mg/kg IM), and meperidine (dosage individualized, up to 1 mg/kg IM).. Sedative premedications were hydroxyzine pamoate (100 mg orally) and sodium secobarbital (200 mg orally).. Except for intravenous fentanyl, administered 5 minutes before induction, all other premedications should be administered approximately 1 hour prior to the time anticipated for midazolam hydrochloride induction.. Injectable midazolam hydrochloride can also be used during maintenance of anesthesia, for surgical procedures, as a component of balanced anesthesia.. Incremental injections of approximately 25% of the induction dose should be given in response to signs of lightening of anesthesia and repeated as necessary.. CONTINUOUS INFUSION For continuous infusion, midazolam hydrochloride 5 mg/mL formulation is recommended diluted to a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL with 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% dextrose in water.. Usual Adult Dose : If a loading dose is necessary to rapidly initiate sedation, 0.01 to 0.05 mg/kg (approximately 0.5 to 4.0 mg for a typical adult) may be given slowly or infused over several minutes.. For maintenance of sedation, the usual initial infusion rate is 0.02 to 0.10 mg/kg/hr (1 to 7 mg/hr).. When midazolam hydrochloride is given in conjunction with opioids or other sedatives, the potential for respiratory depression, airway obstruction, or hypoventilation is increased.. Doses of 0.1 to 0.15 mg/kg are usually effective and do not prolong emergence from general anesthesia.. For more anxious patients, doses up to 0.5 mg/kg have been used.. Although not systematically studied, the total dose usually does not exceed 10 mg.. If midazolam hydrochloride is given with an opioid, the initial dose of each must be reduced.. INTRAVENOUSLY BY INTERMITTENT INJECTION For sedation/anxiolysis/amnesia prior to and during procedures or prior to anesthesia.. The initial dose of midazolam hydrochloride should be administered over 2 to 3 minutes.. Since midazolam hydrochloride is water soluble, it takes approximately three times longer than diazepam to achieve peak EEG effects, therefore one must wait an additional 2 to 3 minutes to fully evaluate the sedative effect before initiating a procedure or repeating a dose.. Pediatric Patients 6 Months to 5 Years of Age: Initial dose 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg; total dose up to 0.6 mg/kg may be necessary to reach the desired endpoint but usually does not exceed 6 mg.. Pediatric Patients 6 to 12 Years of Age: Initial dose 0.025 to 0.05 mg/kg; total dose up to 0.4 mg/kg may be needed to reach the desired endpoint but usually does not exceed 10 mg.. Prolonged sedation may be associated with higher doses; some patients in this age range will require higher than recommended adult doses but the total dose usually does not exceed 10 mg.. Higher risk or debilitated patients may require lower dosages whether or not concomitant sedating medications have been administered (see WARNINGS ).. USUAL PEDIATRIC DOSE (NON-NEONATAL) To initiate sedation, an intravenous loading dose of 0.05 to 0.2 mg/kg administered over at least 2 to 3 minutes can be used to establish the desired clinical effect IN PATIENTS WHOSE TRACHEA IS INTUBATED.. (Midazolam hydrochloride should not be administered as a rapid intravenous dose.) This loading dose may be followed by a continuous intravenous infusion to maintain the effect.. Based on pharmacokinetic parameters and reported clinical experience, continuous intravenous infusions of midazolam hydrochloride should be initiated at a rate of 0.06 to 0.12 mg/kg/hr (1 to 2 mcg/kg/min).. The rate of infusion can be increased or decreased (generally by 25% of the initial or subsequent infusion rate) as required, or supplemental intravenous doses of midazolam hydrochloride can be administered to increase or maintain the desired effect.. Hypotension may be observed in patients who are critically ill, particularly those receiving opioids and/or when midazolam hydrochloride is rapidly administered.. USUAL NEONATAL DOSE Based on pharmacokinetic parameters and reported clinical experience in preterm and term neonates WHOSE TRACHEA WAS INTUBATED, continuous intravenous infusions of midazolam hydrochloride should be initiated at a rate of 0.03 mg/kg/hr (0.5 mcg/kg/min) in neonates <32 weeks and 0.06 mg/kg/hr (1 mcg/kg/min) in neonates >32 weeks.. The rate of infusion should be carefully and frequently reassessed, particularly after the first 24 hours so as to administer the lowest possible effective dose and reduce the potential for drug accumulation.. Hypotension may be observed in patients who are critically ill and in preterm and term infants, particularly those receiving fentanyl and/or when midazolam hydrochloride is administered rapidly.",,,,,,Intravenous

Jordan, UT, USA) BSC Renegade Hi-Flo (Boston-Scientific Corp.; Natick, MA, USA) Terumo Progreat (Terumo Medical Corp., Somerset, NJ, USA) INDICATIONS FOR USE HEPZATO KIT™, containing HEPZATO for injection, is indicated as a liverdirected treatment for adult patients with uveal melanoma with unresectable hepatic metastases affecting less than 50% of the liver and no extrahepatic disease or extrahepatic disease limited to the bone, lymph nodes, subcutaneous tissues, or lung that is amenable to resection or radiation.. Peri-Procedural Complications Hemorrhage, hepatocellular injury, and thromboembolic events have been observed when HEPZATO has been administered via hepatic intra-arterial administration.. To mitigate the risk of thromboembolic events, administer anticoagulation as described in the IFU during the procedure.. Important requirements of the HEPZATO KIT REMS include: Healthcare settings that dispense and administer HEPZATO KIT must be enrolled, certified, and comply with the REMS requirements.. Only administer HEPZATO in patients with platelets >100,000/microliter, hemoglobin ≥10.0 gm/dL and neutrophils >2,000/microliter.. Administer transfusions or growth factors as appropriate [see HEPZATO USPI Dosage and Administration (2.1)].. When a hypersensitivity reaction is observed, immediately terminate the hepatic arterial melphalan infusion and administer necessary supportive care [see HEPZATO USPI Contraindications (4), and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].. Do not administer HEPZATO KIT in patients with a history of severe allergic reactions or anaphylaxis to iodinated contrast [see IFU contraindications and HEPZATO USPI Contraindications (4)].. Administer a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) the day prior to and the morning of the procedure.. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on animal studies and its mechanism of action, melphalan can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.. PROCEDURE PREPARATION: PRIOR TO TREATMENT All medications and supportive measures must be determined and administered in accordance with each institution's policies, guidelines, procedures, and the HEPZATO KIT prescribing information.. Procedural hydration is required since 700 mL or more of blood will be displaced into the extracorporeal circulation.. Typically, total procedural fluid requirements range between 1,500 and 3,000 mL.. Allopurinol As a prophylaxis for electrolyte abnormalities, patients with more than 25% replacement of normal liver parenchyma with tumor are to be given allopurinol 300 mg/day orally beginning two (2) to three (3) days prior to percutaneous hepatic perfusion (PHP) with the Hepatic Delivery System and continuing two (2) to three (3) days following procedure.. Proton Pump Inhibitors Administer prophylactic proton pump inhibitors (for example: omeprazole, one 20 mg delayed release capsule by mouth) the day before and the morning of the procedure.. - Administer heparin to the patient only AFTER placement of the 18F (femoral vein), 10F (jugular vein), and 5F (femoral artery) sheaths.. Begin with an initial intravenous bolus of heparin at 300 units/kg, dose adjusted to achieve activated clotting time.. - Maintain activated clotting time at > 400 seconds throughout the procedure, assessing ACT values every 15 – 30 minutes depending on the patient's response and administering intravenous heparin as needed.. Anesthetic Management Treatment must be administered with patients being monitored and under general anesthesia.. Drug Preparation and Delivery Planning Prior to set up, provide pre-notification to the hospital pharmacy to be ready to reconstitute HEPZATO for injection.. (a) Utilizing strict aseptic technique, heparinize nine (9) liters of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection (normal saline) by adding 2,000-5,000 units of heparin per liter.. Note that clamps 1-10 are open Attach the CO 2 connection line to the stopcock “F” and open the stopcock Connect the open end of the CO 2 connection line to the CO 2 source Set the CO 2 source regulator to 3psi (approximately 3 liters per minute (LPM)) Start the CO 2 gas flow and allow the CO2 to flow through the extracorporeal hemofiltration circuit.. Three microcatheters have been qualified by Delcath for use with the HEPZATO for Injection/Hepatic Delivery System.. (c) Connect the infusion catheter (5F catheter or microcatheter) to the drug delivery system (see step 18) and maintain catheter patency by hospital catheter infusion protocols (e.g., infuse heparinized normal saline: The concentration of heparin should be 1,000 units per 500 mL of normal saline).. (b) DO NOT administer heparin until the placements of all vascular sheaths.. (d) Administer heparin.. (e) Administer an initial intravenous bolus of 300 units/kg of heparin.. Maintain activated clotting time at > 400 seconds (preferably > 450 seconds) throughout the procedure, obtaining ACT values every 15-30 minutes depending on the patient's response, and administering intravenous heparin as needed.. It is critical to maintain mean blood pressure above 65 mmHg Vasoactive Agents Response Testing: Prior to expansion of either balloon (occlusion of inferior vena cava), administer vasoactive agent to assess patient responsiveness to this agent.. Continue to administer vasoactive agents to maintain mean blood pressures above 65 mmHg.. (b) Maximum balloon expansion volumes: Cephalad Balloon: 38 mL of dilute contrast medium Caudal Balloon: 38 mL of dilute contrast medium (c) Under fluoroscopy, partially expand the cephalad balloon with approximately 15 - 25 mL of dilute contrast media (e.g., 35% dilution) within the right atrium (the balloon will have a rounded appearance).. Prior to injection of contrast medium, reduce the pump speed to 1,000 RPM and clamp off the circuit.. Inject iodinated contrast medium through the CONTRAST port to confirm that the catheter properly isolates hepatic venous flow between the balloons.. Reconstitute each melphalan vial with 10 mL of supplied diluent.. For doses up to 110 mg, dilute reconstituted HEPZATO in 250 mL 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection (use one (1) 250 mL bag provided).. For doses between 111 mg and 220 mg, divide the total dose equally into 2 and dilute each in 250 mL 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection (total volume of 500ml using the two (2) 250 mL bags provided).. Multiple injection cycles of the diluted HEPZATO solution will be required (see delivery parameters described below).. The duration of time between filters brought online and start of HEPZATO administration should be minimized on the order of < 5 minutes To deliver the drug solution, divide total volume into volumes within the capacity of the injector syringe.. Deliver drug solution at a flow rate of 25mL/min.. Refill syringe after each injection cycle.. Below are the delivery parameters: - Total volume of 500 mL – 5 infusions of 100 mL at 25mL/min - Total volume of 540 mL – 5 infusions of 100 mL + infusion of 40 mL at 25mL/min - Total volume of 250 mL – 2 infusions of 100 mL + infusion of 50 mL at 25 mL/min - Total volume of 270 mL – 2 infusions of 100 mL + infusion of 70 mL at 25 mL/min (a) Set-up drug delivery system by installing a 150 mL syringe into the drug injector and setting the injector flow rate to 25 mL/minute and enter the injection volume determined as described above.. The contrast is injected by hand via the syringe for the arteriogram.. Syringe Volume and Concentration to Prepare in Syringe Contrast Use institutional practices for microcatheter contrast delivery NTG Use institutional practices Normal Saline 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection (d) Hang a 500 mL bag of normal saline and the chemotherapeutic agent (melphalan hydrochloride) drug solution bag on the intravenous pole and ensure the roller clamps are closed, and spike the bags, as shown in .. HEPZATO Administration System Setup (e) Prime the drug delivery system with normal saline, fill injector syringe with approximately 120 mL of diluted drug.. In circumstances where hepatic arterial spasm is noted, administer nitroglycerin intraarterially to alleviate the spasm.. Always flush the injection line with normal saline after contrast injections.. Administer intra-arterial nitroglycerin if arterial spasm is noted.. (i) After the prescribed dose has been fully administered, continue extracorporeal filtration for an additional 30 minutes (washout period).. Normalization of Coagulation Status for Sheath Removal (a) Administer protamine sulfate by slow intravenous infusion in a dose appropriate to the amount of heparin given and the activated clotting time.. (b) Administer 10 units of cryoprecipitate and/or Fresh Frozen Plasma based on coagulation profiles to correct remaining abnormalities, if indicated, per institutional guidelines.. The following recommendations are provided for consideration: Coagulation Profile Action Prothrombin time greater than 2 seconds of normal Administer Fresh Frozen Plasma Partial thromboplastin time greater than 5 seconds of normal Administer protamine (e) Measure blood platelet levels to determine if replacement is needed.",,,,,,Oral

NEONATES: Hyperbilirubinemic neonates, especially prematures, should not be treated with ceftriaxone for injection (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).. Ceftriaxone for injection is contraindicated in neonates if they require (or are expected to require) treatment with calcium-containing IV solutions, including continuous calcium-containing infusions such as parenteral nutrition because of the risk of precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium (see CONTRAINDICATIONS)..
