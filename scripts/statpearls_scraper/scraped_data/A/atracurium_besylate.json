    "indications": "The primary contraindication to administration is hypersensitivity to atracurium besylate or excipients.\n[25]\nMultiple-dose vials contain benzyl alcohol as a preservative; hypersensitivity to benzyl alcohol is a contraindication to administration. Documented cross-reactivity to neuromuscular blockade drugs is limited, but atracurium should be used cautiously in patients with previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents.\n[26]\n[27]\n\nWarnings and Precautions\n\nRisk of allergic reactions and cross-reactivity with other neuromuscular blocking agents:\nAtracurium may trigger allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis) in susceptible individuals, especially if the patient has had prior reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents. Cross-reactivity between different agents in this class increases the need for careful monitoring and patient history-taking before administration. The American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology has recommended 1 mg/mL for skin prick tests and 0.01 mg/mL for intradermal tests. Positive results may indicate a higher risk of IgE-mediated reactions upon re-exposure, guiding anesthesia drug selection and suggesting structurally unrelated alternatives if needed.\n[25]\nCardiovascular disease, asthma, or history of anaphylactoid reactions:\nAtracurium is less likely to release histamine than other agents. However, histamine release can still occur, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease or a history of asthma and anaphylaxis. In these cases, a reduced dose of 0.3 to 0.4 mg/kg should be administered slowly to minimize adverse effects.\nRisk of bradycardia:\nUnlike other neuromuscular blockers, atracurium does not counteract bradycardia induced by anesthesia or vagal stimulation. Therefore, patients may experience bradycardia during anesthesia, necessitating closer monitoring and possible intervention.\nMyasthenia gravis, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, or neuromuscular diseases:\nPatients with neuromuscular disorders, including myasthenia gravis and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, are particularly sensitive to non-depolarizing muscle relaxants like atracurium.\n[28]\n[29]\nNeuromuscular function must be closely monitored using a peripheral nerve stimulator to prevent overdose and adverse drug reactions.\nMalignant hyperthermia:\nAlthough malignant hyperthermia (MH) is extremely rare when using atracurium, vigilance remains essential. MH has been primarily linked to halogenated anesthetics and succinylcholine, but clinicians should remain vigilant against this potentially fatal condition when administering anesthesia.\nResistance in burn patients:\nBurn patients may develop resistance to non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents like atracurium, requiring higher doses. The exact dosing adjustments depend on the size of the burn and the time since the injury. Resistance to non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) like rocuronium and atracurium has been associated with conditions such as denervation injury, infections, and metabolic disorders.\n[30]\nSafety concerns in bronchial asthma:\nThe safety of atracurium in patients with bronchial asthma has not been well established. Due to the potential for bronchospasm or histamine release, caution is required when administering atracurium to these individuals.\nLong-term use in ICU patients:\nIn ICU patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation, the dosing requirements for atracurium vary significantly between individuals. After prolonged use, spontaneous recovery of neuromuscular function can range from 15 to 75 minutes, necessitating close monitoring and individualized care.\nLaudanosine and risk of seizures:\nLaudanosine, a metabolite of atracurium, has been linked to transient hypotension and, in higher doses, seizures in animal studies. While rare, ICU patients receiving long-term atracurium may experience seizures, particularly if they have predisposing conditions such as head trauma or uremia. Further research is required to identify risk factors and mitigate neurotoxicity.\n[31]\n[32]\n[33]",
    "mechanism": "Atracurium is a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug of the benzylisoquinoline class. As a competitive antagonist of the α subunit of the postsynaptic nicotinic receptor at the neuromuscular junction, it competes with acetylcholine for binding sites. The binding of the postsynaptic nicotinic receptor by atracurium prevents depolarization of the motor endplate and subsequent skeletal muscle contraction. Unlike depolarizing agents, binding atracurium or other non-depolarizing agents does not induce a receptor conformational change.\n[13]\n\nPharmacokinetics\n\nAbsorption:\nAtracurium has an onset of action of approximately 2 minutes when an intubating dose is given. This medication is classified as an intermediate-acting, non-depolarizing muscle relaxant with a duration of action of approximately 40 to 45 minutes. The elimination half-life is approximately 20 minutes. In older patients, the half-life may increase by approximately 15% due primarily to decreased clearance.\n[14]\n\nDistribution:\nThe volume of distribution is approximately 160 mL/kg, and the plasma protein binding is 82%.\n\nMetabolism:\nNon-enzymatic degradation (Hofmann elimination) accounts for 45% of the metabolism of atracurium. Hoffman elimination is a temperature and pH-dependent process slowed by acidosis and hypothermia.\n[15]\nThe remainder is metabolized via ester hydrolysis by non-specific esterases in the plasma that are unrelated to pseudocholinesterase. A drop in pH enhances the rate of ester hydrolysis. Neuromuscular blocking agents of the benzylisoquinoline class are preferred in critically ill patients as their metabolism is unaffected by renal or hepatic dysfunction. A primary metabolite of Hofmann's elimination of atracurium is laudanosine, which has no neuromuscular blocking activity but acts as a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant. Studies have shown that long-term infusions of atracurium in critically ill patients can cause an elevation in laudanosine levels.\n\nElimination:\nLess than 5% of atracurium is excreted in the urine. Laudanosine is hepatically and renally eliminated and has a significantly longer elimination half-life than atracurium (197 minutes).\n[16]\nTherefore, it can potentially accumulate with prolonged atracurium infusion. Animal studies have shown that laudanosine crosses the blood-brain barrier and is detectable in the cerebral spinal fluid. Laudanosine, a metabolite of atracurium, is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier, potentially leading to excitatory effects and seizure activity. In patients undergoing liver transplantation, elevated concentrations of laudanosine are observed, while renal failure further increases plasma levels and prolongs the mean elimination half-life. Laudanosine can cross the placental barrier during pregnancy, with a mean transplacental transfer of approximately 14%. While laudanosine-associated neurotoxicity is generally unlikely in short-term use, prolonged use of atracurium, particularly in intensive care settings, can increase the risk of seizures.\n[16]",
    "administration": "Available Dosage Forms and Strengths\n\nIntravenous atracurium should not be administered intramuscularly due to excessive tissue irritation. Atracurium can be given via bolus or infusion. Studies have demonstrated that continuous infusion is a viable option to achieve a steady state of neuromuscular blockade due to its relatively predictable and organ-independent metabolism. Atracurium besylate infusion solutions can be prepared by mixing the drug with compatible diluents, such as 5% dextrose injection, 0.9% sodium chloride injection, or a combination of 5% dextrose and 0.9% sodium chloride injection.\n\nAdult Dosage\n\nED95 and intubation:\nDoses of\n0.23 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg for adults and children older than 2, 0.3 to 0.4 mg/kg for children younger than 2. In morbidly obese patients, an atracurium dose should be administered based on ideal body weight.\n[17]\n\nInitial dosing and recovery profile:\nThe recommended initial dose of atracurium for nonemergency intubation is 0.4 to 0.5 mg/kg. This dose typically achieves adequate conditions for intubation within 2 to 2.5 minutes, with peak neuromuscular block occurring approximately 3 to 5 minutes post-injection. Under balanced anesthesia, the clinically effective neuromuscular blockade persists for 20 to 35 minutes. Recovery to 25% of baseline neuromuscular function is observed after 35 to 45 minutes, and full recovery (95%) is typically achieved within 60 minutes.\n\nAdjusted dosing in the presence of anesthetic agents:\nIn the presence of isoflurane or enflurane, which potentiates the effects of atracurium, the initial dose should be reduced by approximately one-third to account for enhanced neuromuscular blockade. Only minimal dose reduction may be necessary for halothane, which exerts a marginal potentiating effect (around 20%).\n\nMaintenance dosing for prolonged procedures:\nAtracurium dosages of 0.08 to 0.10 mg/kg are recommended to maintain sustained neuromuscular blockade during extended surgical procedures. The first maintenance dose is typically required 20 to 45 minutes after the initial dose, with subsequent dosing intervals determined by clinical monitoring of neuromuscular function. Maintenance doses may be administered within 25 minutes under balanced anesthesia.\n\nCardiovascular disease or a history of asthma/anaphylactoid reactions:\nTo minimize potential adverse effects, it is recommended that adults, children, or infants with significant cardiovascular conditions or a history suggesting a higher risk for histamine release (eg, severe allergic reactions, asthma) be administered a starting dose of 0.3 to 0.4 mg/kg of atracurium slowly or in divided doses over 1 minute.\n\nNeuromuscular disease, electrolyte imbalances:\nPatients with conditions that may potentiate neuromuscular blockade or complicate reversal, such as neuromuscular disease, severe electrolyte disturbances, or carcinomatosis, may require careful dose adjustments. While there is limited clinical experience in these groups, no specific dosing guidelines are available.\n\nPost-succinylcholine administration:\nFollowing succinylcholine administration for intubation under balanced anesthesia, an initial dose of 0.3 to 0.4 mg/kg of atracurium is recommended for adults. If potent inhalational anesthetics are used, further dose reductions may be needed. Atracurium should only be administered after the effects of succinylcholine have entirely worn off.\n\nContinuous infusion in the operating room:\nFor prolonged surgical procedures, atracurium can be administered by continuous infusion after an initial bolus dosage of 0.3 to 0.5 mg/kg. The infusion rate should be adjusted based on patient response, starting at 9 to 10 μg/kg/min to counteract spontaneous recovery from neuromuscular function. Maintenance rates of 5 to 9 μg/kg/min are generally adequate for most patients.\n\nCardiopulmonary bypass:\nIn patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass with induced hypothermia (25 °C to 28 °C), the required infusion rate of atracurium is approximately half that required during normothermic conditions to maintain adequate muscle relaxation.\n\nUse in the intensive care unit (ICU):\nThe recommended continuous infusion rate for adult patients in ICU settings is between 11 and 13 μg/kg/min, ranging from 4.5 to 29.5 μg/kg/min. Pediatric ICU patients may require higher infusion rates. Dosing may vary over time, and frequent adjustments based on the clinical response are necessary. If a neuromuscular block is lost, a bolus dose may be required to quickly reestablish the block before continuing the infusion.\n\nSpecific Patient Populations\n\nHepatic impairment:\nNo dosage adjustment is required.\n\nRenal impairment:\nNo dosage adjustment is required.\n\nPregnancy considerations:\nAtracurium is a favorable neuromuscular blocking agent for pregnant patients undergoing cesarean sections due to its minimal placental transfer, which reduces fetal exposure compared to other non-depolarizing muscle relaxants. However, the pharmacokinetics of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants may be altered in pregnancy, with increased drug permeability across the placenta in certain pathological conditions. While atracurium does not significantly affect mean arterial pressure, it may induce a notable bradycardic response in pregnant patients, necessitating careful cardiovascular monitoring during administration.\n[18]\nA systematic review shows no significant pharmacokinetic differences between pregnant and non-pregnant women in atracurium.\n[19]\n\nPediatric patients:\nAtracurium dosages generally do not require adjustment for patients aged 2 and older. For infants aged 1 month to 2 years, the suggested starting dose of atracurium besylate is 0.3 to 0.4 mg/kg when used under halothane anesthesia. Safety and efficacy in patients younger than 1 month have not been verified.\n\nOlder patients:\nOlder patients may exhibit slightly altered pharmacokinetics, including a modest decrease in total plasma clearance, which is compensated by an increase in the volume of distribution. These alterations do not significantly differ in the clinical duration or recovery from neuromuscular blockade compared to younger patients. However, caution is advised due to concomitant comorbidities and medications.",
    "adverse_effects": "Most adverse reactions associated with atracurium administration are related to histamine release. Flushing and erythema are the most common adverse effects associated with histamine release related to atracurium administration. Less commonly, more severe adverse effects can occur, including bradycardia, bronchospasm, dyspnea, hypotension, laryngospasm, tachycardia, urticaria, and wheezing. Studies have previously demonstrated that a mean arterial pressure fall of 30 mm Hg can be seen within 2 minutes of administration. Histamine receptor type-1 and type-2 blocking agents have been used to attenuate this hypotensive response effectively. A slower injection speed (ie, 30 to 60 seconds) has also reduced histamine release and the associated adverse effects.\n[20]\n[21]\nAtracurium-induced bronchospasm with a flat capnograph has been reported.\n[22]\n\nDrug-Drug Interactions\n\nInhalational anesthetics:\nThese volatile anesthetics (eg, enflurane, isoflurane, halothane) enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of atracurium, potentially leading to more profound and longer-lasting muscle relaxation. Careful monitoring is essential during anesthesia.\nAminoglycosides and polymyxins:\nAminoglycosides like gentamicin and polymyxins can potentiate the effects of atracurium, impairing neuromuscular transmission and increasing the risk of prolonged paralysis.\n[23]\nLithium:\nLithium may enhance the neuromuscular blocking effects of atracurium, leading to increased muscle weakness or prolonged neuromuscular blockade.\nMagnesium:\nMagnesium can enhance the effects of atracurium by reducing neuromuscular transmission and increasing the intensity and duration of neuromuscular blockade.\nProcainamide:\nProcainamide may potentiate the effects of atracurium by inhibiting neuromuscular transmission, which can lead to prolonged paralysis.\nQuinidine:\nQuinidine can similarly enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of atracurium, increasing the risk of muscle weakness and prolonged paralysis.\n[24]\nSuccinylcholine (depolarizing muscle relaxant):\nAccording to product labeling, succinylcholine administration before atracurium does not extend the duration of the neuromuscular blockade but accelerates its onset and may increase its depth. Recovery from a succinylcholine-induced block is essential before administering atracurium.\nRinger lactate:\nRinger lactate should not be used as a diluent, as atracurium degrades more rapidly in this solution than in a 0.9% sodium chloride solution.",
    "monitoring": "There are several methods to monitor neuromuscular blockade following administration of atracurium. Clinical signs are often used to attempt to determine the depth of neuromuscular blockade, as well as a reversal. These could include eye-opening, sustained handgrip, leg lift, or sustained head lift for longer than 5 seconds. Unfortunately, these are not accurate determinants of the presence or absence of residual neuromuscular blockade. Nerve stimulation is a method frequently used for monitoring neuromuscular blockade intraoperatively. ECG electrodes are applied at the ulnar, facial, or tibial nerve. Then, a \"train-of-four\" stimulation pattern is applied. Four stimuli are applied at the chosen nerve at a frequency of 2 Hz, provoking a twitch response. When atracurium or another non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent is given, there is a reduction in the amplitude of the evoked responses; the final twitch of the train-of-four sequences (T4) is affected first, then the third (T3), followed by the second (T2), then the first (T1). This sequential decrease in twitch height is known as fade. Lack of response in 3 of 4 twitches indicates 90% to 95% blockade.\n\nAs the intensity of the neuromuscular blockade increases, the twitches begin to disappear in the same sequence as the fade occurs. As neuromuscular blockade is reversed, the reverse order is true, with T1 being the first to reappear. The ratio of twitch intensity when comparing T4 to T1 is a significant value; a ratio of 0.9 indicates sufficient neuromuscular blockade reversal.\n[34]\n[35]",
    "toxicity": "Signs and Symptoms of Overdose\n\nIn cases involving atracurium overdose, pharmacological effects are enhanced. Histamine release and cardiovascular effects, such as hypotension, may occur. In pediatric patients, unintentional doses up to 1 mg/kg (5 to 6 times the ED95) lead to delayed recovery (50 to 55 minutes), with minimal cardiovascular changes. In adults, a dose of 1.3 mg/kg results in a prolonged recovery time (83 minutes) and moderate hemodynamic effects, including increased mean arterial pressure and heart rate (13% and 27%, respectively), which persist for about 40 minutes but do not require specific intervention.\n\nManagement of Overdose\n\nThe primary focus in managing an atracurium overdose is ensuring proper airway and ventilation. Emergency medicine physicians maintain manual or mechanical ventilation when necessary. Peripheral nerve stimulation is used to monitor neuromuscular block recovery. Recovery can be enhanced with anticholinesterase agents like neostigmine, edrophonium, or pyridostigmine combined with anticholinergic drugs such as atropine or glycopyrrolate. If cardiovascular support is needed, fluids and vasopressors should be administered. Critical care physicians should closely monitor the patient's hemodynamic status and respiratory function. Due to the potential for prolonged recovery, intensive care support is provided until the patient stabilizes and fully recovers from the neuromuscular block. Lethal self-administration in healthcare providers remains a concern.\n[36]"
