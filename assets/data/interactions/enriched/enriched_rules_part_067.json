Blood glucose should be closely monitored whenever quinolones are prescribed to patients receiving insulin or other antidiabetic agents, especially if they are elderly or have renal impairment. Patients should learn to recognize the symptoms of hypoglycemia such as headache, dizziness, drowsiness, nervousness, confusion, tremor, hunger, weakness, perspiration, palpitation, and tachycardia. If hypo- or hyperglycemia occur during quinolone therapy, patients should initiate appropriate remedial therapy immediately, discontinue the antibiotic, and contact their physician.",

      "effect": "Beta-blockers may antagonize the effects of beta-2 adrenergic bronchodilators and precipitate acute, life-threatening bronchospasm in patients with asthma or other obstructive airway diseases. The mechanism involves increased airway resistance and reduced bronchodilation due to blockade of beta-2 adrenergic receptors. The interaction may also occur with ophthalmically applied beta-blockers, which are systemically absorbed and can produce clinically significant systemic effects even at low or undetectable plasma levels. Due to opposing effects on beta-2 adrenergic receptors, propranolol has been used in the treatment of albuterol overdose. Likewise, beta-2 adrenergic agonists may interfere with the pharmacologic effects of beta-blockers.",
      "management_text": "Concomitant use of beta-2 adrenergic bronchodilators with beta-blockers, including ophthalmic formulations, should generally be avoided. If coadministration is required, a cardioselective beta-blocker (e.g., acebutolol, atenolol, betaxolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol, nebivolol) is usually preferred. Nevertheless, caution is advised and respiratory status should be closely monitored, as cardioselectivity is not absolute and larger doses of beta-1 selective agents may pose some of the same risks as nonselective agents. In general, nonselective beta-blockers are considered contraindicated in patients with obstructive airways disease.",

      "effect": "The efficacy of insulin and other antidiabetic agents may be diminished by certain drugs, including atypical antipsychotics, corticosteroids, diuretics, estrogens, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, human growth hormone, phenothiazines, progestins, protease inhibitors, sympathomimetic amines, thyroid hormones, L-asparaginase, alpelisib, copanlisib, danazol, diazoxide, isoniazid, megestrol, omacetaxine, phenytoin, tagraxofusp, temsirolimus, as well as pharmacologic dosages of nicotinic acid and adrenocorticotropic agents. These drugs may interfere with blood glucose control because they can cause hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, new-onset diabetes mellitus, and/or exacerbation of preexisting diabetes.",
      "management_text": "Close clinical monitoring of glycemic control is recommended following initiation or discontinuation of these drugs, and the dosages of concomitant antidiabetic agents adjusted as necessary. Patients should be advised to notify their physician if their blood glucose is consistently high or if they experience symptoms of severe hyperglycemia such as excessive thirst and increases in the volume or frequency of urination.",
