For patients who are already receiving an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor with anticholinergic agents, every attempt should be made to discontinue the latter or substitute them with less anticholinergic alternatives. Caution is required, however, since anticholinergic withdrawal may occur. Seizures have been reported following abrupt discontinuation of anticholinergics during acetylcholinesterase inhibitor therapy.', 'Antagonism', 'Anticholinergic agents should generally be avoided in patients with Alzheimer''s disease or other cognitive impairment, regardless of whether they are receiving an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.', NULL, NULL, 'Moderate', 'pharmacodynamic');
