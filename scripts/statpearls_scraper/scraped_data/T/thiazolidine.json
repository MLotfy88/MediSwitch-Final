    "indications": "Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem. Resistance exists for all known antibiotics, and multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens are becoming more common.\n[1]\n[2]\nThere are fewer new antimicrobials in the pipeline to combat antimicrobials that have developed resistance.\n[3]\nGram-negative bacteria have developed the broadest spectrum of resistance due to multiple structural adaptations and antibiotic degradation enzymes called beta-lactamases.\n[4]\nSome of these antibiotic degradation enzymes include extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL), which are enzymes that hydrolyze penicillins, third-generation cephalosporins, and monobactams; AmpC beta-lactamases, which can hydrolyze most penicillins, a wide array of cephalosporins, and most beta-lactam beta-lactamase combinations; and carbapenemases, which can hydrolyze carbapenems and a wide variety of other beta-lactams.\n[4]\n[5]\nThe presence of each of these has significant implications for antimicrobial selection.\n\nCarbapenemase-producing\nEnterobacterales\n(CRE) are of particular concern as they either possess a carbapenemase, a beta-lactamase capable of hydrolyzing antibiotics in the carbapenem class, or display resistance to a carbapenem in which the organism is not intrinsically resistant.\n[6]\n[4]\nCarbapenems are broad-spectrum and are typically reserved for treating MDR pathogens.\n[7]\nStructurally, carbapenems are similar to penicillins but have the addition of a pyrroline ring.\n[8]\nBoth antibiotics degrade the bacterial cell wall at the penicillin-binding protein via a beta-lactam ring; however, adding a pyrroline ring protects the beta-lactam ring from some degrading enzymes produced by the bacterium.\n[8]\nCRE have developed resistance mechanisms against carbapenems, which has severe implications for the individual patient and hospital epidemiology.\n[4]\n\nSpecialized knowledge is required when diagnosing, treating, and preventing CRE infections. Antimicrobial resistance is a dynamic and rapidly changing topic, and staying informed on the latest data regarding resistance is imperative to maintain excellent patient care. Maintaining excellent antimicrobial stewardship practices is imperative to decreasing rates of CRE in our communities.\n[9]\nBacteria may have multiple resistance mechanisms to carbapenems, but the most common is carbapenemase enzyme production.\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\nThese carbapenemase-producing carbapenem-resistant\nEnterobacterales\nuse diverse mechanisms to degrade antibiotics.\n[6]\nOther resistance mechanisms include increased efflux pump action and specific porin blocking at the bacterial cell membrane to limit the antibiotics' permeability, rendering them ineffective as they cannot access the bacterial cell.\n[4]",
    "mechanism": "Beta-lactamases are commonly grouped according to the Ambler classification system.\n[13]\nBeta-lactamases in different classifications work via differing mechanisms.\n[14]\nCarbapenemase enzymes can be categorized into Ambler classes A, B, and D. (see\nImage.\nCarbapenemase Ambler Classes).\n[13]\n\nClass A Carbapenemases\n\nThe most common class A carbapenemases include\nKlebsiella pneumoniae\ncarbapenemase (KPC), imipenem-hydrolysing beta-lactamase (IMI), non-metallo carbapenemase of class A (NMC-A), Guyana extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (GES), and\nSerratia marscescens\nenzyme (SME).\n[14]\nClass A carbapenemases possess a serine amino acid at their binding sites and are characterized by their ability to hydrolyze penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, and aztreonam.\n[14]\nKPC is the most prevalent carbapenemase gene amongst all carbapenemase-producing CRE and is the most commonly found in the United States.\n[14]\n[15]\n\nClass B Carbapenemases\n\nClass B is defined by metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) structures.\n[14]\nThis class possesses amino acids in the binding site that bind to zinc.\n[16]\nThese enzymes include NDM (New Delhi metallo-lactamase), IMP (Imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas), and VIM (Verona integron-encoded metallo-lactamase).\n[14]\nMost class B carbapenemases hydrolyze all beta-lactams except for aztreonam.\n[16]\nThese carbapenemases are usually found on plasmid vectors and other transposable elements, allowing them to spread between bacteria.\n[16]\nDue to a high sequence variability of 15% to 70%, these enzymes are difficult to detect with molecular testing, slowing investigations to more fully understand their prevalence.\n[15]\n\nClass D Carbapenemases\n\nOxacillin-hydrolyzing carbapenemase (OXA) enzymes make up class D carbapenemases.\n[14]\nLike class A carbapenemases, class D carbapenemases also include a serine amino acid at their binding sites.\n[14]\nThey differ from class A carbapenemases as they have decreased hydrolyzing activity against carbapenems and penicillins, have no activity against extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and are not inhibited by older beta-lactamase inhibitors (eg, clavulanic acid, tazobactam, or sulbactam).\n[14]\n[17]\n[18]\n[17]\nHowever, most are inhibited by avibactam.\n[17]\nThese genes are genetically similar to ESBL genes, thus making them difficult to differentiate from other ESBL producers on molecular testing.\n[12]\nOXA-48 is the most common isolate in this class and is typically found in\nKlebsiella pneumoniae\n.",
    "monitoring": "Phenotypic diagnosis requires bacterial culture and identification.\n[14]\nDisk diffusion, E-test, or automated susceptibility testing is done to identify the carbapenem resistance phenotype.\n[14]\nDetermining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for carbapenems allows one to ascertain carbapenem resistance by comparing it to predetermined carbapenem breakpoints.\n[14]\nThe drawbacks of this process include the time required to perform this testing, usually several days, and the limited information obtained on specific resistance mechanisms.\n[14]\nThis becomes particularly relevant as although the MIC for carbapenems may fall within the susceptible range, a carbapenemase could still be present.\n[14]\nIf an isolate is suspected of harboring a carbapenemase due to susceptibility patterns, this should be confirmed with molecular testing.\n[14]\n\nAnother commonly employed phenotypic test is chromogenic media, which reacts and turns color in the presence of resistance enzymes produced by CRE.\n[14]\n[38]\nThe Carba NP is also a cost-effective testing modality recommended for carbapenemase detection in\nEnterobacterales\n.\n[14]\nPerforming the test typically takes a few minutes to 2 hours and has high sensitivity and specificity.\n[14]\nMatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) is the newer technology for identifying CRE.\n[14]\nThis technique uses laser ionization of bacterial proteins to determine their molecular weight and create a proteomic profile.\n[14]\nHydrolysis of carbapenems can be detected via a change in the molecular weight of the compounds, which can be detected by MALDI-TOF and extrapolated to identify CRE status.\n[38]\nThis method is demonstrated to have 98.9% and 97.1% sensitivity and specificity, respectively.\n[38]\nCost, lack of access to MALDI-TOF units, and relative newness of this method are the most significant barriers to further utilization of this diagnostic modality.\n[14]\nThe modified Hodge test, which detects the amount of carbapenem left in agar in the presence of a suspected carbapenemase producer, is no longer uniformly recommended as it has a low sensitivity for MBL-producing bacteria and has a high rate of both false positives and false negatives.\n[14]\n\nMolecular identification can be performed in hours and quickly determine the type of resistance mechanism involved.\n[14]\nHowever, this method indicates the presence of a resistance gene and does not give susceptibility testing results.\n[14]\nEarly detection of CRE infections helps to narrow down the best treatments and decrease the likelihood of spreading the infection. The most common modality of detection is multiplex PCR and microarray technologies.\n[14]\nMultiple PCR panels are commercially available.\n[14]\nAlthough these tests quickly determine the presence of pre-selected resistance genes, not all genes that confer resistance are available on these panels, and they are not used extensively due to the cost of these tests.\n[14]\n\nThe decision on which testing modality to employ is determined by the resources of the individual laboratory and the clinical picture, which determines the urgency of diagnosis. Available susceptibilities typically suggest CRE, and confirmatory testing, such as a Carba NP test or molecular identification, is employed for further information. In more critical situations, a combination of phenotypic and molecular identification tests can be utilized simultaneously so empiric therapy can be appropriately tailored once susceptibility testing is available.",
    "administration": "Treatment of CRE depends on the infection site, the isolated pathogen, the resistance profile, and species-specific native resistances (see\nTable\n.\nIntrinsic Drug Resistance). Due to the complexity and variability of possible treatments, plans should be driven by\nin vitro\nsusceptibility testing.\n[39]\nThe duration of therapy should be directed by guidelines relating to the specific infection being treated. Additionally, infectious disease specialists and microbiologists should be consulted for further recommendations. Antibiotics that may have activity against CRE include carbapenems, cefiderocol, a siderophore cephalosporin, polymyxins, aminoglycosides, tigecycline, fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors (BLBLI).\n[40]\n[41]\n[40]\n\nUncomplicated Cystitis\n\nFor uncomplicated cystitis, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin,  a dose of an aminoglycoside, or a fluoroquinolone (eg, ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) are recommended if susceptible.\n[40]\nFosfomycin could be considered in\nE. coli\nCRE isolates.\n[40]\nIf meropenem MIC is ≤1 and carbapenemase testing is negative or unavailable, meropenem can be used as it is unlikely that a carbapenemase is present when meropenem susceptibility is preserved.\n[40]\nIf other agents are resistant and the isolate is not susceptible to meropenem or a carbapenemase is present, other agents such as ceftazidime-avibactam, imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam, cefiderocol, or meropenem-vaborbactam should be used, guided by susceptibility testing.\n[40]\nColistin should be considered if no other option is available.\n[40]\n\nComplicated Urinary Tract Infections\n\nComplicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) with CRE usually affect patients with recurrent UTIs who have had repeated exposure to multiple antibiotics. Susceptibility and urine drug concentrations should drive effective antibiotic therapy. Fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are preferred therapies for cUTI if susceptible.\n[40]\nIn isolates with a meropenem MIC ≤1, extended infusion meropenem may be considered in isolates without a carbapenemase or when carbapenemase testing is unavailable.\n[40]\nOtherwise, other agents such as ceftazidime-avibactam, imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam, cefiderocol, or meropenem-vaborbactam should be used, as guided by susceptibility testing.\n[40]\nAminoglycoside therapy could additionally be considered while monitoring for nephrotoxicity.\n[40]\n\nInfections Outside the Urinary Tract\n\nInfections outside the urinary tract with meropenem MICs ≤1, no carbapenemase noted, or no carbapenemase testing is unavailable should be treated with extended-infusion meropenem.\n[40]\nIf the meropenem cannot be used, ceftazidime-avibactam therapy is recommended.\n[40]\n\nIn meropenem-resistant infections, ceftazidime-avibactam, imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam, or meropenem-vaborbactam can be used.\n[40]\nIf the patient has received medical care in an area of the world that has a high prevalence of metallo-beta-lactamases or has been previously infected or colonized, either ceftazidime-avibactam plus aztreonam or cefiderocol is recommended if carbapenemase testing is unavailable due to increased risk for a metallo-beta-lactamase.\n[40]\nPreviously, combination therapy with polymixins and aminoglycosides was recommended, but this is no longer recommended due to the severe nephrotoxicity of this regimen.\n[40]\nEffective BLBLIs and cefiderocol have been developed that have better side effect profiles.\n[40]\n\nCarbapenemase-producing\nEnterobacterales\n\nFor carbapenemase-producing isolates outside of the urinary tract, the recommended treatment differs based on the carbapenemase present. For KPC isolates, either ceftazidime-avibactam, imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam, or meropenem-vaborbactam is recommended.\n[40]\nHowever, for metallo-beta-lactamase producers, cefiderocol or ceftazidime-avibactam plus aztreonam is recommended.\n[40]\nBLBLIs (eg, ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, and imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam) are ineffective against metallo-beta-lactamase producers.\n[40]\nConversely, aztreonam is typically effective.\n[40]\nCombining treatment with ceftazidime-avibactam and aztreonam is recommended as ESBL-producing isolates and OXA-48-like carbapenemases often coexist in metallo-beta-lactamase producers.\n[40]\nFor OXA-48-like carbapenemases, ceftazidime-avibactam is preferred, with cefiderocol as an alternative agent.\n[40]\n\nTigecycline and eravacycline could be considered alternative agents in patients with isolates that are not susceptible to beta-lactams or have contraindications to them.\n[40]\nStill, they should not be used as monotherapy for bloodstream infections or urinary infections due to low serum and urinary concentrations.\n[40]\nAdditionally, tigecycline has been shown to have increased mortality when used for monotherapy for severe infections.\n[42]\nColistin and other polymixins are not recommended for infections other than uncomplicated cystitis.\n[40]",
    "adverse_effects": "Complications that result from antibiotic resistance include severe illnesses, adverse effects secondary to medical treatments, and death. A complicating factor during the diagnosis and treatment of CRE infections is identifying resistance to previously discussed drug regimens. Commonly induced resistance mechanisms in CRE to other active antimicrobials include aminoglycosides, fosfomycin, and BLBLI. Acquiring a single-point mutation in the 16S rRNA methyltransferase leads to resistance of all aminoglycosides.\n[44]\nThis mutation can occur\nde novo\nor in combination with other resistance mechanisms and is best studied in NDM carbapenemase-producing CRE but can also be present in many other carbapenemase producers.\n[45]\nThis mutation can develop in the setting of aminoglycoside use and confers resistance. Fosfomycin resistance is common in\nE.coli,\nbut many other\nEnterobacterales\n, including ESBL and CRE, do not demonstrate resistance. The development of resistance makes treating these infections more challenging. Resistance to this drug is typically seen by selecting resistant microbes through fosfomycin monotherapy.\n[46]\nCeftazidime-avibactam is generally used for OXA-48 and KPC CRE, but when resistance appears among these isolates, mutations in\nbla\nOxa48\nand\nbla\nKPC\ninduce resistance, respectively.\n[47]"
