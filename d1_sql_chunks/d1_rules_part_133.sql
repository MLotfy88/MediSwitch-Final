Theoretically, coadministration with other agents that can prolong the QT interval including tricyclic antidepressants and other antidepressants (e.g., trazodone) may result in additive effects and increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes and sudden death. Concomitant use of agents with serotonergic activity including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and other antidepressants may potentiate the risk of serotonin syndrome, which is a rare but serious and potentially fatal condition thought to result from hyperstimulation of brainstem 5-HT1A and 2A receptors.', NULL, 'The use of citalopram is not recommended in patients receiving other drugs that prolong the QT interval.', NULL, 'The use of citalopram is not recommended in patients receiving other drugs that prolong the QT interval.

However, if treatment with citalopram is required in these patients, the labeling recommends that the dosage not exceed 40 mg/day, as higher dosages may have an excessive effect on the QT interval and confer no additional benefit in the treatment of depression. In general, the concomitant use of multiple serotonergic agents should be avoided if possible, or otherwise approached with caution if potential benefit is deemed to outweigh the risk. Patients should be closely monitored for symptoms of the serotonin syndrome during treatment. Particular caution is advised when increasing the dosages of these agents. If serotonin syndrome develops or is suspected during the course of therapy, all serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately and supportive care rendered as necessary.
