Because the formation of hepatic CYP450 enzymes is down-regulated during infection and chronic inflammation by increased levels of certain cytokines (e.g., interleukins-1, -6, and -10; tumor necrosis factor alpha; interferons), treatment targeting these cytokines may restore or normalize CYP450 enzyme levels resulting in increased metabolism of these drugs.', 'DDInter', 'Caution is advised when treatments targeting cytokines such as interleukins, tumor necrosis factors, or interferons are prescribed to patients receiving concomitant drugs that are CYP450 substrates, particularly those with narrow therapeutic ranges (e.g., antiarrhythmics, anticonvulsants, immunosuppressants, theophylline) or sensitive substrates where decreases in plasma levels may be significant or undesirable (e.g., oral contraceptives, statins, benzodiazepines, opioids). Clinical and/or laboratory monitoring should be considered following the initiation or withdrawal of such treatments, and the dosage(s) of the CYP450 substrate(s) adjusted accordingly.
