Postganglionic adrenergic blocking agents such as guanadrel, guanethidine, and rauwolfia alkaloids work by depleting catecholamine stores from adrenergic nerve endings. Therefore, they may sensitize adrenergic receptors to direct-acting sympathomimetics, but blunt the effects of indirect-acting agents whose activity is mediated through the release of catecholamines.",
