Symptoms of the excitatory reaction may include agitation, headache, diaphoresis, hyperpyrexia, flushing, shivering, myoclonus, rigidity, tremor, diarrhea, hypertension, tachycardia, seizures, and coma. The exact mechanism of interaction is unknown, but may involve excessive serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (i.e., serotonin syndrome). The interaction is unpredictable and has been reported primarily with meperidine or fentanyl and various MAOIs including phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid, moclobemide, and selegiline. Fatal hyperpyrexia and hypertension have also been observed in animal studies with meperidine and phenelzine or furazolidone.

Symptoms of the excitatory reaction may include agitation, headache, diaphoresis, hyperpyrexia, flushing, shivering, myoclonus, rigidity, tremor, diarrhea, hypertension, tachycardia, seizures, and coma. The exact mechanism of interaction is unknown, but may involve excessive serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (i.e., serotonin syndrome). The interaction is unpredictable and has been reported primarily with meperidine or fentanyl and various MAOIs including phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid, moclobemide, and selegiline. Fatal hyperpyrexia and hypertension have also been observed in animal studies with meperidine and phenelzine or furazolidone.

There appear to be two types of interaction, an excitatory and a depressive one. Symptoms of the excitatory reaction may include agitation, headache, diaphoresis, hyperpyrexia, flushing, shivering, myoclonus, rigidity, tremor, diarrhea, hypertension, tachycardia, seizures, and coma. The exact mechanism of interaction is unknown, but may involve excessive serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (i.e., serotonin syndrome). The interaction is unpredictable and has been reported primarily with meperidine or fentanyl and various MAOIs including phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid, moclobemide, and selegiline. Fatal hyperpyrexia and hypertension have also been observed in animal studies with meperidine and phenelzine or furazolidone. In contrast, symptoms of the depressive reaction probably stem from potentiation of CNS effects by MAOIs and include respiratory depression, cyanosis, hypotension, and coma.', NULL, 'Meperidine and fentanyl should not be used with MAOIs or other agents that possess MAOI activity (e.', NULL, 'Meperidine and fentanyl should not be used with MAOIs or other agents that possess MAOI activity (e.g., furazolidone, linezolid, methylene blue, procarbazine). Some manufacturers of MAOIs also contraindicate the concomitant use of propoxyphene and methadone due to their possible serotonergic effects. At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of MAOI therapy and initiation of treatment with these opioids.
