The interaction is not expected to occur with low doses (e.g., low-dose aspirin) or intermittent short-term administration of NSAIDs.', 'Antagonism', 'Patients receiving angiotensin II receptor antagonists who require prolonged (greater than 1 week) concomitant therapy with an NSAID should have blood pressure monitored more closely following initiation, discontinuation, or change of dosage of the NSAID.', 'Moderate', 'pharmacodynamic', NULL, 'https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/294182/', '', 'Rabeprazole, Misoprostol, Chondroitin sulfate, Glucosamine, Esomeprazole', 'Sacubitril', 1767369485);
