The interval depends on the dosage, duration, and route of corticosteroid therapy administered, but may be at least 3 months in most cases of systemic corticosteroid use. In patients who have recently been vaccinated, high-dose corticosteroid therapy should not be initiated for at least 2 weeks. Household contacts of immunosuppressed patients should also not be vaccinated. However, there are no absolute contraindications to vaccination if a high-risk exposure has occurred. In an outbreak emergency, smallpox vaccine is generally recommended for all persons, regardless of medical conditions.
