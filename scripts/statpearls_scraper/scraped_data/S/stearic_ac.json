    "indications": "Muscle energy is a very safe technique, and it can be utilized outside of medical emergencies or very severe injuries (such as the following examples):\n\nBroken bone\nRuptured ligament/tendon/muscle\nJoint infection\nNo somatic dysfunction present\nPatient refusal",
    "clinical_significance": "Osteopathic manipulative treatment is an underutilized non-surgical alternative that can provide significant benefits to patients with somatic dysfunctions of the AC and SC Joints. As mentioned before, non-surgical approaches are best for AC injuries type I and II, and there is still dispute over types III and V. All non-surgical approaches should be exhausted prior to surgery, and muscle energy is a viable option to treat these non-surgical injuries while benefiting the surrounding stabilizing structures as well.",
    "monitoring": "Communication about patient progression is essential. Treatment by an osteopathic physician requires continual monitoring and progress communicated to the patient's primary physician or orthopedist."
