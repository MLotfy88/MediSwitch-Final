    "indications": "Absolute and relative contraindications must be identified and evaluated during the preprocedure assessment to minimize the risk of complications. These contraindications are summarized in\nTable 1.\n\nTable\nTable 1. Contraindications to the Bier block (IVRA).",
    "clinical_significance": "Bier blocks are widely used, providing safe, effective, and cost-efficient anesthesia for short-duration extremity surgeries in various environments.\n\nEfficiency:\nRapid onset, simple equipment, potential to avoid postoperative care unit stays\nSafety:\nLow risk when standardized protocols are followed\nComfort:\nForearm techniques and adjuncts reduce pain and sedation needs\nAdaptability:\nUsed in outpatient clinics, emergency departments, ambulatory surgery centers, and low-resource settings\n\nKetorolac is well supported as an adjunct to reduce postoperative pain. Broader use of IVRA may depend on ongoing trials confirming the safety of other agents like dexmedetomidine. Advances in monitoring, pharmacokinetics, and tourniquet technology will likely offer further improvements. Focusing on safety, role clarity, and standardized checklists underpins ongoing excellence in Bier block practice. Although local anesthesia systemic toxicity and methemoglobinemia are rare, knowledge and readiness for treatment are essential."
