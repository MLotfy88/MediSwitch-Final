Theoretically, coadministration with other agents that can prolong the QT interval such as macrolide and ketolide antibiotics may result in additive effects and increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias including torsade de pointes and sudden death. Coadministration with certain macrolide or ketolide antibiotics may significantly increase the oral bioavailability of tacrolimus. The proposed mechanism is inhibition of tacrolimus metabolism via intestinal CYP450 3A4. Inhibition of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux transporter in gut wall may also contribute.', NULL, 'Caution is advised when tacrolimus is used with macrolide or ketolide antibiotics that significantly inhibit CYP450 3A4 such as clarithromycin, erythromycin, josamycin, and telithromycin.', NULL, 'Caution is advised when tacrolimus is used with macrolide or ketolide antibiotics that significantly inhibit CYP450 3A4 such as clarithromycin, erythromycin, josamycin, and telithromycin. A preemptive dosage reduction for tacrolimus may be appropriate in some cases. Frequent monitoring of tacrolimus whole blood levels should be performed during and after discontinuation of macrolide antibiotic therapy, and the tacrolimus dosage adjusted accordingly. In addition, patients should be closely monitored for development of serious adverse effects such as nephrotoxicity, lymphoma and other malignancies, infections, diabetes, neurotoxicity (tremor, paraesthesia, encephalopathy, delirium, coma), hyperkalemia, QT prolongation, myocardial hypertrophy, and hypertension. Patients should be advised to seek prompt medical attention if they experience symptoms that could indicate the occurrence of torsade de pointes such as dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, palpitation, irregular heart rhythm, shortness of breath, or syncope.', 'Metabolism, Synergism', NULL, NULL, 'Major', NULL, 'DDInter', 'pharmacodynamic', 1767317476);
