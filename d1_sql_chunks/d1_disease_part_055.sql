The risk appears highest in older patients (particularly older women) but it is not possible to predict which patients are likely to develop TD; whether antipsychotic drugs differ in their potential to cause TD is unknown.  The risk of TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible increase with the duration of therapy and the total cumulative dose.  The syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods, even at low dosages; it may also occur after discontinuation of therapy.  TD may remit (partially or completely) upon discontinuation of antipsychotic therapy, although antipsychotic therapy itself may suppress (or partially suppress) signs/symptoms of TD, possibly masking the underlying process; the effect of symptomatic suppression on the long-term course of TD is unknown.  In patients with preexisting drug-induced TD, initiating or increasing the dosage of antipsychotic therapy may temporarily mask the symptoms of TD but could eventually worsen the condition.  In patients requiring chronic therapy, the lowest dose and shortest duration of therapy producing a satisfactory clinical response are recommended; the need for continued therapy should be reassessed periodically.

Acute thrombocytopenia can occur in patients receiving heparin, with a reported incidence of up to 30%.  Platelet counts should be obtained before and periodically during heparin administration, including regular and repeated use of heparin flush solutions if given for longer than 5 days.  Mild thrombocytopenia with counts above 100,000/mm3 may remain stable or reverse despite continued heparin administration.  However, thrombocytopenia of any degree should be closely monitored.  Therapy should be discontinued if the count falls below 100,000/mm3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, and an alternative, nonheparin anticoagulant (e.g., argatroban, bivalirudin, lepirudin) administered if necessary.  Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction resulting from irreversible aggregation of platelets.  HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT).  Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT, and may include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal artery thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death.  Both HIT and HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy.  Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin should be evaluated for HIT and HITT.  Following an episode, any future use of heparin should be avoided, and use of low-molecular weight heparin should consider the potential for cross-reactivity with the HIT antibody and approached with extreme caution, if not otherwise contraindicated.', '3', 'Bell WR, Royall RM "Heparin-associated thrombocytopenia: a comparison of three heparin preparations."

Acute thrombocytopenia can occur in patients receiving heparin, with a reported incidence of up to 30%.

HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT).  Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT, and may include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal artery thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death.  Both HIT and HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy.

Acute thrombocytopenia can occur in patients receiving heparin, with a reported incidence of up to 30%.  Platelet counts should be obtained before and periodically during heparin administration, including regular and repeated use of heparin flush solutions if given for longer than 5 days.  Mild thrombocytopenia with counts above 100,000/mm3 may remain stable or reverse despite continued heparin administration.  However, thrombocytopenia of any degree should be closely monitored.  Therapy should be discontinued if the count falls below 100,000/mm3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, and an alternative, nonheparin anticoagulant (e.g., argatroban, bivalirudin, lepirudin) administered if necessary.  Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction resulting from irreversible aggregation of platelets.  HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT).  Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT, and may include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal artery thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death.  Both HIT and HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy.  Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin should be evaluated for HIT and HITT.  Following an episode, any future use of heparin should be avoided, and use of low-molecular weight heparin should consider the potential for cross-reactivity with the HIT antibody and approached with extreme caution, if not otherwise contraindicated.', '3', 'Bell WR, Royall RM "Heparin-associated thrombocytopenia: a comparison of three heparin preparations."

The loss of other electrolytes such as phosphate, bromide and iodide is usually slight.  Potassium and magnesium depletion may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.  Other electrolyte-related complications include metabolic alkalosis and hyponatremia, which are rarely life-threatening.  Therapy with thiazide diuretics should be administered cautiously in patients with or predisposed to fluid and electrolyte depletion, including patients with primary or secondary aldosteronism (may have low potassium levels); those with severe or prolonged diarrhea or vomiting; and those with poor nutritional status.  Fluid and electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected prior to initiating therapy, and blood pressure as well as serum electrolyte concentrations monitored periodically and maintained at normal ranges during therapy.  Patients should be advised to immediately report signs and symptoms of fluid or electrolyte imbalance, including dry mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, arrhythmia, or gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting.  Digitalized patients and patients with a history of ventricular arrhythmias should be monitored carefully, since development of hypokalemia may be particularly dangerous in these patients.

The loss of other electrolytes such as phosphate, bromide and iodide is usually slight.  Potassium and magnesium depletion may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.  Other electrolyte-related complications include metabolic alkalosis and hyponatremia, which are rarely life-threatening.  Therapy with thiazide diuretics should be administered cautiously in patients with or predisposed to fluid and electrolyte depletion, including patients with primary or secondary aldosteronism (may have low potassium levels); those with severe or prolonged diarrhea or vomiting; and those with poor nutritional status.  Fluid and electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected prior to initiating therapy, and blood pressure as well as serum electrolyte concentrations monitored periodically and maintained at normal ranges during therapy.  Patients should be advised to immediately report signs and symptoms of fluid or electrolyte imbalance, including dry mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, arrhythmia, or gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting.  Digitalized patients and patients with a history of ventricular arrhythmias should be monitored carefully, since development of hypokalemia may be particularly dangerous in these patients.

In fact, when vaccines are administered during the course of a minor illness, the risk of adverse events is not increased, and serum antibody response is not often diminished.

Other common symptoms that may indicate retinopathy include nyctalopia, photophobia, blurred distance vision, difficulty reading or seeing (e.g., words or letters disappearing or parts of objects missing; misty vision; fog before the eyes), and missing or blacked out areas in the central or peripheral visual field.
