    "indications": "There are few if any, absolute contraindications to the use of modafinil. However, the following is a list of relative contraindications, cautions, and special considerations:\n\nDermatological reaction: If a serious rash including Stevens-Johnson syndrome develops, discontinue modafinil at the first sign of rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related.\nAngioedema and Anaphylaxis Reactions: If suspected, discontinue modafinil.\nMultiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions: If suspected, discontinue modafinil.\nPersistent Sleepiness: Monitor patients frequently for a degree of sleepiness and, if appropriate, recommend patients avoid engaging or driving in any other potentially dangerous activity.\nCardiovascular disease: In patients with preexisting cardiovascular conditions, consider increased monitoring. Modafinil is not recommended in patients with documented left-ventricular hypertrophy or a history of previous cardiotoxicity related to psychostimulant use. It should be used with caution in patients with uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina, or recent myocardial infarction.\nPsychiatric disorders: Modafinil should be used with caution in patients with a history of psychosis and/or mania. Such patients should be monitored for hallucinations, delusions, mania, aggression, and suicidal ideation upon starting modafinil. Discontinuation is advised if these symptoms develop.\nTic disorders: Limited evidence suggests that all central nervous system stimulants may exacerbate tics in patients with pre-existing tic disorders. A baseline assessment of tics is recommended before initiating treatment.\n[21]",
    "mechanism": "Modafinil is known to be a weak inhibitor of dopamine reuptake, which may be its primary clinically important property. It has little to no\nin vivo\naffinity for the serotonin (5HT) or norepinephrine (NE) transporters. However, elevated concentrations of NE and 5HT in the prefrontal cortex and hypothalamus have been observed following modafinil administration, possibly as an indirect effect of increased extracellular dopamine. Modafinil exists as a racemic mixture of S- and R-enantiomers. The R-enantiomer is thought to be the source of modafinil’s psychotropic properties and is marketed independently as armodafinil.\n[12]\n\nAdditionally, modafinil has been postulated to increase signaling in the hypothalamic orexin and histamine neurotransmitter pathways,\n[13]\nand animal studies have also suggested a glutamatergic effect.\n[14]\nA potential advantage of modafinil is its very low observed propensity for causing euphoric effects associated with traditional psychostimulants (e.g., cocaine, amphetamine). This has been attributed to differences in its interaction with the dopamine transporter at the molecular level.\n[15]\nIn several laboratory studies of healthy subjects, modafinil has also been shown to reduce the euphoric effects of cocaine.\n[16]\n[17]\n\nPharmacokinetics\n\nAbsorption: Modafinil is readily absorbed after oral administration. It is insoluble in an aqueous solution and therefore cannot be administered intravenously. Maximum plasma concentration is reached 2 to 4 hours after administration.\n\nMetabolism: Modafinil undergoes hepatic metabolism via multiple pathways, including cytochrome (CYP) CYP3A4. 80% of the dose is recovered in the urine in the form of metabolites.\n\nElimination: The elimination half-life of a single dose in healthy subjects is approximately 15 hours.\n[18]\nSevere renal and/or hepatic impairment is known to cause significantly increased steady-state drug concentrations. Dose reduction is recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment.",
    "administration": "Modafinil is available exclusively in the form of 100 mg and 200 mg oral tablets; the usual dose is 200 mg once daily. It is classified as a control substance class IV drug.\n\nAdult Dosing\n\nThe recommended dose of modafinil tablets in the treatment of narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea is  200 mg orally administered once a day in the morning. For the treatment of shift work disorder, modafinil 200 mg once a day is taken about one hour before the start of the work shift.\n\nSpecific Patient Population\n\nPediatric use\n: Effectiveness and safety in pediatric patients are not established. Modafinil is not United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for use in the pediatric population for any indication. Serious skin rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and erythema multiforme major, have been reported with modafinil use in pediatric patients.\n\nGeriatric use:\nIn older patients, modafinil and metabolite elimination might be reduced, so consider using lower doses and closely monitor patients.\n\nPregnancy:\nModafinil potentially increases the risk of congenital malformations (including congenital heart defects, hypospadias, and orofacial clefts); modafinil should not be used in pregnancy, and alternative treatment options for narcolepsy should be considered\n\nLactating women:\nIt is unknown if modafinil is excreted in breast milk. Use with caution, especially if the newborn infant is exclusively breastfed.\n[19]\n\nHepatic impairment:\nIn patients with severe hepatic impairment, modafinil dose should be reduced by one-half of the usual dosage indicated for the patients. A dose reduction to a maximum of 100 mg daily is recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\n\nRenal Impairment:\nModafinil should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment. However, no recommendations for renal dosing exist.",
    "adverse_effects": "Modafinil is generally a well-tolerated stimulant. The most commonly reported adverse effects of modafinil (less than 10% of users) are headache, nausea, and decreased appetite. Other commonly reported adverse effects (5% to 10% of users) include anxiety, insomnia, dizziness, diarrhea, and rhinitis.\n[1]\nRegarding serious adverse effects, cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms have been reported in postmarketing surveillance. These life-threatening rashes associated with modafinil appear extremely rare, although the precise incidence rates are not known. Most of the reported cases have occurred within six weeks of drug initiation. Therefore, any patient who develops a rash during this time frame is advised to notify the prescribing physician immediately.\n[20]\n\nAbuse Potential\n: In clinical trials, modafinil use produces euphoric and psychoactive effects, altering thinking, mood, feelings, and perception like other central nervous system stimulants. Assess the risk of potential abuse and use it with caution in patients with a history of drug abuse.\n\nWithdrawal:\nIn one placebo-controlled clinical trial, after nine weeks of modafinil use, the effects of modafinil withdrawal were observed. No withdrawal symptoms were observed in patients with modafinil treatment cessation during 14 days of observation, but in patients with narcolepsy, sleepiness returned.",
    "monitoring": "There is no requirement for specific monitoring of patients receiving modafinil. However, a variety of drug-drug interactions are possible. Modafinil is a substrate of hepatic CYP3A4, a moderate inducer of CYP3A4, and a weak inhibitor of CYP2C19.\n[18]\n\nModafinil may decrease serum concentrations of other drugs to a clinically significant extent, including the following:\n\nAntihepaciviral combination products\nAntiretroviral combination products\nClarithromycin\nClozapine\nCyclosporine\nEstrogen Derivatives: In patients using combined oral contraceptive pills (OCP), the manufacturer recommends that patients use an alternative method of contraception, instead of or in addition to OCP, during and until one month after completing modafinil therapy.\nGuanfacine\nLurasidone\nNimodipine\nOpioid medications (eg, codeine, fentanyl, hydrocodone)\nRanolazine\nZolpidem\n\nSerum concentrations of modafinil may be decreased to a clinically significant extent in the presence of drugs that induce CYP3A4. These include rifampin, phenytoin, St John Wort, and efavirenz. Conversely, serum concentrations of modafinil may be increased to a clinically significant extent in the presence of drugs that inhibit CYP3A4. These include azole antifungals (ketoconazole, itraconazole), ritonavir, and clarithromycin.",
    "toxicity": "Case reports of modafinil overdose/toxicity are rare. Clinical manifestations of modafinil overdose are relatively mild but may include hypertension, tachycardia, agitation, and/or psychosis.\n[22]\nThe most frequently reported clinical effects were tachycardia, insomnia, agitation, dizziness, and anxiety. About 20% of overdose cases require medical treatment. Symptoms typically respond to supportive therapy, although augmentation with benzodiazepines is occasionally required. Other treatments include diphenhydramine, beta-blockers, haloperidol, IV fluid hydration, nitroglycerin, epinephrine, benztropine, and promethazine based on precipitating symptoms.\n[23]"
