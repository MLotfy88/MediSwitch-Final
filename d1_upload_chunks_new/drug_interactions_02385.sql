Patients should be closely monitored for symptoms of the serotonin syndrome during treatment.  Particular caution is advised when increasing the dosages of these agents.  The potential risk for serotonin syndrome should be considered even when administering serotonergic agents sequentially, as some agents may demonstrate a prolonged elimination half-life.  For example, some experts suggest a 5-week washout period following use of fluoxetine and 3 weeks following the use of vortioxetine before administering another serotonergic agent.  Individual product labeling for washout periods should be consulted for current recommendations.  If serotonin syndrome develops or is suspected during the course of therapy, all serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately and supportive care rendered as necessary.
