    "indications": "Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) has a 5-year cure rate of 99%, 94.4%, 92% to 99%, and 90% for primary basal cell carcinoma (BCC), recurrent BCC, primary squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and recurrent SCC, respectively.\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\nThe utility of MMS extends beyond nonmelanoma skin cancer, including treating rare tumors.\n[4]\nThe high cure rate consistently reported in MMS relies on the integrity and reproducibility of the prepared histology slides to be accurately interpreted by the Mohs surgeon. Aspects of MMS slide preparation depend on the surgeon and histology technicians. Regardless of practice preferences, the entire care team needs to recognize the technical problems that may impact slide quality. In addition to being competent in obtaining, processing, and staining tissue, clinicians should be aware of common pitfalls encountered at each step and the strategies that should be implemented to reduce potential errors."
