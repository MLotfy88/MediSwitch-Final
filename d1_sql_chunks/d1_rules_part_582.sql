In general, the risk of an individual agent or a combination of agents causing ventricular arrhythmia in association with QT prolongation is largely unpredictable but may be increased by certain underlying risk factors such as congenital long QT syndrome, cardiac disease, and electrolyte disturbances (e.g., hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia). The extent of drug-induced QT prolongation is dependent on the particular drugs involved and dosages of the drugs.', NULL, 'Due to increased risk of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes arrhythmia, concomitant use of valbenazine with quinidine should generally be avoided.', NULL, 'Due to increased risk of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes arrhythmia, concomitant use of valbenazine with quinidine should generally be avoided. Valbenazine is also not recommended for use in patients with congenital long QT syndrome or with arrhythmias associated with a prolonged QT interval. If coadministration is required, assessment of baseline QT interval and periodic monitoring during therapy may be considered. The manufacturer recommends a dosage reduction for valbenazine during concomitant administration with strong CYP450 2D6 inhibitors or in patients who are poor metabolizers of CYP450 2D6. Patients and their caregivers should be advised to seek prompt medical attention if they experience symptoms that could indicate the occurrence of torsade de pointes such as dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, palpitation, irregular heart rhythm, shortness of breath, or syncope.
