      "management_text": "Concomitant use of statins with lipid-modifying dosages of niacin (1 g/day or more) should be approached cautiously and only if the benefit of further alterations in lipid levels is anticipated to outweigh the potential risks. Addition of niacin to statin therapy typically provides little additional reduction in LDL cholesterol, but further reductions of triglycerides and increases in HDL cholesterol may be attained. If the combination is prescribed, lower dosages of the statin should be considered. Coadministration of simvastatin with high doses of niacin (1 g/day or more) is not recommended in Chinese patients due to an increased risk of myopathy. Lovastatin labeling recommends that the dosage not exceed 20 mg daily when prescribed with lipid-modifying dosages of niacin. All patients should be advised to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by fever, malaise and/or dark colored urine. Therapy should be discontinued if creatine kinase is markedly elevated in the absence of strenuous exercise or if myopathy is otherwise suspected or diagnosed.",
