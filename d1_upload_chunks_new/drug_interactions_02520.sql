Grazoprevir is reported to be a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP450 3A4 in vivo, and both elbasvir and grazoprevir are inhibitors of BCRP at the intestinal level in humans.', 'DDInter', 'Caution is advised when statins such as atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin are prescribed with elbasvir-grazoprevir.  Atorvastatin dosage should not exceed 20 mg/day and rosuvastatin dosage should not exceed 10 mg/day according to the product labeling for elbasvir-grazoprevir.  The lowest effective dose of fluvastatin, lovastatin, or simvastatin should be used; some authorities recommend a maximum daily dose of 20 mg of these statins.  In contrast, pitavastatin and pravastatin do not have clinically relevant interactions with elbasvir-grazoprevir, and no dosage adjustments are necessary.  All patients receiving statin therapy should be advised to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by fever, malaise and/or dark colored urine.  Therapy should be discontinued if creatine kinase is markedly elevated in the absence of strenuous exercise or if myopathy is otherwise suspected or diagnosed.', 'Metabolism', 'Caution is advised when statins such as atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin are prescribed with elbasvir-grazoprevir.', 'Major', 'pharmacodynamic', NULL, 'https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/299051/', '', 'Fenofibric acid, Mipomersen, Pitavastatin, Evinacumab, Evolocumab, Dextrothyroxine, Probucol, Cholestyramine, Ezetimibe, Clofibrate, Colestipol, More', 'Lamivudine, Paritaprevir, Tenofovir alafenamide, Maraviroc, Amprenavir, Simeprevir, Zanamivir, Cabotegravir, Telaprevir, Velpatasvir, Rilpivirine, More', 1767369485);
