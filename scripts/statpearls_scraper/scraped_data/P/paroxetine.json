    "indications": "There are only a few absolute contraindications for the use of paroxetine. Absolute contraindications include concurrent use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), thioridazine, and pimozide. Concomitant use of MAOIs and paroxetine can precipitate serotonin syndrome. Concurrent use of thioridazine and paroxetine can induce cardiac arrhythmias; similar effects can occur with pimozide and paroxetine.\n[6]\n\nPrecautions that should be acknowledged when prescribing paroxetine include concurrent tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) use, concomitant tamoxifen use, and drugs affecting hepatic metabolism. Paroxetine inhibits TCA metabolism, leading to possible TCA toxicity. Tamoxifen is active once metabolized by CYP4502D6; thus, paroxetine essentially inactivates tamoxifen.\n\nParoxetine is not recommended for use during pregnancy or if breastfeeding. Based on epidemiological studies, infants exposed to paroxetine during the first trimester had an increased risk for cardiovascular malformations.\n[6]",
    "mechanism": "As an SSRI class drug, paroxetine's signature mechanism of action is to block the serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) and thus increase the concentration of synaptic serotonin. Current theory suggests that the diminished serotonin concentration in the depressed brain induces the upregulation of serotonergic receptors. By increasing the synaptic serotonin concentration, paroxetine thus induces the downregulation of the previously upregulated serotonin receptors, thus normalizing the receptor concentration.\n[2]\nFurthermore, in a radioligand study, paroxetine showed some affinity for muscarinic, adrenergic (alpha and beta), dopaminergic (D2), serotonergic (5-HT2), and histaminergic (H1) receptors.\n[3]\nThese receptors have also appeared to contribute to its antidepressant effects and its side effect profile.",
    "administration": "Paroxetine is administered orally. The medication should be titrated based on the patient's symptoms and tolerance to dosage. The drug can be taken with or without food. In addition to regular tablets, it is available in a controlled-release tablet and liquid form. Paroxetine may be administered at any time of the day, depending on toleration.\n\nMetabolism\n\nThe steady-state mean value of T1/2 is 21 hours. Paroxetine undergoes metabolism via hepatic CYPP450 2D6. The urine excretes 2%, 62% metabolized over a 10-day post-dosing period, 36% excreted in the feces. Paroxetine inhibits CYP2D6 and, thus, its own metabolism; plasma concentrations can potentially double following dosage increases of 50%.\n[4]\n\nFor Major Depression\n[1]\n\nImmediate-release formulas\n\nAdults: start with 20 mg by mouth daily and increase by 10 mg weekly with a max of 50 mg per day.\nGeriatric adults: start with 10 mg by mouth daily and then increase by 10 mg weekly with a max dose of 40 mg per day orally.\n\nControlled-release formulas:\n\nAdults: Start with 25 mg by mouth daily, then increase by 12.5 mg weekly with a max of 62.5 mg.\nGeriatrics: Start with 12.5 mg by mouth once daily, then increase to 12.5 if needed weekly.\n\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder\n[1]\n\nImmediate release formulas\n\nAdults: 20 mg by mouth once daily.

    "adverse_effects": "Many of the side effects of paroxetine are dose-dependent. The most common side effects include drowsiness, dry mouth, loss of appetite, sweating, sleep disturbance, and sexual side effects. Clinicians can address sexual side effects medications like sildenafil). Discontinuation syndrome is more common and more severe with paroxetine than with other SSRIs; this may be due in part to the fact that it inhibits its own metabolism. Withdrawal symptoms from discontinuation include dizziness, lethargy, nausea, vomiting, headache, fever, chills, vivid dreams, electric shock-like-sensation, dyskinesia, anxiety, crying, irritability, and depersonalization.\n[5]\n\nOther Adverse Effects\n\nPsychiatric: Apathy and emotional flattening (indirect decrease of dopamine), hypomania, or mania (1%). In children and adolescents, and young adults (18 to 24 years of age), paroxetine can increase the risk of suicide.\nInduction of agitation or manic state may represent an underlying bipolar condition that requires the addition of a mood stabilizer, lithium, an atypical antipsychotic, and/or the discontinuation of paroxetine.\nNervous system: Extrapyramidal symptoms, dizziness, headache, tremor\nMetabolic: hyponatremia (SIADH), weight gain\nCardiovascular: Edema, chest pain, palpitations, tachycardia, vasodilation\nDermatologic: Alopecia, eczema, photosensitivity, purities\nGastrointestinal: Constipation, diarrhea, nausea",
    "monitoring": "Patients initiated on paroxetine should initially receive close observation and be monitored for worsening clinical symptoms, behavior changes (mania, social function, anxiety), or suicidal ideations. Labs should include serum sodium concentration to rule out SIADH.\n[7]\nVital signs should be monitored for signs of serotonergic hyperactivity. Serotonin syndrome precipitates via the manifestation of changes in mental status, autonomic instability, gastrointestinal symptoms, hyperreflexia, and myoclonus. Serotonin syndrome is treated by discontinuing any of the offending agents. If symptoms continue to escalate, the clinician can administer cyproheptadine.\n[8]",
    "toxicity": "Though it is rarely lethal in overdose by itself, patients can develop somnolence, nausea, tremor, heart rhythm disturbances, confusion, vomiting, dizziness, and mydriasis. During toxicity, a patient’s airway, oxygenation, and ventilation require evaluation first. The treatment for overdose includes symptomatic supportive treatment. There is no specific treatment for paroxetine toxicity.\n[9]"
