    "clinical_significance": "IgM is the initial antibody the adaptive immune system produces in response to a foreign pathogen. IgM is also the primary constituent of natural antibodies, representing a branch of the innate immune system.  There are many disorders associated with IgM; a description of some of the most pertinent disorders appears below:\n\nX-linked Hyper-IgM Syndrome\n\nHyper-IgM syndrome is predominantly a rare X-linked inherited disease that occurs in approximately 2 out of 1,000,000 million males.\n[9]\nThe disease characteristically demonstrates elevated IgM levels, deficient levels of other immunoglobulins, and defects in cellular immunity. Isotype switching is a feature of secondary responses to a pathogen by the humoral immune system, producing IgG, IgA, or IgE antibodies directed against the pathogen. The isotype class chosen upon subsequent antigen exposure is largely a function of the cytokines secreted by T helper cells. Most isotype-switching events require CD40 ligand (CD40L) interaction on activated T cells and CD40 on B cells. Defective interactions between CD40L and CD40 result in defects in B cells' isotype switching, affinity maturation, and memory lymphocyte formation. T-cell activation of macrophages and dendritic cells also requires CD40L-CD40 interactions; therefore, these cell types are also adversely affected. Patients with hyper-IgM syndrome exhibit elevated levels of IgM; the normal IgM in the serum of adults is between 37-286 mg/dl, while IgA, IgG, or IgE levels may be lower than normal or undetectable.\n[10]\n\nAlthough IgM levels are typically elevated, IgM directed against peptide antigens is often compromised, as CD40L-CD40 productive interactions are necessary to activate most B-2 follicular B cells. Therefore, one would expect the levels of anti-A and anti-B IgM antibodies in a type O patient with hyper-IgM syndrome to be elevated. However, the patient would be expected to have an inadequate immune response against peptide antigens such as the tetanus toxoid vaccine. Additionally, germinal centers are not observed in the lymph nodes of individuals with X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome, as creating germinal centers also requires specific interactions between B cells and T-helper cells. Since the gene for CD40L is on the X-chromosome, it is the most common genetic defect affecting isotype switching. However, autosomal recessive defects in other genes such as CD40, NEMO, AID, or UNG can also result in hyper-IgM syndrome, albeit much more rarely.\n[11]\nBecause CD40L-CD40 interactions are also necessary for productive interactions between activated T cells and macrophages, cellular immunity is also adversely affected, and cytokines secreted by macrophages to stimulate neutrophil production are often present at insufficient levels.\n\nIndividuals with X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome are susceptible to recurrent sinopulmonary and pyogenic infections (eg,\nH. influenzae, S. pyogenes\n) due to their inability to form IgG that can enter tissues from the blood to fight extracellular bacteria. Since cellular immunity is also compromised, defects in CD40L-CD40 signaling result in combined immunodeficiency. The inability to activate macrophages results in a significantly increased susceptibility to the opportunistic fungal pathogen\nPneumocystis jirovecii,\nand pneumonia caused by\nP. jirovecii\nin a child is often the disease's symptom. Diarrhea occurs in approximately one-third of patients due to infections by parasites such as\nCryptosporidium parvum\n. Uncontrolled cytomegalovirus infection may lead to liver disease, and individuals with CD40L deficiencies are also at a greater risk for developing malignancies, presumably due to defective cellular immunity. Individuals with hyper-IgM syndrome caused by mutations in loci other than CD40L or CD40 only experience humoral defects and do not experience compromised cellular immunity.\n\nThe initial diagnosis of X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome is made predominantly on the clinical symptoms of a patient with an uncontrolled infection that exhibits normal or elevated IgM levels, with very low or undetectable IgG and IgA levels. Flow cytometry can be conducted for the presence of CD40L on T-cells activated in vitro. However, identification of the relevant mutation (eg, CD40L in a male patient) by genetic testing is useful for definitive analysis. Patients with hyper-IgM syndromes r administered intravenous gammaglobulin (IVIG) regardless of the genetic cause of the disease. X-linked hyper-IgM patients also receive trimethoprim-cotrimoxazole as a prophylactic treatment against\nP. jirovecii\ninfection. Protective measures against exposure to\nCryptosporidium sp.\nare also advised, for example, by avoiding swimming in lakes to avoid exposure to\nC. parvum\ncysts, as an active\nC. parvum\ninfection is challenging to treat. GM-CSF can be administered to patients to treat sores and blisters that result from neutropenia caused by defective macrophage activation.\n\nSelective IgM Deficiency\n\nSelective IgM deficiency (SIGMD) is a rare disorder with fewer than 300 cases reported. SIGMD is associated with an isolated deficiency in IgM in the presence of normal levels of other immunoglobulins such as IgG and IgA and normal levels of T cells and other leukocytes.\n[12]\nIndividuals with SIGMD may be asymptomatic, or they may suffer from recurring infections from encapsulated bacteria (eg,\nS. pneumoniae\nand\nH. influenzae\n) in addition to viral infections. Additionally, SIGMD can be associated with malignancy, autoimmunity, or allergy. SIGMD may be a secondary effect of another disease, such as malignancy or bacteremia. Yet, primary causes of SIGMD have also been described, as some are associated with deletions on chromosome 22, for example.\n[12]\nThe diagnosis of SIGMD is one of exclusion. Other diseases that result in low levels of multiple isotypes must be excluded, such as common variable immunodeficiency or X-linked agammaglobulinemia, which likely result in reduced levels of several antibody isotypes. Conversely, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is often associated with low IgM yet elevated levels of IgG and IgA.\nCold Agglutinin Disease\n\nCold agglutinin disease (CAD) is a form of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AHA) mediated predominantly by IgM antibodies. As the name of the disease implies, IgM recognizing these erythrocyte antigens can agglutinate erythrocytes at colder temperatures. IgG or IgM antibodies that bind to erythrocytes can lead to red blood cell destruction by either promoting opsonization and clearance of erythrocytes by phagocytes in the spleen or liver or by activating complement leading to erythrocyte lysis as a result of MAC formation. Autoantibodies can cause AHA, can be induced by an infection, or can be drug-induced, in which case antibodies recognize complexes of drugs bound to erythrocytes. CAD is a rare disease affecting approximately 16 per million and is predominantly associated with IgM autoantibodies directed against the blood group antigens large I and small i.\n[13]\n[14]\nThese ubiquitously expressed antigens are polysaccharides, and due to their relatively weak non-covalent interactions with IgM, IgM binding to the antigens is significantly strengthed at lower temperatures when erythrocytes circulate in the periphery.\n\nThe binding of IgM to erythrocytes activates the classical complement pathway, resulting in the attachment of the opsonin C3b to the erythrocyte. This IgM-mediated C3b binding to the erythrocyte is stable even when the erythrocyte returns closer to core body temperatures, resulting in dissociation of IgM. Therefore, CAD can promote hemolytic destruction of erythrocytes through opsonization by macrophages in the spleen or liver. In contrast, autoantibodies that bind to erythrocytes at warmer temperatures are typically IgG. These temperature-dependent differences in antibody binding between IgM and IgG appear to reflect the thermodynamic differences between polysaccharide and peptide binding, respectively, as recognition of peptide antigens can involve hydrophobic interactions, which are relatively strong non-covalent forces not found in interactions between polysaccharides. CAD is a relapsing disease in which the severity of the disease fluctuates depending on the concentration of antibodies and how well they can activate complement. CAD may occur as a result of an underlying condition, such as a result of an infection or undiagnosed lymphoproliferative disorder. CAD is often associated with infections by either the Epstein-Barr virus, the cause of infectious mononucleosis, or\nM. pneumoniae,\nthe primary cause of atypical pneumonia.  For patients who suffer debilitating symptoms due to CAD, avoidance of cold temperatures is paramount, including drinking cold liquids or being in cold rooms. Severe anemia can be treated with transfusions and plasmapheresis to remove the IgM molecules serving as cold agglutinins. It bears mentioning that all intravenous solutions should be warmed to body temperature yet must not exceed 40 degrees centigrade before infusion. Patients with CAD should undergo evaluation for an underlying disorder; antimicrobial therapy, for example, is warranted if an infection is associated with the condition. CAD may also occur from other primary causes, such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and therefore, flow cytometry of leukocytes biopsied from the bone marrow is useful in this regard. Rituximab is very useful for the treatment of debilitating CAD that is not associated with a malignancy, and the ability to treat CAD with inhibitors of complement is an area of active investigation.\nMonoclonal Gammopathies\n\nThe proliferation of single clones of plasma cells characterizes monoclonal gammopathies. Several monoclonal gammopathies are associated with the overproduction of IgM. This condition can be referred to as macroglobulinemia, as the letter designation of IgM derived from its original description as macroglobulin, due to its much larger size than IgG. Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) is a rare example of such a disorder that most commonly presents in the seventh decade of life. In addition to elevated serum IgM, WM results in the infiltration of the bone marrow by lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, a low-grade and slow-growing form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Patients with WM are most commonly present with a pale appearance, oronasal bleeding, organomegaly, and other systemic complaints such as weakness and fatigue.\n\nThe absence of involvement of the bone or kidneys is useful in distinguishing WM from multiple myeloma. An increased hyperviscosity of the blood due to increased IgM secretion can lead to CNS effects, such as headache, loss of vision, ataxia, weakness, deafness, and dilated retinal veins. Such symptoms associated with WM hyperviscosity are a potential medical emergency and should be treated with plasmapheresis. The criteria for diagnosing a patient with WM require a demonstration of monoclonal IgM in the blood and at least 10 percent of the bone marrow biopsy demonstrating infiltration of small lymphoplasmacytic cells. Many patients are asymptomatic and receive a diagnosis of WM after receiving lab tests for another reason. Asymptomatic patients can be monitored with regular office visits to assess complete blood counts and monoclonal IgM levels. Symptomatic WM treatment is with a regimen that includes rituximab. As noted, plasmapheresis is necessary if symptoms of hyperviscosity are present, followed by chemotherapy to slow the growth of the malignant clone. A mutation in the gene encoding for MYD88 (MYD88 L265P) is present in over 90% of patients diagnosed with WM, and identifying this mutation can help distinguish WM from other disorders.\n[15]\nMonoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is an additional type of monoclonal gammopathy that can result in the overproduction of antibodies, including IgM. MGUS occurs in approximately 1 to 2% of adults, with a higher proportion of cases in men, and the incidence gradually increases with age.\n[16]\nMGUS is a clinically asymptomatic premalignant clonal plasma cell that is diagnosable by demonstrating a concentration of monoclonal immunological protein (M protein) of less than 3 grams/dL and fewer than 10 percent of biopsied bone marrow containing infiltrating monoclonal plasma cells. Higher values of M protein or bone marrow infiltration indicate multiple myeloma. Additionally, the absence of organ damage caused by the proliferating plasma cells helps further distinguish MGUS from multiple myeloma.\n\nNon-IgM MGUS is the most common type of MGUS and is associated with elevated levels of monoclonal IgG, IgA, or IgD. Non-IgM MGUS requires monitoring as the disease has the capability of progressing to multiple myeloma. IgM MGUS accounts for approximately 15% of MGUS cases and is more likely to progress to WM than multiple myeloma. Finally, light chain MGUS represents an additional class of MGUS associated with elevated serum M protein that lacks the heavy chain and, therefore, is only composed of light chains of an immunoglobulin. Deporting excess monoclonal light chains throughout the body can result in light-chain amyloidosis. Although asymptomatic, all types of MGUS require close monitoring as they each possess a risk for developing into a more advanced lymphoproliferative disorder or malignancy."
