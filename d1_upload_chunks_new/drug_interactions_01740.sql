Clinically significant mental status changes associated with anticholinergic agents can range from mild cognitive impairment to delirium, and patients with Alzheimer''s disease and other dementia are especially sensitive.', 'DDInter', 'Drugs that possess anticholinergic activity should generally be avoided in patients with Alzheimer''s disease or other cognitive impairment, regardless of whether they are receiving an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. For patients requiring treatment to counteract adverse effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor therapy (e.g., gastrointestinal intolerance, urinary problems), an agent without anticholinergic properties should be used whenever possible. Otherwise, a dosage reduction, slower titration, or even discontinuation of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor should be considered. For patients who are already receiving an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor with anticholinergic agents, every attempt should be made to discontinue the latter or substitute them with less anticholinergic alternatives.', 'Antagonism', 'Drugs that possess anticholinergic activity should generally be avoided in patients with Alzheimer''s disease or other cognitive impairment, regardless of whether they are receiving an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.', 'Moderate', 'pharmacodynamic', NULL, 'https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/174288/', '', 'Citalopram, Sertraline, Fluoxetine, St. John''s Wort, Milnacipran, Vortioxetine, Levomilnacipran, Duloxetine, Isocarboxazid, Viloxazine, Esketamine, More', 'Latanoprost, Methazolamide, Neostigmine, Pilocarpine, Diclofenamide, Bimatoprost, Travoprost, Brinzolamide, Brimonidine, Levobunolol, Hydroxocobalamin, More', 1767369485);
