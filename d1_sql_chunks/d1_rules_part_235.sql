Serotonin syndrome is a rare but serious and potentially fatal condition thought to result from hyperstimulation of brainstem 5-HT1A and 2A receptors. Symptoms of the serotonin syndrome may include mental status changes such as irritability, altered consciousness, confusion, hallucinations, and coma; autonomic dysfunction such as tachycardia, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, shivering, blood pressure lability, and mydriasis; neuromuscular abnormalities such as hyperreflexia, myoclonus, tremor, rigidity, and ataxia; and gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Since many serotonergic agents can also cause central nervous system depression, concomitant use with opioids may result in increased sedation and impairment of judgment, thinking, and psychomotor skills.', 'DDInter', 1767317475, 'Caution is advised when opioids are used concomitantly with serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), other antidepressants/psychotropic agents (e.g., amoxapine, buspirone, lithium, maprotiline, mirtazepine, nefazodone, trazodone, vilazodone), 5-HT1 receptor agonists (triptans), 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, cyclobenzaprine, dextromethorphan, 5-hydroxytryptophan, and St. John''s wort.
