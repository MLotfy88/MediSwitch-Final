The retention of phosphate plays a pivotal role in causing secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with osteodystrophy, and soft-tissue calcification. The mechanism by which phosphate retention leads to hyperparathyroidism is not clearly delineated. Therapeutic efforts directed toward the control of hyperphosphatemia include reduction in the dietary intake of phosphate, inhibition of absorption of phosphate in the intestine with phosphate binders, and removal of phosphate from the body by more efficient methods of dialysis. The rate of removal of phosphate by dietary manipulation or by dialysis is insufficient. Dialysis patients absorb 40% to 80% of dietary phosphorus. Therefore, the fraction of dietary phosphate absorbed from the diet needs to be reduced by using phosphate binders in most renal failure patients on maintenance dialysis. Calcium acetate when taken with meals combines with dietary phosphate to form insoluble calcium phosphate which is excreted in the feces. Maintenance of serum phosphorus below 6.0 mg/dl is generally considered as a clinically acceptable outcome of treatment with phosphate binders.

Acne is a multifactorial condition, and evidence exists to support multiple mechanisms of action for adapalene. Adapalene binds to retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-beta and RAR-gamma; this complex subsequently binds to one of three retinoid X receptors (RXRs), which as a complex is capable of binding DNA to modulate transcriptional activity.[A193509] Although the full extent of transcriptional modulation is not described, retinoid activation is generally known to affect cellular proliferation and differentiation[A193527], and adapalene has been shown to inhibit HeLa cell proliferation and human keratinocyte differentiation.[A193515] These effects primarily account for adapalene''s comedolytic and anticomedogenic properties.



In addition, adapalene modulates the immune response by down-regulating toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2) expression and inhibiting the transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP-1). TLR-2 recognizes _Cutibacterium acnes_ (formerly _Propionibacterium acnes_), the bacterium primarily associated with acne. TLR-2 activation causes nuclear translocation of AP-1 and downstream pro-inflammatory gene regulation. Therefore, adapalene has a general anti-inflammatory effect, which reduces inflammation-mediated acne symptoms.[A193512]

Acne is a multifactorial condition, and evidence exists to support multiple mechanisms of action for adapalene. Adapalene binds to retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-beta and RAR-gamma; this complex subsequently binds to one of three retinoid X receptors (RXRs), which as a complex is capable of binding DNA to modulate transcriptional activity.[A193509] Although the full extent of transcriptional modulation is not described, retinoid activation is generally known to affect cellular proliferation and differentiation[A193527], and adapalene has been shown to inhibit HeLa cell proliferation and human keratinocyte differentiation.[A193515] These effects primarily account for adapalene''s comedolytic and anticomedogenic properties.



In addition, adapalene modulates the immune response by down-regulating toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2) expression and inhibiting the transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP-1). TLR-2 recognizes _Cutibacterium acnes_ (formerly _Propionibacterium acnes_), the bacterium primarily associated with acne. TLR-2 activation causes nuclear translocation of AP-1 and downstream pro-inflammatory gene regulation. Therefore, adapalene has a general anti-inflammatory effect, which reduces inflammation-mediated acne symptoms.[A193512]

Bortezomib is a reversible inhibitor of the 26S proteasome, which is made up of a 20S core complexed with a 19S regulatory complex. Individual β-subunits allow specific catalytic action of the 20S core.[A18509, A204083] In mammalian cells, bortezomib is a potent inhibitor of the proteasome’s chymotryptic-like activity, which is attributed to the β5-subunit of the 20S core particle.[A18509] Bortezomib binds to the active site of the threonine hydroxyl group in the β5-subunit.[A204083] A probing study showed bortezomib also binding to and inhibiting the β1-subunit, which mediates the caspase-like activity of the proteasome, and β1i-subunit, which is an altered subunit that is expressed to form immunoproteasomes in response to cell stress or inflammation.[A18509] By inhibiting the proteasome-mediated degradation of key proteins that promote cell apoptosis,[A18508] bortezomib induces a cell cycle arrest during the G2-M phase.[L14180] It is believed that multiple mechanisms, other than proteasome inhibition, may be involved in the anticancer activity of bortezomib.[A204083] The anticancer activity of bortezomib was largely associated with suppression of the NF-κB signalling pathway, resulting in the downregulation of anti-apoptotic target genes and expression of anti-apoptic proteins. This may be explained by bortezomib preventing uncontrolled degradation of IκB, which is an inhibitory protein of NF-κB. NOXA, which is a pro-apoptotic factor, induced by bortezomib selectively in cancer cells; thus, it is suggested to be another key mechanism of bortezomib.[A204083]', 'Bortezomib works to target the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, an essential molecular pathway that regulates intracellular concentrations of proteins and promotes protein degradation.[A272] The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is often dysregulated in pathological conditions, leading to aberrant pathway signalling and the formation of malignant cells. In one study, patient-derived chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells contained 3-fold higher levels of chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity than normal lymphocytes.[A272] By reversibly inhibiting proteasome, bortezomib prevents proteasome-mediated proteolysis. Bortezomib exerts a cytotoxic effect on various cancer cell types _in vitro_ and delays tumour growth _in vivo_ in nonclinical tumour models.[L14177] Bortezomib inhibits the proteasome activity in a dose-dependent manner.

Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), in the regular tablet form (immediate-release), is indicated to relieve pain, fever, and inflammation associated with many conditions, including the flu, the common cold, neck and back pain, dysmenorrhea, headache, tooth pain, sprains, fractures, myositis, neuralgia, synovitis, arthritis, bursitis, burns, and various injuries. It is also used for symptomatic pain relief after surgical and dental procedures [FDA label]. 



The _extra strength_ formulation of acetylsalicylic acid is also indicated for the management migraine pain with photophobia (sensitivity to light) and phonophobia (sensitivity to sound)[FDA label].



**Other indications**



ASA is also indicated for various other purposes, due to its ability to inhibit platelet aggregation. These include: 



Reducing the risk of cardiovascular death in suspected cases of myocardial infarction (MI) [FDA label]. 



Reducing the risk of a first non-fatal myocardial infarction in patients, and for reducing the risk of morbidity and mortality in cases of unstable angina and in those who have had a prior myocardial infarction [FDA label].



For reducing the risk of transient ischemic attacks (TIA) and to prevent atherothrombotic cerebral infarction (in conjunction with other treatments) [FDA label].



For the prevention of thromboembolism after hip replacement surgery [FDA label]. 



For decreasing platelet to platelet adhesion following carotid endarterectomy, aiding in the prevention of transient ischemic attacks (TIA) [FDA label].



Used for patients undergoing hemodialysis with a silicone rubber arteriovenous cannula inserted to prevent thrombosis at the insertion site [FDA Label]. 



**Important note regarding use of the extended-release formulation [F4405]**



In the setting of acute myocardial infarction, or before percutaneous interventions, the extended-release form of acetylsalicylic acid should not be used. Use immediate-release formulations in scenarios requiring rapid onset of action [Label, F4405]. The extended-release form is taken to decrease the incidence of mortality and myocardial infarction (MI) for individuals diagnosed with chronic coronary artery disease (CAD), including patients with previous myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina or with chronic stable angina. Additionally, the extended-release form is used to decrease the risk of death and recurrent episodes of stroke in patients with a history of stroke or TIA [F4405].





 ', 'Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) blocks prostaglandin synthesis. It is non-selective for COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes [A177241, A10989, A32682]. Inhibition of COX-1 results in the inhibition of platelet aggregation for about 7-10 days (average platelet lifespan). The acetyl group of acetylsalicylic acid binds with a serine residue of the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) enzyme, leading to irreversible inhibition. This prevents the production of pain-causing prostaglandins. This process also stops the conversion of arachidonic acid to thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which is a potent inducer of platelet aggregation [FDA label].  Platelet aggregation can result in clots and harmful venous and arterial thromboembolism, leading to conditions such as pulmonary embolism and stroke. 



It is important to note that there is 60% homology between the protein structures of COX-1 and COX-2. ASA binds to serine 516 residue on the active site of COX-2 in the same fashion as its binding to the serine 530 residue located on the active site of COX-1. The active site of COX-2 is, however, slightly larger than the active site of COX-1, so that arachidonic acid (which later becomes prostaglandins) manages to bypass the aspirin molecule inactivating COX-2 [A32682, A177256].  ASA, therefore, exerts more action on the COX-1 receptor rather than on the COX-2 receptor [A177268]. A higher dose of acetylsalicylic acid is required for COX-2 inhibition [A177325]. ', '**Effects on pain and fever**



Acetylsalicylic acid disrupts the production of prostaglandins throughout the body by targeting cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) [A177241, A10989, A32682]. Prostaglandins are potent, irritating substances that have been shown to cause headaches and pain upon injection into humans.  Prostaglandins increase the sensitivity of pain receptors and substances such as histamine and bradykinin. Through the disruption of the production and prevention of release of prostaglandins in inflammation, this drug may stop their action at pain receptors, preventing symptoms of pain. Acetylsalicylic acid is considered an antipyretic agent because of its ability to interfere with the production of brain prostaglandin E1. Prostaglandin E1 is known to be an extremely powerful fever-inducing agent [FDA label]. 



**Effects on platelet aggregation**



The inhibition of platelet aggregation by ASA occurs because of its interference with thromboxane A2 in platelets, caused by COX-1 inhibition. Thromboxane A2 is an important lipid responsible for platelet aggregation, which can lead to clot formation and future risk of heart attack or stroke  [FDA label]. 



**A note on cancer prevention**



ASA has been studied in recent years to determine its effect on the prevention of various malignancies [A177325]. In general, acetylsalicylic acid is involved in the interference of various cancer signaling pathways, sometimes inducing or upregulating tumor suppressor genes [A177325, A177403]. Results of various studies suggest that there are beneficial effects of long-term ASA use in the prevention of several types of cancer, including stomach, colorectal, pancreatic, and liver cancers [A177400].

**Pantoprazole Injection**:



**Treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease associated with a history of erosive esophagitis**

**Pathological Hypersecretion Associated with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome**



Pantoprazole for injection is indicated for the treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions associated with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome or other neoplastic conditions.[FDA label]



**Pantoprazole delayed-release oral suspension**:



**Short-Term Treatment of erosive esophagitis associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**



Indicated in adults and pediatric patients five years of age and above for the short-term treatment (up to 8 weeks) in the healing and symptomatic relief of erosive esophagitis. For adult patients who have not healed after 8 weeks of treatment, an additional 8-week course of pantoprazole may be considered. Safety of treatment beyond 8 weeks in pediatric patients has not been determined.[F3202]



**Maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis**



Indicated for maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis and reduction in relapse rates of daytime and nighttime heartburn symptoms in adult patients with GERD.[F3202]



**Pathological hypersecretory conditions including Zollinger-Ellison syndrome**



Indicated for the long-term treatment of the above conditions.[F3202]', 'Hydrochloric acid (HCl) secretion into the gastric lumen is a process regulated mainly by the H(+)/K(+)-ATPase of the proton pump, expressed in high quantities by the parietal cells of the stomach.[A174295] ATPase is an enzyme on the parietal cell membrane that facilitates hydrogen and potassium exchange through the cell, which normally results in the extrusion of potassium and formation of HCl (gastric acid). 



Proton pump inhibitors such as pantoprazole are substituted _benzimidazole_ derivatives, weak bases, which accumulate in the acidic space of the parietal cell before being converted in the _canaliculi_  (small canal) of the gastric parietal cell, an acidic environment, to active _sulfenamide_ derivatives. This active form then makes disulfide bonds with important cysteines on the gastric acid pump, inhibiting its function.[A174247] Specifically, pantoprazole binds to the _sulfhydryl group_ of H+, K+-ATPase, which is an enzyme implicated in accelerating the final step in the acid secretion pathway. The enzyme is inactivated, inhibiting gastric acid secretion.[A174253] The inhibition of gastric acid secretion is stronger with proton pump inhibitors such as pantoprazole and lasts longer than with the H(2) antagonists.[A174295] ', 'This drug acts to decrease gastric acid secretion, which reduces stomach acidity. Pantoprazole administration leads to long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion.[F3193]



**General Effects**



Pantoprazole has been shown to reduce acid reflux-related symptoms, heal inflammation of the esophagus, and improve patient quality of life more effectively than histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2 blockers). This drug has an excellent safety profile and a low incidence of drug interactions. It can be used safely in various high-risk patient populations, including the elderly and those with renal failure or moderate hepatic dysfunction.[A174226]



Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as pantoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]



PPIs such as pantoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes [A177577, A177580]. 



**A note on laboratory testing abnormalities**



During treatment with antisecretory medicinal products such as pantoprazole, serum gastrin (a peptide hormone that stimulates secretion of gastric acid) increases in response to the decreased acid secretion caused by proton pump inhibition. The increased gastrin level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Published evidence suggests that proton pump inhibitors should be stopped 14 days before chromogranin A (CgA) measurements. This permits chromogranin A levels, that might be falsely elevated after proton pump inhibitor treatment, to return to the normal reference range.[F3217] 



Reports have been made of false-positive results in urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving the majority of proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole. A confirmatory method should be used.[F3217]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

This is the event that triggers the nerve impulse to the brain which allows for the perception of light. All-<i>trans</i>-retinal is then released from opsin and reduced to all-<i>trans</i>-retinol.

Night blindness or defective vision at low illumination results from a failure to re-synthesize 11-<i>cis</i> retinal rapidly. Epithelial differentiation: The role of Vitamin A in epithelial differentiation, as well as in other physiological processes, involves the binding of Vitamin A to two families of nuclear retinoid receptors (retinoic acid receptors, RARs; and retinoid-X receptors, RXRs).

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as pantoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]



PPIs such as pantoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes [A177577, A177580].

After activation by adenosine kinase to ribavirin mono-, di-, and triphosphate metabolites. Ribavirin triphosphate (RTP) is the predominant metabolite which directly inhibits viral mRNA polymerase by binding to the nucleotide binding site of the enzyme. This prevents the binding of the correct nucleotides, leading to a reduction in viral replication or to the production of defective virions [A19645]. RTP also demonstrates an inhibitory action on viral mRNA guanylyltransferase and mRNA 2′-O-methyltransferase of dengue virus. Inhibition of these enzymes disrupts the posttranslational capping of the 5′ end of viral mRNA through ribavirin being incorporated at the 5′ end in place of guanosine and preventing the cap methylation step. 



Inhibition of host inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and subsequent depletion of GTP pool is proposed to be another mechanism of action of ribavirin. IMPDH catalyzes the rate-limiting step where inosine 5′-monophosphate is converted to xanthine monophosphate during guanosine monophosphate (GMP) synthesis. GMP is later converted to guanosine triphoshpate (GTP). Ribavirin monophosphate mimics inosine 5′-monophosphate and acts as a competitive inhibitor of IMPDH. Inhibited de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides and decreased intracellular GTP pools leads to a decline in viral protein synthesis and limit replication of viral genomes [A19645].



Ribavirin acts as a mutagen in the target virus to cause an ''error catastrophe'' due to increased viral mutations. RTP pairs with cytidine triphosphate or uridine triphosphate with equal efficiency and to block HCV RNA elongation. It causes premature termination of nascent HCV RNA and increases mutagenesis by producing defective virions [A19645].



Ribavirin also exerts an immunomodulatory action of the host to the virus by shifting a Th2 response in favor of a Th1 phenotype. Th2 response and production of type 2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 stimulates the humoral response which enhances immunity toward the virus [A19645].

Th2 response and production of type 2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 stimulates the humoral response which enhances immunity toward the virus [A19645]. Ribavirin enhanced induction of interferon-related genes, including the interferon-α receptor, and down-regulation of genes involved in interferon inhibition, apoptosis, and hepatic stellate cell activation in vitro [A19644]. ', 'Ribavirin mediates direct antiviral activity against a number of DNA and RNA viruses by increasing the mutation frequency in the genomes of several RNA viruses. It is a member of the nucleoside antimetabolite drugs that interfere with duplication of the viral genetic material. The drug inhibits the activity of the enzyme RNA dependent RNA polymerase, due to its resemblence to building blocks of the RNA molecules. ', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Entacapone is used in the treatment of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease as an adjunct to levodopa/carbidopa therapy. Entacapone selectively and reversiblly inhibits catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). In mammals, COMT is distributed throughout various organs with the highest activities in the liver and kidney. COMT also occurs in the heart, lung, smooth and skeletal muscles, intestinal tract, reproductive organs, various glands, adipose tissue, skin, blood cells and neuronal tissues, especially in glial cells. COMT catalyzes the transfer of the methyl group of S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the phenolic group of substrates that contain a catechol structure. Physiological substrates of COMT include dopa, catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine) and their hydroxylated metabolites. The function of COMT is the elimination of biologically active catechols and some other hydroxylated metabolites. COMT is responsible for the elimination of biologically active catechols and some other hydroxylated metabolites.

', '**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].



Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].



In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].



There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].



Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].



The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. 



In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].



In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].



The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].', 'Zinc is involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of human proteins may bind zinc, in addition to hundreds of proteins that transport and traffic zinc. It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is an essential element for a proper sense of taste and smell and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations [L2211].



Studies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions [L2095]:



**Colds:** Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently [L2095].



**Wound healing:** Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements [L2095]. 



**Diahrrea**: Oral zinc supplements can reduce the symptoms of diarrhea in children with low levels of zinc, especially in cases of malnutrition [L2095].

Eicosapentaenoic acids compete with constitutive levels of arachidonic acid in cell membranes for the same desaturation enzymes and produce 3-series prostaglandins and thromboxanes, and 5-series leukotrienes which have low pro-inflammatory potential. The alteration in leukotriene biosynthesis due to higher concentration of omega-3 fatty acids compared to arachidonic acid underlies the anti-inflammatory effects. 

EPA and DHA also give rise to resolvins and related lipid signalling molecules such as protectins via cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, which have anti-inflammatory effects. They inhibit transendothelial migration of neutrophils and inhibit TNF and IL-1β production. Omega-3 fatty acids also decrease adhesion molecule expression on leukocytes and on endothelial cells and decrease intercellular adhesive interactions.

Omega-3 (or n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and their metabolites are natural ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma that regulates inflammatory gene expression and NFκB activation. PPAR alpha activation is also associated with induction of COX-2 expression. 

The role of EPA and DHA in reducing triglyceride levels include inhibition of acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase, increased mitochondrial and peroxisomal-beta-oxidation in the liver, decreased lipogenesis in the liver, and increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity. They also may reduce triglyceride synthesis because they are poor substrates for the enzymes responsible for TG synthesis, and EPA and DHA inhibit esterification of other fatty acids. ', 'Omega-3 fatty acids are triglycerides that get broken down into smaller fatty acid units. They act to reduce plasma triglyceride levels however increase the cholesterol levels and are thought to possess potent antiarrythmic effects. Polyunsaturated fatty acids including eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid mediate important cellular function such as inhibition of platelet function, prolongation of bleeding time, anti-inflammatory effects and reduction of plasma fibrinogen. Polyunsaturated fatty acids are components of the phospholipids that form the structures of the cell membranes and also serve as energy source.

Following irradiation, aloe polysaccharides block the upregulation of pro-apoptotic p53, Bax, and Bad while blocking downregulating anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 [A32473]. _In vivo_, aloe polysaccharides may act as a scavenger for oxygen free radicals including DPPH, alkyl radicals, superoxides, and singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals that may also be generated by superoxides [A32470, A32476]. Hydrogen peroxide, which is a weak initiate lipid peroxidation, may also be effectively scavenged by aloe polysaccharides [A32476]. In a Fenton reaction system, aloe polysaccharides demonstrated a concentration-dependent scavenging activity against hydroxyl radical that were generated during the reaction [A32476]. Aloe polysaccharides may also compete with oxygen to react with nitric oxide (NO), thereby inhibiting the generation of nitrite and peroxynitrite anions that act as free radicals [A32476]. 



Findings from a study investigating the effects of aloe polysaccharides on doxorubicin-induced oxidative stress suggest that aloe polysaccharides mediate potent antioxidant actions _in vivo_ [A32476]. Doxorubicin, known to generate reactive oxygen species such as superoxide and hydroxy radicals, was administered to albino rats. This led to myocardial oxidative stress and cardiac injury accompanied by leakage of LDH and CPK from cardiac myocytes and to serum due to lipid peroxidation of cardiac membranes, reduced levels of antioxidant coenzyme GSH, and increased levels of SOD from a compensatory and combative mechanism of oxidative stress [A32476]. Treatment with aloe polysaccharides resulted in a significant decrease in serum LDH and CPK levels, indicating that aloe polysaccharides are capable in stabilizing cardiac membranes from peroxidative damage. Restored levels of endogenous GSH and SOD in a dose-dependent manner were also observed with the treatment of aloe polysaccharides, suggesting that aloe polysaccharides exhibit potent antioxidant properties [A32476].



In a study of rats with open cutaneous back wounds, treatment with aloe polysaccharides decreased the levels of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) and induced tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) during the early stage of wound repair, resulting in decreased collagen breakdown and increased preservation of collagen content in the injured area [A32471].

It is believed that copper is reduced to the Cu1+ form prior to transport. Once inside the enterocyte, it is bound to copper transport protein ATOX1 which shuttles the ion to copper transporting ATPase-1 on the golgi membrane which take up copper into the golgi apparatus. Once copper has been secreted by enterocytes into the systemic circulation it remain largely bound by ceruloplasmin (65-90%), albumin (18%), and alpha 2-macroglobulin (12%). 



Copper is an essential element in the body and is incorporated into many oxidase enzymes as a cofactor [A19518]. It is also a component of zinc/copper super oxide dismutase, giving it an anti-oxidant role. Copper defiency occurs in Occipital Horn Syndrome and Menke''s disease both of which are associated with impaired development of connective tissue due to the lack of copper to act as a cofactor in protein-lysine-6-oxidase. Menke''s disease is also associated with progressive neurological impairment leading to death in infancy. The precise mechanisms of the effects of copper deficiency are vague due to the wide range of enzymes which use the ion as a cofactor.

Indicated for the treatment of persistent (non-transient) facial erythema of rosacea in adults 18 years of age or older.[L6535]', 'In the eye, alpha-1 adrenoceptors play a role in vasoconstriction, mydriasis, eyelid retraction, and elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) whereas alpha-2 adrenoceptors are responsible for IOP reduction via a complex Gi-coupled signaling cascade pathway. Activation of alpha-2 receptors leads to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and reduction of cyclic AMP levels. As a result, there is a decrease in norpinephrine (NE) release at the synaptic junction, NE-induced stimulation of beta-2 adrenoceptors, and production of aqueous humor by the ciliary epithelium.[A178969] An elevated IOP is the most significant risk factor for developing glaucomatous optic neuropathy, which is associated with progressive visual field loss and functional disability if left untreated.[A179002] Regardless of the etiology of the disease, the aim of current therapies for glaucoma is to reduce IOP, as reduction of IOP significantly reduces the risk of progression of vision loss even when IOP is already within the normal range.[A36674] When administered ophthalmically, brimonidine is rapidly absorbed into the eye, acts as an agonist at ocular alpha-2 adrenoceptors and lowers IOP via a dual mechanism of action.[A178981] It is proposed that initial dosing of the drug causes a reduction in aqueous humour production and chronic dosing leads to an increase in uveoscleral outflow.[A179002] Brimonidine does not affect episcleral venous pressure.[A178969] By reducing IOP, brimonidine aims to reduce the likelihood of glaucomatous visual field loss in ocular hypertension, and slow the progression of visual field defect in established open-angle glaucoma.[A178951] When applied topically on skin, brimonidine reduces erythema through direct vasocontriction of small arteries and veins.[A178978] As brimonidine mediates a potent peripheral vasoconstrictive activity by selectively working on the alpha-2 adrenoceptors, the use of brimonidine is thought to be efficacious for the treatment of facial erythema of rosacea, which is thought to arise from vasomotor instability and abnormal vasodilation of the superficial cutaneous vasculature of the face.[A178984]', 'Brimonidine is a highly selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist that is 1000-fold more selective for the alpha2-adrenergic receptor than the alpha1-adrenergic receptor.[L6544] This characteristic gives the drug some therapeutic advantages, since it reduces the risk of systemic side effects, such as systemic hypotension, bradycardia, and sedation. In addition, there is a reduction in the risk for developing alpha-1 mediated ocular unwanted effects, such as conjunctival blanching, mydriasis, and eyelid retraction.[A179002] However, despite high alpha-2 receptor specificity, brimonidine may still produce alpha-1 adrenoceptor-mediated ocular effects, such as conjunctival vasoconstriction.[A178969] Brimonidine has a peak ocular hypotensive effect occurring at two hours post-dosing.[label] In a randomized, double-blind clinical study, ocular administration of 0.2% brimonidine in healthy volunteers resulted in a 23% reduction of mean intraocular pressure from baseline at 3 hours following administration.[A178951] In comparative studies consisting of patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, the ocular hypotensive effect of brimonidine was maintained during treatment periods of up to 1 year.[A178945] 



Brimonidine mediates vasoconstrictive effects and it was shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory properties in _ex vivo_ human skin model and _in vivo_ inflammation models.[A179041] In a clinial trials consisting of adults with moderate to severe facial erythema of rosacea, brimonidine was shown to improve the extent of redness at 3 hours after application, compared to placebo.[L6544] It was shown to be a potent vasoconstrictor of human subcutaneous vessels with a diameter of less than 200 µm. In _in vivo_ mouse inflammation models, brimonidine displayed anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting edema.[A178978] In a randomized, double-blind study, brimonidine reduced erythema for the 12 hours of the study in a dose-dependent manner.[A178978]



When adminsitered systemically, brimonidine was shown to cause cardiovascular effects by decreasing blood pressure, decreasing heart and respiratory rate, and prolonging the PR interval in the electrocardiogram. This is due to the targeting of adrenoceptors by the drug.[A178963,A178966] Although the clinical significance has not been established, there is evidence that brimonidine exhibits neuroprotective activity in experimental models of cerebral ischemia and optic nerve injury.[A178969] _In vitro_ studies show that brimonidine mediated protective effects on neuronal cells from kainate acid insult and on cultured retinal ganglion cells from glutamate-induced cytotoxicity, which is a possible mediator of secondary neuronal degeneration in human glaucoma. Neuroprotective actions of brimonidine were also demonstrated in rat models of acute retinal ischemia and chronic IOP elevation. It has been proposed that brimonidine may exert neuroprotective effects on the retina and optic nerve by enhancing intrinsic retinal ganglion cell survival mechanisms and/or induction of neuronal survival factors, such as bFGF.[A178951] However, further investigations are needed to conclude on these possible therapeutic benefits of the drug.', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

[L39095] Patients may experience ED due to a variety of causes including psychogenic, neurogenic, vasculogenic, iatrogenic, or endocrine. [A242392] These causes result in dysfunction of penile smooth muscle relaxation through either disrupted neuronal signaling or direct influence on smooth muscle cells. During sexual arousal, non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) neurons release nitric oxide (NO). Nitric oxide stimulates guanylate cyclase which converts guanosine triphosphate to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).[A242287, A242377] cGMP activates the cGMP-dependent kinase (PKG) in a signal cascade which activates K+ channels leading to inhibition of Ca2+ channels, inhibits platelet activation, and inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation while inducing apoptosis. This signal cascade is attenuated by PDE5 which breaks the phosphodiester bond of cGMP, converting it to GMP. Inhibition of PDE5 by tadalafil increases signaling via the PKG cascade which supports penile smooth muscle relaxation during sexual arousal by decreasing Ca2+ entry into smooth muscle cells. This smooth muscle relaxation allows blood to fill the corpus cavernosum thereby producing an erection.



In PAH, blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries is raised due to a variety of mechanisms stemming from endothelial dysfunction.[A242377] Decreased production of NO and prostacyclin reduce vasodilatory signaling while overproduction of endothelin-1 and thromboxane increase vasoconstriction. Inflammation, thromboses, and hypoxia later contribute to vascular remodeling which further reduces luminal size. The resultant increase in blood pressure reduces the capacity for gas exchange and increases afterload at the right ventricle, producing symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and dizziness as well as leading to right-sided heart failure. Tadalafil exerts its therapeutic effect in PAH through boosting NO-cGMP signaling to contribute to smooth muscle relaxation as with ED.



Lastly, tadalafil is used to treat BPH.[L39095] BPH produces urinary dysfunction through hyperproliferation of the epithelial and smooth muscle layers of the prostate.[A242382] The increased size of the prostate blocks urine flow through the urethra resulting in higher residual volumes due to incomplete emptying. Tadalafil does not appear to exert its benefit via smooth muscle relaxation of the prostate. It may instead exert its effect through a mix of increased oxygenation and decreased inflammation, which decreases tissue remodeling, and inhibition of cell proliferation through the cGMP cascade.



The decreased affinity for PDE6 compared to other PDE5 inhibitors may explain the decreased incidence of visual side effects as PDE6 is present in the eye and contributes to color vision.[L39100, L39105, A242287]', 'Tadalafil exerts a therapeutic effect in ED by increasing sexual stimulation-dependant smooth muscle relaxation in the penis, allowing the corpus cavernosum to fill with blood to produce an erection.[A242287, A242377] Smooth muscle relaxation in the pulmonary vasculature helps to produce vasodilation in PAH which reduces blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries.[A242377] In BPH, tadalafil may contribute to decreased smooth muscle cell proliferation which may reduce the size of the prostate and relieve the anatomical obstruction which produces urinary symptoms of BPH.[A242382] The decreased affinity of tadalafil for PDE6 compared to other PDE5 inhibitors may explain the reduced incidence of visual side effects.[L39100, L39105, A242287]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Inhibition of DNA synthesis of virus-infected cells inhibits viral replication. In cells not infected with HSV, DNA synthesis is unaltered. Resistant mutants of HSV can occur from qualitative changes in viral thymidine kinase or DNA polymerase. The most commonly encountered acyclovir-resistant mutants that are deficient in viral thymidine kinase are also resistant to penciclovir.', 'Penciclovir is the active metabolite of the oral product famciclovir. The more favorable results observed with topical penciclovir versus topical acyclovir for the treatment of herpes labialis may be due to the longer intracellular half-life of penciclovir in HSV-infected cells. The activated drug inhibits the viral DNA polymerase. This impairs the ability of the virus to replicate within the cell.', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

A more recent systemic review and meta-analysis [A177106] indicates that memantine is beneficial as a first line drug for the treatment of Alzheimer''s dementia.  Cholinesterase inhibitors may be added to memantine for further beneficial effects on behavioral symptoms and other symptoms of dementia [A177106].', 'Continuous activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the central nervous system caused by _glutamate_ is thought to cause some of the Alzheimer''s disease symptoms. This overactivation is thought to contribute to neurotoxicity due to the excitatory properties of glutamate [T556]. The pharmacological effect of memantine likely occurs via the drug''s behavior as an uncompetitive (open-channel) NMDA receptor antagonist, preventing glutamate action on this receptor.  Memantine has a preference for the NMDA receptor-operated cation channels. Despite these antagonist effects, memantine has not been proven to prevent or retard the neurodegeneration seen in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease [FDA label].', '**General effects**



This drug inhibits calcium influx into cells that is normally caused by chronic NMDA receptor activation by glutamate [A1640]. This leads to the improvement of Alzheimer''s dementia symptoms, demonstrated by increased cognition and other beneficial central nervous system effects [A1640]. 



**Effects on neuroplasticity**



Like other NMDA receptor antagonists, memantine at high doses can reduce neuronal synaptic plasticity that is involved in learning and memory processes. At lower concentrations, which are normally used in the clinical setting, memantine can enhance neuronal synaptic plasticity in the brain, improve memory, and act as a neuroprotectant against the destruction of neurons caused by excitatory neurotransmitters [A1639]. 



**Effect on various receptors**



Memantine has demonstrated minimal activity for GABA, benzodiazepine, dopamine, adrenergic, histamine, and glycine receptors, as well as voltage-dependent Ca2+, Na+ or K+ channels. This drug has shown antagonist activity at the 5HT3 receptors.

Action on the external urinary sphincter is mediated via duloxetine''s CNS effects. Increased serotonin and norepinephrine concentrations in Onuf''s nucleus leads to increased activation of 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, and α<sub>1</sub> adrenergic receptors.[A178663,A178666] 5-HT<sub>2</sub> and α<sub>1</sub> are both G<sub>q</sub> coupled and their activation increases the activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C (IP<sub>3</sub>/PLC) pathway.[T116] This pathway leads to release of intracellular calcium stores, increasing intracellular calcium concentrations, and facilitating neuronal excitability. 5-HT<sub>3</sub> functions as a ligand-gated sodium channel which allows sodium to flow into the neuron when activated. Increased flow of sodium into the neuron contributes to depolarization and activation of voltage gated channels involved in action potential generation. The combined action of these three receptors contributes to increased excitability of the pudendal motor nerve in response to glutamate.



Also related to duloxetine''s action at the spinal cord is its modulation of pain. Increasing the concentration of serotonin and norepinephrine in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord increases descending inhibition of pain through activation of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic, and α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors.[A178705] 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, and α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic mediate neuronal activation as described above. The activated neuron in this case is the GABAergic inhibitory interneuron which synapses onto the nociceptive projection neuron to inhibit the transmission of painful stimuli to the brain. The 5-HT<sub>1</sub> and α<sub>2</sub> receptors are G<sub>i</sub>/G<sub>o</sub> coupled and their activation leads to increased potassium current through inward rectifier channels and decreased adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A signaling which contributes to neuronal inhibition.[A178705,T116] These inhibitory receptors are present on the projection neuron itself as well as the dorsal root ganglion which precedes it and serves to directly suppress the transmission of painful stimuli.



The mechanisms involved in duloxetine''s benefits in depression and anxiety have not been fully elucidated. Dysfunctional serotonin and norepinephrine signaling are thought to be involved and increases in the availability of these neurotransmitters at the synaptic cleft thought to mediate a therapeutic effect.[A178666] It is postulated that the involvement of serotonin and norepinephrine in area responsible for emotional modulation such as the limbic system contributes to the effects in mood disorders specifically but this has yet to be confirmed.



Duloxetine''s hypertensive effect is related to its intended pharmacological effect. Increased availability of norepinephrine leads to activation of adrenergic receptors on the vascular endothelium. Since the action of α<sub>1</sub> receptors predominates, vasoconstriction results as the G<sub>q</sub> coupled receptor mediates calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum to facilitate smooth muscle contraction.[T116]', 'Duloxetine, through increasing serotonin and norepinephrine concentrations in Onuf''s nucleus, enhances glutamatergic activation of the pudendal motor nerve which innervates the external urethral sphinter.[A178663,A178666] This enhanced signaling allows for stronger contraction. Increased contraction of this sphincter increases the pressure needed to produce an incontinence episode in stress urinary incontinence. Duloxetine has been shown to improve Patient Global Impression of Improvement and Incontinence Quality of Life scores.[A178669] It has also been shown to reduce the median incontinence episode frequency at doses of 40 and 80 mg.



Action at the dorsal horn of the spinal cord allows duloxetine to strengthen the the serotonergic and adrenergic pathways involved in descending inhibition of pain.[A178666,A178705] This results in an increased threshold of activation necessary to transmit painful stimuli to the brain and effective relief of pain, particularly in neuropathic pain. Pain relief has been noted in a variety of painful conditions including diabetic peripheral neuropathy, fibromyalgia, and osteoarthritis using a range of pain assessment surveys.[A178711]



While duloxetine has been shown to be effective in both animal models of mood disorders and in clinical trials for the treatment of these disorders in humans, the broad scope of its pharmacodynamic effects on mood regulation in the brain has yet to be explained.[A178714]



Increased blood pressure is a common side effect with duloxetine due to vasoconstriction mediated by the intended increase in norepinephrine signaling.[label,T116]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

It is also indicated for the prevention of major cardiovascular events (including risk of myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and coronary artery revascularization) in adult patients without documented history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events, but with at least two conventional risk factors for cardiovascular disease.[F4652]



Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]', 'Rosuvastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A181421] Rosuvastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which increases hepatic uptake of LDL. Rosuvastatin also inhibits hepatic synthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL).[F4649] The overall effect is a decrease in plasma LDL and VLDL. 



In vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that rosuvastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] This includes improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response.



Statins have also been found to bind allosterically to β2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and in T cell activation.[A181559]



Rosuvastatin exerts an anti-inflammatory effect on rat mesenteric microvascular endothelium by attenuating leukocyte rolling, adherence and transmigration.[A1807] The drug also modulates nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression and reduces ischemic-reperfusion injuries in rat hearts.[A1787] Rosuvastatin increases the bioavailability of nitric oxide[A1807,A1799,A1787] by upregulating NOS[A1791] and by increasing the stability of NOS through post-transcriptional polyadenylation.[A1796] It is unclear as to how rosuvastatin brings about these effects though they may be due to decreased concentrations of mevalonic acid.', 'Rosuvastatin is a synthetic, enantiomerically pure antilipemic agent. It is used to lower total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and trigleride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, rosuvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A181087, A181406]



Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]



**Skeletal Muscle Effects**



Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. These risks can occur at any dose level, but are increased at the highest dose (40 mg). Rosuvastatin should be prescribed with caution in patients with predisposing factors for myopathy (e.g., age ≥ 65 years, inadequately treated hypothyroidism, renal impairment).



The risk of myopathy during treatment with rosuvastatin may be increased with concurrent administration of some other lipid-lowering therapies (such as [fenofibrate] or [niacin]), [gemfibrozil], [cyclosporine], [atazanavir]/[ritonavir], [lopinavir]/ritonavir, or [simeprevir].  Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin, coadministered with [colchicine], and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together.[F4649] 



Real-world data from observational studies has suggested that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]



**Liver Enzyme Abnormalities**



Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. In most cases, the elevations were transient and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. There were two cases of jaundice, for which a relationship to rosuvastatin therapy could not be determined, which resolved after discontinuation of therapy. There were no cases of liver failure or irreversible liver disease in these trials.[F4649]



**Endocrine Effects**



Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin calcium tablets. Based on clinical trial data with rosuvastatin, in some instances these increases may exceed the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.[F4649]



An in vitro study found that [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], and [pitavastatin] exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on human pancreas islet β cells, with reductions in cell viability of 32, 41, 34 and 29%, respectively, versus control]. Moreover, insulin secretion rates were decreased by 34, 30, 27 and 19%, respectively, relative to control.[A182012]



HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and lower cholesterol levels and, as such, might theoretically blunt adrenal or gonadal steroid hormone production. Rosuvastatin demonstrated no effect upon nonstimulated cortisol levels and no effect on thyroid metabolism as assessed by TSH plasma concentration. In rosuvastatin treated patients, there was no impairment of adrenocortical reserve and no reduction in plasma cortisol concentrations. Clinical studies with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have suggested that these agents do not reduce plasma testosterone concentration. The effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on male fertility have not been studied. The effects, if any, on the pituitarygonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown.[F4652]



**Cardiovascular**



Ubiquinone levels were not measured in rosuvastatin clinical trials, however significant decreases in circulating ubiquinone levels in patients treated with other statins have been observed. The clinical significance of a potential long-term statin-induced deficiency of ubiquinone has not been established. It has been reported that a decrease in myocardial ubiquinone levels could lead to impaired cardiac function in patients with borderline congestive heart failure.[F4652]



**Lipoprotein A**



In some patients, the beneficial effect of lowered total cholesterol and LDL-C levels may be partly blunted by a concomitant increase in the Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentrations. Present knowledge suggests the importance of high Lp(a) levels as an emerging risk factor for coronary heart disease. It is thus desirable to maintain and reinforce lifestyle changes in high-risk patients placed on rosuvastatin therapy.[F4652] Further studies have demonstrated statins affect Lp(a) levels differently in patients with dyslipidemia depending on their apo(a) phenotype; statins increase Lp(a) levels exclusively in patients with the low molecular weight apo(a) phenotype.[A181418]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

It is also indicated for the prevention of major cardiovascular events (including risk of myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and coronary artery revascularization) in adult patients without documented history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events, but with at least two conventional risk factors for cardiovascular disease.[F4652]



Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]', 'Rosuvastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A181421] Rosuvastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which increases hepatic uptake of LDL. Rosuvastatin also inhibits hepatic synthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL).[F4649] The overall effect is a decrease in plasma LDL and VLDL. 



In vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that rosuvastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] This includes improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response.



Statins have also been found to bind allosterically to β2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and in T cell activation.[A181559]



Rosuvastatin exerts an anti-inflammatory effect on rat mesenteric microvascular endothelium by attenuating leukocyte rolling, adherence and transmigration.[A1807] The drug also modulates nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression and reduces ischemic-reperfusion injuries in rat hearts.[A1787] Rosuvastatin increases the bioavailability of nitric oxide[A1807,A1799,A1787] by upregulating NOS[A1791] and by increasing the stability of NOS through post-transcriptional polyadenylation.[A1796] It is unclear as to how rosuvastatin brings about these effects though they may be due to decreased concentrations of mevalonic acid.', 'Rosuvastatin is a synthetic, enantiomerically pure antilipemic agent. It is used to lower total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and trigleride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, rosuvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A181087, A181406]



Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]



**Skeletal Muscle Effects**



Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. These risks can occur at any dose level, but are increased at the highest dose (40 mg). Rosuvastatin should be prescribed with caution in patients with predisposing factors for myopathy (e.g., age ≥ 65 years, inadequately treated hypothyroidism, renal impairment).



The risk of myopathy during treatment with rosuvastatin may be increased with concurrent administration of some other lipid-lowering therapies (such as [fenofibrate] or [niacin]), [gemfibrozil], [cyclosporine], [atazanavir]/[ritonavir], [lopinavir]/ritonavir, or [simeprevir].  Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin, coadministered with [colchicine], and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together.[F4649] 



Real-world data from observational studies has suggested that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]



**Liver Enzyme Abnormalities**



Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. In most cases, the elevations were transient and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. There were two cases of jaundice, for which a relationship to rosuvastatin therapy could not be determined, which resolved after discontinuation of therapy. There were no cases of liver failure or irreversible liver disease in these trials.[F4649]



**Endocrine Effects**



Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin calcium tablets. Based on clinical trial data with rosuvastatin, in some instances these increases may exceed the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.[F4649]



An in vitro study found that [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], and [pitavastatin] exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on human pancreas islet β cells, with reductions in cell viability of 32, 41, 34 and 29%, respectively, versus control]. Moreover, insulin secretion rates were decreased by 34, 30, 27 and 19%, respectively, relative to control.[A182012]



HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and lower cholesterol levels and, as such, might theoretically blunt adrenal or gonadal steroid hormone production. Rosuvastatin demonstrated no effect upon nonstimulated cortisol levels and no effect on thyroid metabolism as assessed by TSH plasma concentration. In rosuvastatin treated patients, there was no impairment of adrenocortical reserve and no reduction in plasma cortisol concentrations. Clinical studies with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have suggested that these agents do not reduce plasma testosterone concentration. The effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on male fertility have not been studied. The effects, if any, on the pituitarygonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown.[F4652]



**Cardiovascular**



Ubiquinone levels were not measured in rosuvastatin clinical trials, however significant decreases in circulating ubiquinone levels in patients treated with other statins have been observed. The clinical significance of a potential long-term statin-induced deficiency of ubiquinone has not been established. It has been reported that a decrease in myocardial ubiquinone levels could lead to impaired cardiac function in patients with borderline congestive heart failure.[F4652]



**Lipoprotein A**



In some patients, the beneficial effect of lowered total cholesterol and LDL-C levels may be partly blunted by a concomitant increase in the Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentrations. Present knowledge suggests the importance of high Lp(a) levels as an emerging risk factor for coronary heart disease. It is thus desirable to maintain and reinforce lifestyle changes in high-risk patients placed on rosuvastatin therapy.[F4652] Further studies have demonstrated statins affect Lp(a) levels differently in patients with dyslipidemia depending on their apo(a) phenotype; statins increase Lp(a) levels exclusively in patients with the low molecular weight apo(a) phenotype.[A181418]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

These folic acid congeners are transported across cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis where they are needed to maintain normal erythropoiesis, synthesize purine and thymidylate nucleic acids, interconvert amino acids, methylate tRNA, and generate and use formate. Using vitamin B12 as a cofactor, folic acid can normalize high homocysteine levels by remethylation of homocysteine to methionine via methionine synthetase.', 'Folic acid is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin found in foods such as liver, kidney, yeast, and leafy, green vegetables. Also known as folate or Vitamin B9, folic acid is an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in DNA and RNA synthesis. More specifically, folic acid is required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. Folic acid is the precursor of tetrahydrofolic acid, which is involved as a cofactor for transformylation reactions in the biosynthesis of purines and thymidylates of nucleic acids. Impairment of thymidylate synthesis in patients with folic acid deficiency is thought to account for the defective deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis that leads to megaloblast formation and megaloblastic and macrocytic anemias. Folic acid is particularly important during phases of rapid cell division, such as infancy, pregnancy, and erythropoiesis, and plays a protective factor in the development of cancer. As humans are unable to synthesize folic acid endogenously, diet and supplementation is necessary to prevent deficiencies. In order to function properly within the body, folic acid must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted by anti-metabolite therapies such as [DB00563] as they function as DHFR inhibitors to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, and therefore prevent the formation of DHF and THF. 



In general, folate serum levels below 5 ng/mL indicate folate deficiency, and levels below 2 ng/mL usually result in megaloblastic anemia.', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

The classical interpretation of PTX''s broad effects is due to its ability to act, _in vitro_, as a non-specific cyclic-3'',5''-phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor at millimolar concentrations; specifically, it has been proposed that inhibition of PDE type III and IV isozymes leads to elevated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which mediate diverse downstream effects.[A226420, A226425, A226430] This view has been challenged, specifically by observing those plasma concentrations of PTX in routine clinical use are typically only around 1μM, far lower than those used to inhibit PDEs _in vitro_.[A226430] Instead, several studies have suggested that PTX can modulate adenosine receptor function, specifically the Gα-coupled A2A receptor (A2AR). Whether PTX acts directly as an A2AR agonist is unclear, although it can clearly increase the response of A2AR to adenosine.[A16840, A16821, A226350, A226435] A2AR activation activates adenylyl cyclase, which increases intracellular cAMP levels; this observation may explain PTX''s ability to increase intracellular cAMP in a PDE-independent fashion.[A226440]



Elevated cAMP levels have numerous downstream effects. cAMP-mediated activation of protein kinase A (PKA) suppresses nuclear translocation of NF-κB, which suppresses transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and IL-6 as well as TNF-induced molecules such as adhesion molecules (ICAM1 and VCAM1) and the C-reactive protein (CRP).[A226415, A226445, A226450, A226455] PTX has also been shown to prevent the downstream phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK, which are responsible for assembling the NADPH oxidase involved in the neutrophil oxidative burst. This effect is due to a PKA-independent decrease in Akt phosphorylation and a PKA-dependent decrease in phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK.[A226450, A226465, A226470] This transcriptional regulation at least partially explains the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties of PTX.



Also, activated PKA can activate the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which itself blocks SMAD-driven gene transcription, effectively disrupting transforming growth factor (TGF-β1) signalling.[A226440, A226475] This results in lower levels of fibrinogenic molecules such as collagens, fibronectin, connective tissue growth factor, and alpha-smooth muscle actin.[A226440, A226450, A226475, A226460] Hence, disruption of TGF-β1 signalling may explain the anti-fibrotic effects of PTX, including at least some of the decrease in blood viscosity.



The picture is complicated by the observation that PTX metabolites M1, M4, and M5 have been shown to inhibit C5 Des Arg- and formyl-methionylleucylphenylalanine-induced superoxide production in neutrophils and M1 and M5 significantly contribute to PTX''s observed hemorheological effects.[A226415, A226430, A226480] Overall, PTX administration is associated with decreased pro-inflammatory molecules, an increase in anti-inflammatory molecules such as IL-10, and decreased production of fibrinogenic and cellular adhesion molecules.', 'Pentoxifylline, a synthetic dimethylxanthine derivative structurally related to [theophylline] and [caffeine], exhibits hemorheological, anti-oxidative, and anti-inflammatory properties and is traditionally indicated in the treatment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD).

Due to its activity against prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis, ibuprofen has been attributed to alteration of platelet function and prolongation of gestation and labour.[A39092]



As ibuprofen is a widely used medication, the main therapeutic indications are:



* Patent Ductus Arteriosus - it is a neonatal condition wherein the ductus arteriosus (blood vessel that connects the main pulmonary artery to the proximal descending aorta) fails to close after birth causing severe risk of heart failure. The prostaglandin inhibition of ibuprofen has been studied for the treatment of this condition as it is known that prostaglandin E2 is responsible for keeping the ductus arteriosus open.[A39100]



* Rheumatoid- and osteo-arthritis - ibuprofen is very commonly used in the symptomatic treatment of inflammatory, musculoskeletal and rheumatic disorders.[A39176]



* Cystic fibrosis - the use of high dosages of ibuprofen has been proven to decrease inflammation and decreasing polymorphonuclear cell influx in the lungs.[A39177]



* Orthostatic hypotension - ibuprofen can induce sodium retention and antagonize the effect of diuretics which has been reported to be beneficial for patients with severe orthostatic hypotension.[A1651]



* Dental pain - ibuprofen is used to manage acute and chronic orofacial pain.[A10901]



* Pain - ibuprofen is widely used to reduce minor aches and pains as well as to reduce fever and manage dysmenorrhea. It is very commonly used for the relief of acute indications such as fever and tension headaches.[A39092] It is also used to manage mild to moderate pain and moderate to severe pain as an adjunct to opioid analgesics.[L40208]

Ibuprofen is a non-selective COX inhibitor and hence, it inhibits the activity of both COX-1 and COX-2.

The main effects reported in ibuprofen are related to the control of pain, fever and acute inflammation by the inhibition of the synthesis of prostanoids by COX-1 and COX-2. Pain relief is attributed to peripheral affected regions and central nervous system effects in the pain transmission mediated by the dorsal horn and higher spinothalamic tract. Some reports have tried to link the pain regulation with a possible enhancement on the synthesis of endogenous cannabinoids and action on the NMDA receptors. The effect on pain has been shown to be related to the cortically evoked potentials.[A39190]



The antipyretic effect is reported to be linked to the effect on the prostanoid synthesis due to the fact that the prostanoids are the main signaling mediator of pyresis in the hypothalamic-preoptic region.[A39190]



The use of ibuprofen in dental procedures is attributed to the local inhibition of prostanoid production as well as to anti-oedemic activity and an increase of plasma beta-endorphins.

The administration of ibuprofen in patients with rheumatic diseases has shown to control joint symptoms.[A39092] 



Ibuprofen is largely used in OTC products such as an agent for the management of dysmenorrhea which has been proven to reduce the amount of menstrual prostanoids and to produce a reduction in the uterine hypercontractility.[A39181] As well, it has been reported to reduce significantly the fever and the pain caused by migraines.[A39182, A39183] This effect is thought to be related to the effect on platelet activation and thromboxane A2 production which produces local vascular effects in the affected regions.

Unique among the azoles, miconazole is thought to act through three main mechanisms.[A203636] The primary mechanism of action is through inhibition of the CYP450 14α-lanosterol demethylase enzyme, which results in altered ergosterol production and impaired cell membrane composition and permeability, which in turn leads to cation, phosphate, and low molecular weight protein leakage.[A203636, A203639]



In addition, miconazole inhibits fungal peroxidase and catalase while not affecting NADH oxidase activity, leading to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).[A203636, A203639, A203642] Increased intracellular ROS leads to downstream pleiotropic effects and eventual apoptosis.[A203636]



Lastly, likely as a result of lanosterol demethylation inhibition, miconazole causes a rise in intracellular levels of farnesol. This molecule participates in quorum sensing in _Candida_, preventing the transition from yeast to mycelial forms and thereby the formation of biofilms, which are more resistant to antibiotics.[A203645, A203648] In addition, farnesol is an inhibitor of drug efflux ABC transporters, namely _Candida_ CaCdr1p and CaCdr2p, which may additionally contribute to increased effectiveness of azole drugs.[A203648]', 'Miconazole is an azole antifungal that functions primarily through inhibition of a specific demethylase within the CYP450 complex.[A203636] As miconazole is typically applied topically and is minimally absorbed into the systemic circulation following application, the majority of patient reactions are limited to hypersensitivity and cases of anaphylaxis.[L14021] Patients using intravaginal miconazole products are advised not to rely on contraceptives to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, as well as not to use tampons concurrently.[L14027]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as pantoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]



PPIs such as pantoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes [A177577, A177580].

ATPase is an enzyme on the parietal cell membrane that facilitates hydrogen and potassium exchange through the cell, which normally results in the extrusion of potassium and formation of HCl (gastric acid) [A174295].



Omeprazole is a member of a class of antisecretory compounds, the substituted _benzimidazoles_, that stop gastric acid secretion by selective inhibition of the _H+/K+ ATPase_ enzyme system. Proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole bind covalently to cysteine residues via disulfide bridges on the alpha subunit of the _H+/K+ ATPase_ pump, inhibiting gastric acid secretion for up to 36 hours [A175192].  This antisecretory effect is dose-related and leads to the inhibition of both basal and stimulated acid secretion, regardless of the stimulus [FDA label].  



**Mechanism of H. pylori eradication**



Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is frequently associated with _Helicobacter pylori_ bacterial infection (NSAIDs) [A175195]. The treatment of H. pylori infection may include the addition of omeprazole or other proton pump inhibitors as part of the treatment regimen [FDA label], [A175198]. 

_H. pylori_ replicates most effectively at a neutral pH [A175213]. Acid inhibition in H. pylori eradication therapy, including proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole, raises gastric pH, discouraging the growth of H.pylori [A175198]. It is generally believed that proton pump inhibitors inhibit the _urease_ enzyme, which increases the pathogenesis of H. pylori in gastric-acid related conditions [A175216].   ', '**Effects on gastric acid secretion**



This drug decreases gastric acid secretion [FDA label]. After oral administration, the onset of the antisecretory effect of omeprazole is usually achieved within one hour, with the maximum effect occurring by 2 hours after administration. The inhibitory effect of omeprazole on acid secretion increases with repeated once-daily dosing, reaching a plateau after four days [FDA label].



**Effects on serum gastrin**



In studies of 200 or more patients, serum gastrin levels increased during the first 1-2 weeks of daily administration of therapeutic doses of omeprazole. This occurred in a parallel fashion with the inhibition of acid secretion. No further increase in serum gastrin occurred with continued omeprazole administration. Increased gastrin causes enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and increased serum Chromogranin A (CgA) levels. The increased CgA levels may lead to false positive results in diagnostic studies for neuroendocrine tumors [FDA label].



**Enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell effects**



Human gastric biopsy samples have been obtained from more than 3000 pediatric and adult patients treated with omeprazole in long-term clinical studies. The incidence of enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia in these studies increased with time; however, no case of ECL cell carcinoids, dysplasia, or neoplasia have been identified in these patients. These studies, however, are of insufficient in power and duration to draw conclusions on the possible influence of long-term administration of omeprazole in the development of any premalignant or malignant conditions [FDA label]. 



**Other effects**



Systemic effects of omeprazole in the central nervous system, cardiovascular and respiratory systems have not been found to date. Omeprazole, given in oral doses of 30 or 40 mg for 2-4 weeks, showed no effect on thyroid function, carbohydrate metabolism, or circulating levels of parathyroid hormone, cortisol, estradiol, testosterone, prolactin, cholecystokinin or secretin [FDA label].

Haloperidol is also indicated in the short-term treatment of hyperactive children who show excessive motor activity with accompanying conduct disorders consisting of some or all of the following symptoms: impulsivity, difficulty sustaining attention, aggressivity, mood lability, and poor frustration tolerance. Haloperidol should be reserved for these two groups of children only after failure to respond to psychotherapy or medications other than antipsychotics.[F4645]', 'While haloperidol has demonstrated pharmacologic activity at a number of receptors in the brain, it exerts its antipsychotic effect through its strong antagonism of the dopamine receptor (mainly D2), particularly within the mesolimbic and mesocortical systems of the brain. Schizophrenia is theorized to be caused by a hyperdopaminergic state within the limbic system of the brain.[A34360] Dopamine-antagonizing medications such as haloperidol, therefore, are thought to improve psychotic symptoms by halting this over-production of dopamine. The optimal clinical efficacy of antipsychotics is associated with the blockade of approximately 60 % - 80 % of D2 receptors in the brain.[A34360]



While the exact mechanism is not entirely understood, haloperidol is known to inhibit the effects of dopamine and increase its turnover. Traditional antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, bind more tightly than dopamine itself to the dopamine D2 receptor, with dissociation constants that are lower than that for dopamine.[A4962] It is believed that haloperidol competitively blocks post-synaptic dopamine (D2) receptors in the brain, eliminating dopamine neurotransmission and leading to the relief of delusions and hallucinations that are commonly associated with psychosis. It acts primarily on the D2-receptors and has some effect on 5-HT2 and α1-receptors, with negligible effects on dopamine  D1-receptors. The drug also exerts some blockade of α-adrenergic receptors of the autonomic system.[L2022]



Antagonistic activity regulated through dopamine D2 receptors in the chemoreceptive trigger zone (CTZ) of the brain renders its antiemetic activity. Of the three D2-like receptors, only the D2 receptor is blocked by antipsychotic drugs in direct relation to their clinical antipsychotic abilities. 



Clinical brain-imaging findings show that haloperidol remains tightly bound to D2 dopamine receptors in humans undergoing 2 positron emission tomography (PET) scans with a 24h pause in between scans.[A4962] A common adverse effect of this drug is the development of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), due to this tight binding of haloperidol to the dopamine D2 receptor.



Due to the risk of unpleasant and sometimes lifelong extrapyramidal symptoms, newer antipsychotic medications than haloperidol have been discovered and formulated. Rapid dissociation of drugs from dopamine D2 receptors is a plausible explanation for the improved EPS profile of atypical antipsychotics such as [DB00734]. This is also consistent with the theory of a lower affinity for D2 receptors for these drugs.  As mentioned above, haloperidol binds tightly to the dopamine receptor, potentiating the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms,[A4962] and therefore should only been used when necessary.', 'Use of the first-generation antipsychotics (including haloperidol) is considered highly effective for the management of the "positive" symptoms of schizophrenia including hallucinations, hearing voices, aggression/hostility, disorganized speech, and psychomotor agitation. However, this class is limited by the development of movement disorders such as drug-induced parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, and tardive dyskinesia, and other side effects including sedation, weight gain, and prolactin changes. Compared to the lower-potency first-generation antipsychotics such as [DB00477], [DB01624], [DB00623], and [DB01403], haloperidol typically demonstrates the least amount of side effects within class, but demonstrates a stronger disposition for causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).[A180613, A180616, A180625] Low‐potency medications have a lower affinity for dopamine receptors so that a higher dose is required to effectively treat symptoms of schizophrenia. In addition, they block many receptors other than the primary target (dopamine receptors), such as cholinergic or histaminergic receptors, resulting in a higher incidence of side effects such as sedation, weight gain, and hypotension.



The balance between the wanted drug effects on psychotic symptoms and unwanted side effects are largely at play within dopaminergic brain pathways affected by haloperidol. Cortical dopamine-D2-pathways play an important role in regulating these effects and include the nigrostriatal pathway, which is responsible for causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways, which are responsible for the improvement in positive schizophrenic symptoms, and the tuberoinfundibular dopamine pathway, which is responsible for hyperprolactinemia. 



A syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome.[F4645]



Cases of sudden death, QT-prolongation, and Torsades de Pointes have been reported in patients receiving haloperidol. Higher than recommended doses of any formulation and intravenous administration of haloperidol appear to be associated with a higher risk of QT-prolongation and Torsades de Pointes. Although cases have been reported even in the absence of predisposing factors, particular caution is advised in treating patients with other QT-prolonging conditions (including electrolyte imbalance [particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia], drugs known to prolong QT, underlying cardiac abnormalities, hypothyroidism, and familial long QT-syndrome).[F4645]



A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status (including catatonic signs) and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure.[F4645]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

**General Effects**



Pantoprazole has been shown to reduce acid reflux-related symptoms, heal inflammation of the esophagus, and improve patient quality of life more effectively than histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2 blockers). This drug has an excellent safety profile and a low incidence of drug interactions. It can be used safely in various high-risk patient populations, including the elderly and those with renal failure or moderate hepatic dysfunction.[A174226]



Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as pantoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]



PPIs such as pantoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes [A177577, A177580]. 



**A note on laboratory testing abnormalities**



During treatment with antisecretory medicinal products such as pantoprazole, serum gastrin (a peptide hormone that stimulates secretion of gastric acid) increases in response to the decreased acid secretion caused by proton pump inhibition. The increased gastrin level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Published evidence suggests that proton pump inhibitors should be stopped 14 days before chromogranin A (CgA) measurements. This permits chromogranin A levels, that might be falsely elevated after proton pump inhibitor treatment, to return to the normal reference range.[F3217]

The classical interpretation of PTX''s broad effects is due to its ability to act, _in vitro_, as a non-specific cyclic-3'',5''-phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor at millimolar concentrations; specifically, it has been proposed that inhibition of PDE type III and IV isozymes leads to elevated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which mediate diverse downstream effects.[A226420, A226425, A226430] This view has been challenged, specifically by observing those plasma concentrations of PTX in routine clinical use are typically only around 1μM, far lower than those used to inhibit PDEs _in vitro_.[A226430] Instead, several studies have suggested that PTX can modulate adenosine receptor function, specifically the Gα-coupled A2A receptor (A2AR). Whether PTX acts directly as an A2AR agonist is unclear, although it can clearly increase the response of A2AR to adenosine.[A16840, A16821, A226350, A226435] A2AR activation activates adenylyl cyclase, which increases intracellular cAMP levels; this observation may explain PTX''s ability to increase intracellular cAMP in a PDE-independent fashion.[A226440]



Elevated cAMP levels have numerous downstream effects. cAMP-mediated activation of protein kinase A (PKA) suppresses nuclear translocation of NF-κB, which suppresses transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and IL-6 as well as TNF-induced molecules such as adhesion molecules (ICAM1 and VCAM1) and the C-reactive protein (CRP).[A226415, A226445, A226450, A226455] PTX has also been shown to prevent the downstream phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK, which are responsible for assembling the NADPH oxidase involved in the neutrophil oxidative burst. This effect is due to a PKA-independent decrease in Akt phosphorylation and a PKA-dependent decrease in phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK.[A226450, A226465, A226470] This transcriptional regulation at least partially explains the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties of PTX.



Also, activated PKA can activate the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which itself blocks SMAD-driven gene transcription, effectively disrupting transforming growth factor (TGF-β1) signalling.[A226440, A226475] This results in lower levels of fibrinogenic molecules such as collagens, fibronectin, connective tissue growth factor, and alpha-smooth muscle actin.[A226440, A226450, A226475, A226460] Hence, disruption of TGF-β1 signalling may explain the anti-fibrotic effects of PTX, including at least some of the decrease in blood viscosity.



The picture is complicated by the observation that PTX metabolites M1, M4, and M5 have been shown to inhibit C5 Des Arg- and formyl-methionylleucylphenylalanine-induced superoxide production in neutrophils and M1 and M5 significantly contribute to PTX''s observed hemorheological effects.[A226415, A226430, A226480] Overall, PTX administration is associated with decreased pro-inflammatory molecules, an increase in anti-inflammatory molecules such as IL-10, and decreased production of fibrinogenic and cellular adhesion molecules.', 'Pentoxifylline, a synthetic dimethylxanthine derivative structurally related to [theophylline] and [caffeine], exhibits hemorheological, anti-oxidative, and anti-inflammatory properties and is traditionally indicated in the treatment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD).

Concurrent use with [warfarin] should be associated with more frequent monitoring of prothrombin times.

This is the event that triggers the nerve impulse to the brain which allows for the perception of light. All-<i>trans</i>-retinal is then released from opsin and reduced to all-<i>trans</i>-retinol. All-<i>trans</i>-retinol is isomerized to 11-<i>cis</i>-retinol in the dark, and then oxidized to 11-<i>cis</i>-retinal. 11-<i>cis</i>-retinal recombines with opsin to re-form rhodopsin. Night blindness or defective vision at low illumination results from a failure to re-synthesize 11-<i>cis</i> retinal rapidly. Epithelial differentiation: The role of Vitamin A in epithelial differentiation, as well as in other physiological processes, involves the binding of Vitamin A to two families of nuclear retinoid receptors (retinoic acid receptors, RARs; and retinoid-X receptors, RXRs). These receptors function as ligand-activated transcription factors that modulate gene transcription. When there is not enough Vitamin A to bind these receptors, natural cell differentiation and growth are interrupted.', 'Vitamin A is effective for the treatment of Vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A refers to a group of fat-soluble substances that are structurally related to and possess the biological activity of the parent substance of the group called all-<i>trans</i> retinol or retinol.

Indicated for the treatment of persistent (non-transient) facial erythema of rosacea in adults 18 years of age or older.[L6535]', 'In the eye, alpha-1 adrenoceptors play a role in vasoconstriction, mydriasis, eyelid retraction, and elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) whereas alpha-2 adrenoceptors are responsible for IOP reduction via a complex Gi-coupled signaling cascade pathway. Activation of alpha-2 receptors leads to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and reduction of cyclic AMP levels. As a result, there is a decrease in norpinephrine (NE) release at the synaptic junction, NE-induced stimulation of beta-2 adrenoceptors, and production of aqueous humor by the ciliary epithelium.[A178969] An elevated IOP is the most significant risk factor for developing glaucomatous optic neuropathy, which is associated with progressive visual field loss and functional disability if left untreated.[A179002] Regardless of the etiology of the disease, the aim of current therapies for glaucoma is to reduce IOP, as reduction of IOP significantly reduces the risk of progression of vision loss even when IOP is already within the normal range.[A36674] When administered ophthalmically, brimonidine is rapidly absorbed into the eye, acts as an agonist at ocular alpha-2 adrenoceptors and lowers IOP via a dual mechanism of action.[A178981] It is proposed that initial dosing of the drug causes a reduction in aqueous humour production and chronic dosing leads to an increase in uveoscleral outflow.[A179002] Brimonidine does not affect episcleral venous pressure.[A178969] By reducing IOP, brimonidine aims to reduce the likelihood of glaucomatous visual field loss in ocular hypertension, and slow the progression of visual field defect in established open-angle glaucoma.[A178951] When applied topically on skin, brimonidine reduces erythema through direct vasocontriction of small arteries and veins.[A178978] As brimonidine mediates a potent peripheral vasoconstrictive activity by selectively working on the alpha-2 adrenoceptors, the use of brimonidine is thought to be efficacious for the treatment of facial erythema of rosacea, which is thought to arise from vasomotor instability and abnormal vasodilation of the superficial cutaneous vasculature of the face.[A178984]', 'Brimonidine is a highly selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist that is 1000-fold more selective for the alpha2-adrenergic receptor than the alpha1-adrenergic receptor.[L6544] This characteristic gives the drug some therapeutic advantages, since it reduces the risk of systemic side effects, such as systemic hypotension, bradycardia, and sedation. In addition, there is a reduction in the risk for developing alpha-1 mediated ocular unwanted effects, such as conjunctival blanching, mydriasis, and eyelid retraction.[A179002] However, despite high alpha-2 receptor specificity, brimonidine may still produce alpha-1 adrenoceptor-mediated ocular effects, such as conjunctival vasoconstriction.[A178969] Brimonidine has a peak ocular hypotensive effect occurring at two hours post-dosing.[label] In a randomized, double-blind clinical study, ocular administration of 0.2% brimonidine in healthy volunteers resulted in a 23% reduction of mean intraocular pressure from baseline at 3 hours following administration.[A178951] In comparative studies consisting of patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, the ocular hypotensive effect of brimonidine was maintained during treatment periods of up to 1 year.[A178945] 



Brimonidine mediates vasoconstrictive effects and it was shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory properties in _ex vivo_ human skin model and _in vivo_ inflammation models.[A179041] In a clinial trials consisting of adults with moderate to severe facial erythema of rosacea, brimonidine was shown to improve the extent of redness at 3 hours after application, compared to placebo.[L6544] It was shown to be a potent vasoconstrictor of human subcutaneous vessels with a diameter of less than 200 µm. In _in vivo_ mouse inflammation models, brimonidine displayed anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting edema.[A178978] In a randomized, double-blind study, brimonidine reduced erythema for the 12 hours of the study in a dose-dependent manner.[A178978]



When adminsitered systemically, brimonidine was shown to cause cardiovascular effects by decreasing blood pressure, decreasing heart and respiratory rate, and prolonging the PR interval in the electrocardiogram. This is due to the targeting of adrenoceptors by the drug.[A178963,A178966] Although the clinical significance has not been established, there is evidence that brimonidine exhibits neuroprotective activity in experimental models of cerebral ischemia and optic nerve injury.[A178969] _In vitro_ studies show that brimonidine mediated protective effects on neuronal cells from kainate acid insult and on cultured retinal ganglion cells from glutamate-induced cytotoxicity, which is a possible mediator of secondary neuronal degeneration in human glaucoma. Neuroprotective actions of brimonidine were also demonstrated in rat models of acute retinal ischemia and chronic IOP elevation. It has been proposed that brimonidine may exert neuroprotective effects on the retina and optic nerve by enhancing intrinsic retinal ganglion cell survival mechanisms and/or induction of neuronal survival factors, such as bFGF.[A178951] However, further investigations are needed to conclude on these possible therapeutic benefits of the drug.', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Such interaction has been reported in a study that investigated the effects of neuronal outgrowth induced by beta amyloid peptides; while amyloid peptides cause lipid disorganization within the cell membranes leading to neuronal death, piracetam demonstrated to decrease the destabilizing effects of amyloid peptide [A31534]. The authors suggest that piracetam induces a positive curvature of the membrane by occupying the polar groups in the phospholipids to counteract the negative curvature induced by amyloid peptides , which in turn would decrease the likelihood of membrane fusion [A31532]. This mechanism of action is thought to improve membrane stability, allowing the membrane and transmembrane proteins to maintain and recover the three-dimensional structure or folding for normal function [L1124] such as membrane transport, chemical secretion, and receptor binding and stimulation [A31532]. 



Through restored membrane fluidity, piracetam promotes restored neurotransmission such as glutamatergic and cholinergic systems, enhances neuroplasticity and mediates neuroprotective and anticonvulsant effects at the neuronal level [A31532]. It is also demonstrated that piracetam also improves the fluidity of platelet membranes. At the vascular level, piracetam decreases adhesion of erythrocytes to cell wall and reduces vasospasm which in turn improves microcirculation including cerebral and renal blood flow [A31532]. ', 'Piracetam is known to mediate various pharmacodynamic actions:



**Neuronal effects**: 



Piracetam modulates the cholinergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic, and glutamatergic neurotransmission although the drug does not display high affinity to any of the associated receptors (Ki >10μM). Instead, piracetam increases the density of postsynaptic receptors and/or restore the function of these receptors through stabilizing the membrane fluidity [A31532]. In the forebrain of aging mice, the density of NMDA receptors was increased by approximately 20% following 14 days of piracetam treatment. Based on the findings of various animal and human studies, the cognitive processses including learning, memory, attention and consciousness were enhanced from piracetam therapy without inducing sedation and psychostimulant effects [L1125]. Piracetam mediate neuroprotective effects against hypoxia-induced damage, intoxication, and electroconvulsive therapy [L1125]. 



In two studies involving alcohol-treated rats with evidences of withdrawal-related neuronal loss, piracetam was shown to reduce the extent of neuronal loss and increase the numbers of synapses in the hippocampus by up to 20% relative to alcohol-treated or alcohol-withdrawn rats [A31532]. This suggests that piracetam is capable in promoting neuroplasticity when recoverable neural circuits are present [A31532]. Although the mechanism of action is not fully understood, administration of piracetam prior to a convulsant stimulus reduces the seizure severity and enhances the anticonvulsant effectiveness of conventional antiepileptics such as carbamazepine and diazepam [A31535]. 



**Vascular effects**: 



Piracetam is shown to increase the deformability of erythrocytes, reduce platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent manner, reduce the adhesion of erythrocytes to vascular endothelium and capillary vasospasm. In healthy volunteers, piracetam mediated a direct stimulant effect on prostacycline synthesis and reduced the plasma levels of fibrinogen and von Willebrand’s factors (VIII: C; VIII R: AG; VIII R: vW) by 30 to 40% [L1125]. Potentiated microcirculation is thought to arise from a combination of effects on erythrocytes, blood vessels and blood coagulation [A31532]. ', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

The retention of phosphate plays a pivotal role in causing secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with osteodystrophy, and soft-tissue calcification. The mechanism by which phosphate retention leads to hyperparathyroidism is not clearly delineated. Therapeutic efforts directed toward the control of hyperphosphatemia include reduction in the dietary intake of phosphate, inhibition of absorption of phosphate in the intestine with phosphate binders, and removal of phosphate from the body by more efficient methods of dialysis. The rate of removal of phosphate by dietary manipulation or by dialysis is insufficient. Dialysis patients absorb 40% to 80% of dietary phosphorus. Therefore, the fraction of dietary phosphate absorbed from the diet needs to be reduced by using phosphate binders in most renal failure patients on maintenance dialysis. Calcium acetate when taken with meals combines with dietary phosphate to form insoluble calcium phosphate which is excreted in the feces. Maintenance of serum phosphorus below 6.0 mg/dl is generally considered as a clinically acceptable outcome of treatment with phosphate binders.

They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents.

Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P.

Therapeutic efforts directed toward the control of hyperphosphatemia include reduction in the dietary intake of phosphate, inhibition of absorption of phosphate in the intestine with phosphate binders, and removal of phosphate from the body by more efficient methods of dialysis. The rate of removal of phosphate by dietary manipulation or by dialysis is insufficient. Dialysis patients absorb 40% to 80% of dietary phosphorus. Therefore, the fraction of dietary phosphate absorbed from the diet needs to be reduced by using phosphate binders in most renal failure patients on maintenance dialysis. Calcium acetate when taken with meals combines with dietary phosphate to form insoluble calcium phosphate which is excreted in the feces. Maintenance of serum phosphorus below 6.0 mg/dl is generally considered as a clinically acceptable outcome of treatment with phosphate binders. Calcium acetate is highly soluble at neutral pH, making the calcium readily available for binding to phosphate in the proximal small intestine.', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

(1) the treatment of erectile dysfunction [A175582, L5611, F3853, F3856, F3886]; and



(2) treatment of pulmonary hypertension, where:

a) the US FDA specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO Group I) in adults to improve exercise ability and delay clinical worsening [F3850]. The delay in clinical worsening was demonstrated when sildenafil was added to background epoprostenol therapy [F3850]. Studies establishing effectiveness were short-term (12 to 16 weeks), and included predominately patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class II-III symptoms and idiopathic etiology (71%) or associated with connective tissue disease (CTD) (25%) [F3850];



b) the Canadian product monograph specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of primary pulmonary arterial hypertension (PPH) or pulmonary hypertension secondary to connective tissue disease (CTD) in adult patients with WHO functional class II or III who have not responded to conventional therapy [F3859]. In addition, improvement in exercise ability and delay in clinical worsening was demonstrated in adult patients who were already stabilized on background epoprostenol therapy [F3859]; and



c) the EMA product information specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension classified as WHO functional class II and III, to improve exercise capacity [F3883]. Efficacy has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with connective tissue disease [F3883]. The EMA label also indicates sildenafil for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years old with pulmonary arterial hypertension [F3883]. Efficacy in terms of improvement of exercise capacity or pulmonary hemodynamics has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital heart disease [F3883].', 'Sildenafil is an oral therapy for erectile dysfunction [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. In the natural setting, i.e. with sexual stimulation, it restores impaired erectile function by increasing blood flow to the penis [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].



The physiological mechanism responsible for the erection of the penis involves the release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Nitric oxide then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].



Sildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in the corpus cavernosum, where PDE5 is responsible for degradation of cGMP [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Sildenafil has a peripheral site of action on erections [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum but potently enhances the relaxant effect of NO on this tissue [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. When the NO/cGMP pathway is activated, as occurs with sexual stimulation, inhibition of PDE5 by sildenafil results in increased corpus cavernosum levels of cGMP [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Therefore sexual stimulation is required in order for sildenafil to produce its intended beneficial pharmacological effects [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].



Moreover, apart from the presence of PDE5 in the corpus cavernosum of the penis, PDE5 is also present in the pulmonary vasculature [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614]. Sildenafil, therefore, increases cGMP within pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells resulting in relaxation [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614]. In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, this can lead to vasodilation of the pulmonary vascular bed and, to a lesser degree, vasodilatation in the systemic circulation [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614].', 'In vitro studies have shown that sildenafil is selective for phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Its effect is more potent on PDE5 than on other known phosphodiesterases [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. In particular, there is a 10-times selectivity over PDE6 which is involved in the phototransduction pathway in the retina [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. There is an 80-times selectivity over PDE1, and over 700-times over PDE 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. And finally, sildenafil has greater than 4,000-times selectivity for PDE5 over PDE3, the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase isoform involved in the control of cardiac contractility [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



In eight double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies of patients with either organic or psychogenic erectile dysfunction, sexual stimulation resulted in improved erections, as assessed by an objective measurement of hardness and duration of erections (via the use of RigiScan®), after sildenafil administration compared with placebo [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Most studies assessed the efficacy of sildenafil approximately 60 minutes post-dose [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The erectile response, as assessed by RigiScan®, generally increased with increasing sildenafil dose and plasma concentration [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The time course of effect was examined in one study, showing an effect for up to 4 hours but the response was diminished compared to 2 hours [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



Sildenafil causes mild and transient decreases in systemic blood pressure which, in the majority of cases, do not translate into clinical effects [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg, three times a day to patients with systemic hypertension the mean change from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was a decrease of 9.4 mmHg and 9.1 mmHg respectively [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg, three times a day to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension lesser effects in blood pressure reduction were observed (a reduction in both systolic and diastolic pressure of 2 mmHg)[F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614] . At the recommended dose of 20 mg three times a day no reductions in systolic or diastolic pressure were seen [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



Single oral doses of sildenafil up to 100 mg in healthy volunteers produced no clinically relevant effects on ECG [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg three times a day to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension no clinically relevant effects on the ECG were reported either [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



In a study of the hemodynamic effects of a single oral 100 mg dose of sildenafil in 14 patients with severe coronary artery disease (CAD) (> 70 % stenosis of at least one coronary artery), the mean resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased by 7 % and 6 % respectively compared to baseline [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Mean pulmonary systolic blood pressure decreased by 9% [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Sildenafil showed no effect on cardiac output and did not impair blood flow through the stenosed coronary arteries [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



Mild and transient differences in color discrimination (blue/green) were detected in some subjects using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test at 1 hour following a 100 mg dose, with no effects evident after 2 hours post-dose [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The postulated mechanism for this change in color discrimination is related to inhibition of PDE6, which is involved in the phototransduction cascade of the retina [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Sildenafil has no effect on visual acuity or contrast sensitivity. In a small size placebo-controlled study of patients with documented early age-related macular degeneration (n = 9), sildenafil (single dose, 100 mg) demonstrated no significant changes in visual tests conducted (which included visual acuity, Amsler grid, color discrimination simulated traffic light, and the Humphrey perimeter and photostress test) [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

The contraction of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent on the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells by specific ion channels. Amlodipine blocks calcium ion influx across cell membranes with selectivity. A stronger effect of amlodipine is exerted on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells [FDA label]. Direct actions of amlodipine on vascular smooth muscle result in reduced blood pressure [F3757]. 



**Mechanism of action in angina**



The exact mechanism by which amlodipine relieves the symptoms of angina have not been fully elucidated to this date, however, the mechanism of action is likely twofold:



Amlodipine has a dilating effect on peripheral arterioles, reducing the total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the cardiac muscle functions. Since the heart rate remains stable during amlodipine administration, the reduced work of the heart reduces both myocardial energy use and oxygen requirements [F3757].



Dilatation of the main coronary arteries and coronary arterioles, both in healthy and ischemic areas, is another possible mechanism of amlodipine reduction of blood pressure. The dilatation causes an increase in myocardial oxygen delivery in patients experiencing coronary artery spasm (Prinzmetal''s or variant angina) and reduces coronary vasoconstriction caused by smoking [F3757].', '**General pharmacodynamic effects**



Amlodipine has a strong affinity for cell membranes, modulating calcium influx by inhibiting selected membrane calcium channels. This drug''s unique binding properties allow for its long-acting action and less frequent dosing regimen [A573], [FDA label].  



**Hemodynamic effects**



After the administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine to patients diagnosed with hypertension, amlodipine causes vasodilation, which results in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressure. During these blood pressure reductions, there are no clinically significant changes in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with long-term use. Acute intravenous administration of amlodipine reduces arterial blood pressure and increases heart rate in patients with chronic stable angina, however, chronic oral administration of amlodipine in clinical studies did not cause clinically significant alterations in heart rate or blood pressures in patients diagnosed with angina and normal blood pressure. With long-term, once daily oral administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours [FDA label]. 



**Electrophysiologic effects**



Amlodipine does not change sinoatrial (SA) nodal function or atrioventricular (AV) conduction in animals or humans. In patients who were diagnosed with chronic stable angina, the intravenous administration of 10 mg of amlodipine did not cause clinically significant alterations A-H and H-V conduction and sinus node recovery time after cardiac pacing. Patients administered amlodipine with concomitant beta-blockers produced similar results. In clinical trials in which amlodipine was given in combination with beta-blockers to patients diagnosed with hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were noted. In clinical studies comprised of angina patients alone, amlodipine did not change electrocardiographic intervals or produce high degrees of AV block [FDA label]. 



**Effects on angina**



Amlodipine relieves the symptoms of chest pain associated with angina. In patients diagnosed with angina, daily administration of a single amlodipine dose increases total exercise time, the time to angina onset, and the time to 1 mm ST-segment depression on ECG studies, decreases anginal attack frequency, and decreases the requirement for nitroglycerin tablets [F3757].

In particular, CysLT-mediated airway bronchoconstriction, occluding mucous secretion, vascular permeability, and eosinophil recruitment are all types of effects that facilitate asthma.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Alternatively, in allergic rhinitis, CysLTs are released by the nasal mucosa when exposed to allergens during both early and late phase reactions and participate in eliciting symptoms of allergic rhinitis like a congested nose and airway.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]



Subsequently, montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that binds with high affinity and selectivity to the CysLT type 1 receptor, which consequently assists in inhibiting any physiological actions of CysLTs like LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 at the receptor that may facilitate asthma or allergic rhinitis.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]', 'Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that demonstrates a marked affinity and selectivity to the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor type-1 in preference to many other crucial airway receptors like the prostanoid, cholinergic, or beta-adrenergic receptors.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] As a consequence, the agent can elicit substantial blockage of LTD4 leukotriene-mediated bronchoconstriction with doses as low as 5 mg.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Moreover, a placebo-controlled, crossover study (n=12) demonstrated that montelukast is capable of inhibiting early and late phase bronchoconstriction caused by antigen challenge by 75% and 57% respectively.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]



In particular, it has been documented that montelukast can cause bronchodilation as soon as within 2 hours of oral administration.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] This action can also be additive to the bronchodilation caused by the concomitant use of a beta agonist.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Nevertheless, clinical investigations performed with adults 15 years of age and older revealed that no additional clinical benefit is obtained when doses of montelukast greater than 10 mg a day are used.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]



Additionally, in clinical trials with adults and pediatric asthmatic patients aged 6 to 14 years, it was also determined that montelukast can reduce mean peripheral blood eosinophils by about 13% to 15% from baseline in comparison to placebo during double-blind treatment periods.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] At the same time, in patients aged 15 years and older who were experiencing seasonal allergic rhinitis, the use of montelukast caused a median reduction of 13% in peripheral blood eosinophil counts when compared to placebo as well.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]', 'Pitavastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A181421] Pitavastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which increase hepatic uptake of LDL, thereby reducing circulating LDL-C levels. 



In vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that statins exert vasculoprotective effects independent of their lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] This includes improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response.



Statins have also been found to bind allosterically to β2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and in T cell activation.[A181559]', 'Pitavastatin is an oral antilipemic agent which inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. It is used to lower total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and trigleride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, rosuvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A181087, A181406]



Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]



**Skeletal Muscle Effects**



Pitavastatin may cause myopathy (muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness with creatine kinase (CK) above ten times the upper limit of normal) and rhabdomyolysis (with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria). Rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis with statin use, including pitavastatin. Predisposing factors for myopathy include advanced age (≥65 years), female gender, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. In most cases, muscle symptoms and CK increases resolved when treatment was promptly discontinued. As dosages of pitavastatin greater than 4mg per day were associated with an increased risk of severe myopathy, the product monograph recommends a maximum daily dose of 4mg once daily.[L48616]



The risk of myopathy during treatment with pitavstatin may be increased with concurrent administration of interacting drugs such as [fenofibrate], [niacin], [gemfibrozil], and [cyclosporine].  Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors coadministered with [colchicine], and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together.[L48616]



Real-world data from observational studies has suggested that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]



**Hepatic Dysfunction**



Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with pitavastatin. In most cases, the elevations were transient and either resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including pitavastatin.[L48616]



Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury.[L48616]

Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]



**Skeletal Muscle Effects**



Pitavastatin may cause myopathy (muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness with creatine kinase (CK) above ten times the upper limit of normal) and rhabdomyolysis (with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria). Rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis with statin use, including pitavastatin. Predisposing factors for myopathy include advanced age (≥65 years), female gender, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. In most cases, muscle symptoms and CK increases resolved when treatment was promptly discontinued. As dosages of pitavastatin greater than 4mg per day were associated with an increased risk of severe myopathy, the product monograph recommends a maximum daily dose of 4mg once daily.[L48616]



The risk of myopathy during treatment with pitavstatin may be increased with concurrent administration of interacting drugs such as [fenofibrate], [niacin], [gemfibrozil], and [cyclosporine].  Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors coadministered with [colchicine], and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together.[L48616]



Real-world data from observational studies has suggested that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]



**Hepatic Dysfunction**



Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with pitavastatin. In most cases, the elevations were transient and either resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including pitavastatin.[L48616]



Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury.[L48616]



**Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels**



Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with statins, including pitavastatin. Optimize lifestyle measures, including regular exercise, maintaining a healthy body weight, and making healthy food choices.[L48616]



An in vitro study found that [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], and [pitavastatin] exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on human pancreas islet β cells, with reductions in cell viability of 32, 41, 34 and 29%, respectively, versus control. Moreover, insulin secretion rates were decreased by 34, 30, 27 and 19%, respectively, relative to control.[A182012]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

It has been shown that hydroxychloroquine accumulates in the lysosomes of the malaria parasite, raising the pH of the vacuole.[A183074] This activity interferes with the parasite''s ability to proteolyse hemoglobin, preventing the normal growth and replication of the parasite.[A183074] Hydroxychloroquine can also interfere with the action of parasitic heme polymerase, an enzyme that uses ferriprotoporphyrin IX (FP) released from hemoglobin as a substrate to form beta-hematin. By reducing the activity of heme polymerase without inhibiting the release of FP, hydroxychloroquine leads to the accumulation of FP in a toxic form.[A183080]



Hydroxychloroquine accumulation in human organelles also raise their pH, which inhibits antigen processing, prevents the alpha and beta chains of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II from dimerizing, inhibits antigen presentation of the cell, and reduces the inflammatory response.[A183074] Elevated pH in the vesicles may alter the recycling of MHC complexes so that only the high affinity complexes are presented on the cell surface.[A183074] Self peptides bind to MHC complexes with low affinity and so they will be less likely to be presented to autoimmune T cells.[A183074] Hydroxychloroquine also reduces the release of cytokines like interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor, possibly through inhibition of Toll-like receptors.[A183074,A198852]



The raised pH in endosomes, prevent virus particles (such as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) from utilizing their activity for fusion and entry into the cell.[A191625]



Hydroxychloroquine inhibits terminal glycosylation of ACE2, the receptor that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 target for cell entry.[A191628,A191625] ACE2 that is not in the glycosylated state may less efficiently interact with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, further inhibiting viral entry.[A191625]', 'Hydroxychloroquine affects the function of lysosomes in humans as well as plasmodia.[A183074] Altering the pH of the lysosomes reduces low-affinity self-antigen presentation in autoimmune diseases and interferes with the ability of plasmodia to proteolyze hemoglobin for their energy requirements.[A183074] Hydroxychloroquine has a long duration of action as it may be taken on a weekly basis for some indications.[L8072] Hydroxychloroquine may lead to severe hypoglycemia and so diabetic patients are advised to monitor their blood glucose levels.[L8072]

IVIg also impacts different effector cells of the immune system (B and T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, etc.) and regulates a wide range of genes. Its main mechanism of actions are believed to be Fc-dependent and F(ab'')2-dependent. IVIg competitively blocks gamma Fc receptors, preventing the binding and ingestion of phagocytes and suppressing platelet depletion. IVIg contains a number of different antobodies, which prevent infection by attaching to the surface of invading pathogens and aiding in their disposal before they can infect cells. Antibodies remove pathogens via complement activation, agglutination or precipitation, pathogen receptor blocking, macrophage “tagging” or neutralization (via binding) of pathogen toxins. Intact IVIg and F(ab′)2 fragments of IVIg can also neutralize the activity of various autoantibodies. By triggering the production of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, IVIg modulates of the production of cytokines and cytokine antagonists. It also prevents the generation of the C5b-9 membrane attack complex and subsequent complement-mediated tissue damage by binding active complement components.', 'Used as a replacement therapy in inherited humoral immunodeficiency disorders such as severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome, x-linked agammaglobulinemia, and Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome.

', 'Felodipine decreases arterial smooth muscle contractility and subsequent vasoconstriction by inhibiting the influx of calcium ions through voltage-gated L-type calcium channels. It reversibly competes against nitrendipine and other DHP CCBs for DHP binding sites in vascular smooth muscle and cultured rabbit atrial cells. Calcium ions entering the cell through these channels bind to calmodulin. Calcium-bound calmodulin then binds to and activates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Activated MLCK catalyzes the phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain subunit of myosin, a key step in muscle contraction. Signal amplification is achieved by calcium-induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through ryanodine receptors. Inhibition of the initial influx of calcium decreases the contractile activity of arterial smooth muscle cells and results in vasodilation. The vasodilatory effects of felodipine result in an overall decrease in blood pressure. Felodipine may be used to treat mild to moderate essential hypertension.', 'Felodipine belongs to the dihydropyridine (DHP) class of calcium channel blockers (CCBs), the most widely used class of CCBs. There are at least five different types of calcium channels in Homo sapiens: L-, N-, P/Q-, R- and T-type. It was widely accepted that CCBs target L-type calcium channels, the major channel in muscle cells that mediates contraction; however, some studies have shown that felodipine also binds to and inhibits T-type calcium channels. T-type calcium channels are most commonly found on neurons, cells with pacemaker activity and on osteocytes. The pharmacologic significance of T-type calcium channel blockade is unknown. Felodipine also binds to calmodulin and inhibits calmodulin-dependent calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The effect of this interaction appears to be minor.  Another study demonstrated that felodipine attenuates the activity of calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (CaMPDE) by binding to the PDE-1B1 and PDE-1A2 enzyme subunits. CaMPDE is one of the key enzymes involved in cyclic nucleotides and calcium second messenger systems. Felodipine also acts as an antagonist to the mineralcorticoid receptor by competing with aldosterone for binding and blocking aldosterone-induced coactivator recruitment of the mineralcorticoid receptor.
