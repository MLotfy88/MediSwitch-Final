Orthostatic hypotension with or without syncope, in rare cases accompanied by profound collapse and cardiorespiratory arrest, has occurred during initiation of clozapine treatment alone and in combination with other psychotropic agents, occasionally even on the first dose. Anticholinergic effects of these agents may also be additively increased. Excessive anticholinergic effects may result in paralytic ileus, hyperthermia, heat stroke, and the anticholinergic intoxication syndrome.', 'DDInter', 'Caution is advised when clozapine is initiated in patients receiving other psychotropic drugs, including risperidone. Vital signs should be closely monitored. Patients who have had even a brief interval off clozapine (i.e., 2 or more days since the last dose) should be restarted with 12.5 mg once or twice daily. Conversely, pharmacologic response and plasma clozapine levels should be monitored more closely whenever risperidone is added to or withdrawn from therapy in patients stabilized on clozapine, and the dosage adjusted as necessary. In addition, the potential for additive effects on the QT interval and increased risk of torsade de pointes arrhythmia should be considered. Serum electrolytes, including potassium, magnesium and calcium, should be measured at baseline and periodically during treatment, and any abnormalities corrected prior to initiating treatment. Routine ECG assessment may detect QTc prolongation but is not always effective in preventing arrhythmias. Therapy with these agents should be discontinued if the QTc interval exceeds 500 msec. Patients should be advised to seek prompt medical attention if they experience symptoms that could indicate the occurrence of torsade de pointes such as dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, palpitation, irregular heart rhythm, shortness of breath, or syncope. Ambulatory patients may want to avoid activities requiring mental alertness until they know how these agents affect them. A dosage reduction in one or both drugs may be necessary if excessive adverse effects develop.', 'Metabolism, Synergism', 'Caution is advised when clozapine is initiated in patients receiving other psychotropic drugs, including risperidone.', 'Major', 'pharmacodynamic', NULL, 'https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/72587/', '', 'Risperidone', 'Clozapine', 1767369485);
