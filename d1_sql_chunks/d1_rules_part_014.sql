Symptoms of hypoglycemia such as tremor and tachycardia may be absent, making it more difficult for patients to recognize an oncoming episode. Specifically, inhibition of catecholamine-mediated glycogenolysis and glucose mobilization in association with beta-blockade can potentiate insulin-induced hypoglycemia in diabetics and delay the recovery of normal blood glucose levels. Prolonged and severe hypoglycemia may occur, although these events have rarely been reported. Significant increases in blood pressure and bradycardia can also occur during hypoglycemia in diabetics treated with insulin and beta-blockers due to antagonism of epinephrine''s effect on beta-2 adrenergic receptors, which leads to unopposed alpha-adrenergic effects including vasoconstriction.
