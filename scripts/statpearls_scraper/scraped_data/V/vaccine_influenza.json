    "indications": "The following are contraindications to receiving the influenza vaccine. However, clinicians should check the prescribing information of the vaccine before administration.\n\nHistory of severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine\nInfants younger than 6 months of age\n\nAdditionally, LAIV is contraindicated in the following populations:\n\nChildren or adolescents on concomitant aspirin/salicylate-containing medicine\nChildren aged 2 to 4 years age with asthma or reported wheezing/asthma in the preceding 12 months or whose health record  notes wheezing episodes in the preceding 12 months\nChildren/adults who are immunocompromised due to any cause, including but not limited to medications, anatomic asplenia, congenital or acquired immunodeficiency states, functional asplenia (eg, due to sickle-cell anemia), or HIV infection\nClose contacts/caregivers of severely immunosuppressed persons requiring a protected environment\nPregnant women\nIndividuals with active communication between the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the nasopharynx, oropharynx, nose, ear, or any other cranial CSF leak\nPersons with cochlear implants (due to the potential for CSF leak)\nAdministration of influenza antiviral drugs within the previous 17 days for baloxavir, 5 days for peramivir, and 48 hours for oseltamivir/zanamivir\n\nPrecautions\n\n• Moderate/severe acute illness with or without fever• History of Guillain-Barré syndrome(GBS) within 6 weeks of receipt of influenza vaccine\n[15]\n\nLAIV has additional precautions for recipients with asthma aged 5 years and older. Precautions are warranted for patients with medical conditions that might predispose them to complications from influenza (eg, cardiovascular [except isolated hypertension], chronic pulmonary, hepatic, renal, neurologic, metabolic [including diabetes mellitus], or hematologic disorders).\n\nEgg Allergy\n\nIndividuals who have experienced only hives after exposure to eggs may get the influenza vaccine (ie, any IIV4, RIV4, or LAIV4) appropriate for their health status and age.\nPersons reporting angioedema, respiratory distress, lightheadedness, or recurrent emesis or who require epinephrine or another emergency medical intervention may also get the influenza vaccine that is otherwise recommended. If a vaccine other than RIV4 or ccIIV4 is selected, it should be administered in an outpatient/inpatient medical setting, supervised by a clinician to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions.",
    "mechanism": "Influenza viruses express 2 types of antigens: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Influenza A virus has 18 HA and 11 NA subtypes, and these antigens are critical for the organism's virulence. The trimeric hemagglutinin glycoprotein promotes attachment of the virus to the host cell surface, resulting in fusion and thereby releasing virions into the cytoplasm.\n[1]\n\nDifferently combined HA and NA antigens are seen in influenza A, which undergo antigenic drifts and shifts resulting in antigenic variation and, thereby, the necessity for vaccine strain types to vary accordingly. Antigenic drifts are genetic changes occurring in the virus due to various actions of polymerases leading to gradual antigenic changes in both HA and NA, producing new variant strains. An antigenic shift occurs when the currently circulating virus disappears and is replaced by a new subtype with novel glycoproteins, to which antibodies against the previously circulating subtype do not cross-react.\n[6]\n\nThe influenza vaccine conveys immunity against the influenza virus by stimulating the production of antibodies specific to the disease. Antibodies to NA act by effectively aggregating viruses on the cell surface and reducing the amount of virus released from infected cells. Regarding the induction of immunity, the surface HA protein of the influenza virus contains 2 structural elements, head and stalk, wherein the head is the primary target of antibodies that confer protective immunity against influenza viruses.\n[1]\n\nFlu shots offer protection against 3 or 4 strains of the flu virus. Trivalent flu vaccines provide protection against 2 influenza A strains, H1N1 and H3N2, and 1 influenza B strain. Quadrivalent flu vaccines protect against the same strains as the trivalent vaccine and an additional strain of influenza B.\n[7]\n\nIn the US, mainly, 3 types of influenza vaccines are available: Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (IIV), Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV), and Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV).\nNumerals after letters indicate valency (the number of influenza viruses represented), ie, 3 for trivalent vaccines and 4 for quadrivalent vaccines.\nWhile prefixes are sometimes used to refer to specific IIVs: a for adjuvanted IIV (eg, aIIV4) and cc for cell culture-based IIV (eg, ccIIV4).\n\nThe mechanism of immune protection is more complicated, as while primarily humoral, cell-mediated immunity also plays an essential role in immunity to influenza. After vaccination, it takes 2 weeks to build an immune response against the flu. The effectiveness of a vaccine depends on several host factors such as age, underlying health status, genetic status, and antigenic matches between the vaccine and circulating viruses.\n[8]",
    "administration": "Timing of Immunization:\nFor most individuals requiring only 1 dose of influenza vaccine for the season, the vaccine should be administered during September or October. However, vaccination should continue as long as influenza viruses are circulating. Vaccination during July and August is not suggested for most individuals. However, an individualized case evaluation is necessary.\n\nFor adults older than 65 years and pregnant women in the first or second trimester, vaccination during July and August is not recommended unless there is concern that subsequent vaccination might not be feasible.\nAdministration in July and August can be considered in the third trimester of pregnancy.\nChildren aged 6 months through 8 years requiring 2 doses should be administered the first dose as soon as possible.\nImmunization during July and August can be considered for children of any age requiring only 1 dose.\n\nInfluenza vaccine administration can vary with both the dose form and the patient's age.\n\nDosage Forms:\nFlu shots are available in several forms.\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\nThese include the following:\n\nIntramuscular vaccine\nHigh-dose vaccine (age 65 years and older)\nIntradermal vaccine (age 18 to 64 years)\nEgg-free vaccine (age 4 years and older)\nNasal spray (age 2 to 49 years)\nA needle-free vaccine as a jet injector (age 18 to 64 years)\n\nDosage:\nApproved ages and dose volume for IM influenza vaccines (IIV4s and RIV4): Determine the number of doses needed for a child based on the age, the time of the first dose of the current influenza vaccine, and the number of doses of influenza vaccine received in prior seasons.\n\nAge 6 months to 3 years: 0.25 ml-0.5 ml, depending on the vaccine\nNot previously vaccinated or influenza vaccination history unknown: 2 doses, 4 weeks apart.\nVaccinated the previous season with 2 doses 4 weeks or more apart before July 1 of the current season: 1 dose needed\nAge 3 to 8 years: 0.5 ml\nNot previously vaccinated or influenza vaccination history unknown: 2 doses, 4 weeks apart.\nVaccinated the previous season with 2 doses four weeks or more apart before July 1 of the current season: 1 dose needed\nAge 8 years: 0.5 ml;  for a child aged 8 years who needs 2 doses, both doses should be given even if the recipient turns 9 years of age between dose 1 and dose 2.\nAge 9 years and older\n[12]\n: Single-dose; 0.5 ml\nAge 65 and older: Single-dose; 0.5 ml-0.7 ml, depending on the vaccine.\nACIP recommends that the recipient preferentially receive 1 of the higher doses (quadrivalent HD-IIV4 or quadrivalent RIV4) or adjuvanted influenza vaccine (quadrivalent aIIV4).\nIf none of these 3 options are available at an opportunity for vaccination, then any other age-appropriate influenza vaccine should be used.\n\nWhen a dose less than the necessary volume is administered in error, follow the ACIP/CDC recommendations below.\n\nWhen an error is found immediately (before the recipient has left the vaccination setting), inject the remaining additional volume needed.\nIf the error is discovered after the recipient has left the vaccination setting or it is not easy to measure the remaining needed volume, inject a repeat of the full dose. A healthy, nonpregnant individual aged 2 to 49 years may alternatively be given 0.2 mL of quadrivalent Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV4), 0.1 mL in each nostril, using the supplied intranasal sprayer.\n\nIIVs/RIV4:\nThese vaccines are administered intramuscularly (IM). For adults/older children, the deltoid muscle, and for infants/younger children, the anterolateral thigh is the preferred injection site.\n\nLAIV4:\nIt is administered intranasally using a single-use sprayer prefilled containing 0.2 mL of vaccine. The recipient must be upright, and half of the total sprayer contents must be sprayed into the first nostril. Then, the attached divider clip is removed, and the second half of the dose is administered into the other nostril.\n\nRecipient sneezing immediately after administration does not warrant dose repetition.\nIf a patient has nasal congestion that may interfere with the complete dose delivery to the nasopharyngeal mucosa, deferral should be considered, or another appropriate vaccine should be administered.\n\nPregnancy Considerations:\nQuadrivalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccines (IIV4) or quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines (RIV4) may be administered in any trimester. LAIV4 should not be used during pregnancy but can be used postpartum.\n[13]\n\nPersons with Chronic Medical Conditions:\nThe LAIV4 vaccine is not recommended for individuals with some chronic medical conditions.\n\nImmunocompromised Persons:\nAge-appropriate IIV4 or RIV4 is recommended for these individuals. LAIV4 should not be administered in these patients. Immune response might decrease or decrease in individuals on certain medications, chemotherapy, or transplant regimens. Adjusting the timing of the flu vaccine relative to a specified period before or after an intervention that compromises immunity may be appropriate. Guidance regarding the timing of vaccination in such cases is published by The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA).\n\nCaregivers and High-Risk Contacts:\nAny age-appropriate IIV4 or RIV4 is recommended for caregivers and high-risk contacts (including those of immunosuppressed persons). LAIV4 may be administered to caregivers/contacts of individuals not severely immunocompromised (ie, who do not require a protected environment). Healthcare personnel and hospital visitors who received LAIV4 should avoid contact with a severely immunosuppressed individual who requires a protected environment for 7 days after vaccination.\n\nVaccination for Travelers:\n\nTravelers who intend to decrease the risk of influenza should consider vaccination 2 weeks or more before departure.\nIndividuals at higher risk for complications of influenza who were not vaccinated during the prior fall or winter should be considered for influenza vaccination administration before departure if planning to travel to the tropics, on cruise ships, organized tourist groups, or to the Southern Hemisphere during April-September.\nIt is important to note that Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccines may differ in viral composition from Northern Hemisphere vaccine formulations.\nImmunization with the Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine before Southern Hemisphere travel might be acceptable; however, these vaccine formulations are usually unavailable in the US.",
    "adverse_effects": "Adverse Events:\n\nInjection site reactions\nFever\nIrritability\nDrowsiness\nMyalgia\nUpper and lower respiratory symptoms, headache, and vomiting are specific to the nasal spray\n\nRare effects of the influenza vaccine include allergic reactions and urticaria/anaphylaxis.\n[14]\n\nInactivated flu and pneumococcal vaccines administered simultaneously may increase the risk for febrile seizures.\n\nDrug Interactions\n\nInfluenza antivirals can decrease the efficacy of LAIV4  if administered before or after LAIV4. Therefore, individuals who have been prescribed antivirals should be revaccinated with an age-appropriate RIV4 or IIV4. Recommendations for the use of antivirals are given below. It is important to note that the period may be prolonged in the presence of renal insufficiency, which delays the clearance of the drug.\n[5]\n\nOseltamivir and zanamivir 48 hours before to 2 weeks following LAIV4\nBaloxavir 17 days before to 2 weeks following LAIV4\nPeramivir 5 days before to 2 weeks following LAIV4\n\nAdministration with Other Vaccines\n\nIIV4 and RIV4 may be administered concurrently/sequentially with other inactivated/live vaccines. However, injectable vaccines given at the same time should be administered at separate anatomic sites.\nClinicians should refer to the latest CDC/ACIP recommendations/guidance for COVID-19 vaccines and administering influenza vaccines.\nThe LAIV4 vaccine may be administered simultaneously with other live or inactivated vaccines. If not given simultaneously, administer 4 weeks or more apart between the administration of LAIV4 and another live vaccine.\nThe safety and immunogenicity of simultaneous or sequential administration of 2 vaccines containing non-aluminum adjuvants have not yet been studied.",
    "monitoring": "The CDC and FDA continuously monitor vaccine safety and will inform health officials, clinicians, and the public when necessary.\n\nThe CDC uses 3 systems of vaccine safety monitoring:\n\nThe Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS): an early warning system that helps the CDC and FDA monitor problems following vaccination.  Anyone can report possible vaccine side effects to VAERS.\nThe Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD): a collaborative effort between the CDC and 9 other healthcare organizations that allows ongoing monitoring and proactive searches of vaccine-related data.\nThe Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) Project: a partnership between the CDC and several medical centers conducting clinical research on vaccine-associated health risks.\n[16]",
    "toxicity": "The vaccine does not manifest any dose-dependent toxicity.\n\nDespite extensive studies, no toxicity regarding carcinogenicity and infertility has been found.\n\nThe components of the influenza vaccine are the following:\n\nFormaldehyde which is used to inactivate toxins from viruses and bacteria.\nThimerosal which safeguards against contamination and is only present in multi-dose vials.\nAluminum salts which act as adjuvants and impart a more robust immune response.\nGelatin which is present as a stabilizer.\nAntibiotics, such as gentamicin or neomycin, which are present in the flu vaccine to keep bacteria from growing.\n\nToxicity does not exist due to the inconspicuous amounts of these components in the vaccine.\n[17]\n[18]"
