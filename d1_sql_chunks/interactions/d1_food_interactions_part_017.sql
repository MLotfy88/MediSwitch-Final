Resistance to oral anticoagulants has been associated with consumption of foods or enteral feedings high in vitamin K content.  Likewise, a reduction of vitamin K intake following stabilization of anticoagulant therapy may result in elevation of the INR and bleeding complications.  Foods rich in vitamin K include beef liver, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, collard greens, endive, kale, lettuce, mustard greens, parsley, soy beans, spinach, Swiss chard, turnip greens, watercress, and other green leafy vegetables.  Moderate to high levels of vitamin K are also found in other foods such as asparagus, avocados, dill pickles, green peas, green tea, canola oil, margarine, mayonnaise, olive oil, and soybean oil.  Snack foods containing the fat substitute, olestra, are fortified with 80 mcg of vitamin K per each one ounce serving so as to offset any depletion of vitamin K that may occur due to olestra interference with its absorption.  Whether these foods can alter the effect of oral anticoagulants has not been extensively studied.  One small study found that moderate consumption (1.5 servings/day) does not significantly affect the INR after one week in patients receiving long-term anticoagulation.', 'food high in vitamin K', 'Moderate', 'Intake of vitamin K through supplements or diet should not vary significantly during oral anticoagulant therapy.  The diet in general should remain consistent, as other foods containing little or no vitamin K such as mangos and soy milk have been reported to interact with warfarin.  Some experts recommend that continuous enteral nutrition should be interrupted for one hour before and one hour after administration of the anticoagulant dose and that enteral formulas containing soy protein should be avoided.  Patients should also consider avoiding or limiting the consumption of cranberry juice or other cranberry formulations (e.g., encapsulated dried cranberry powder), pomegranate juice, black currant juice, and black currant seed oil.', '', '', 'DDInter', 0);
