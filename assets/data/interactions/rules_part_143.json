Patients should be observed for a period of six hours after the first dose for signs and symptoms of bradycardia with hourly pulse and blood pressure measurement.

Additional observation is recommended if the heart rate 6 hours postdose is less than 45 bpm or is at the lowest value postdose, or if the ECG 6 hours postdose shows new onset second-degree or higher AV block.  Should postdose symptomatic bradycardia occur, initiate appropriate management, begin continuous ECG monitoring, and continue observation until the symptoms have resolved.

Some studies suggest a lower risk for iso-osmolar contrasts compared to low-osmolar contrasts, although data are limited.  Serum creatinine levels should be measured before contrast administration (if procedure is not urgent) and continued for 24 to 48 hours after.  In addition, patients should be adequately hydrated with either intravenous normal saline or sodium bicarbonate starting 3 (outpatient) to 6 (inpatient) hours before and continued for 6 to 24 hours after procedure.  Oral fluids are also beneficial, but not as effective as intravenous hydration.  N-acetylcysteine the day before and day of contrast administration, or theophylline up to 30 minutes before contrast administration, have also been used in high-risk or critically ill patients.  Preferably, a nephrologist should be consulted to optimize prophylactic measures for preventing contrast-induced nephropathy in high-risk patients and to guide treatment if the condition occurs.

The risk of hypocalcemia may also be increased, as drug-induced renal tubular damage can lead to renal loss of calcium and other electrolytes such as magnesium. Bisphosphonates alone often cause mild, asymptomatic hypocalcemia via inhibitive effects on bone resorption and possibly chelation of blood calcium.

In vivo, 4'-O-methylpyridoxine competes with vitamin B6, which causes an indirect inhibition of glutamate decarboxylase and subsequent decrease in the formation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain.

      "severity": "Major",
      "effect": "Coadministration with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding associated with the use of deferasirox. Theoretical concerns exist regarding the potential for increased risk of renal impairment during coadministration of deferasirox with other nephrotoxic agents, including NSAIDs when used chronically or in high dosages.",
      "management_text": "Caution is advised if deferasirox is used in combination with NSAIDs. Patients should be advised to contact their physician if they develop potential signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal injury such as abdominal pain, bloating, dizziness, lightheadedness, vomiting blood, anorexia, or black, tarry stools. Serum creatinine and/or creatinine clearance should be closely monitored (e.g., prior to initiation of deferasirox therapy, then weekly during the first month after initiation or modification of therapy and monthly thereafter), especially in the elderly and patients with preexisting renal impairment, comorbid conditions, dehydration, or severe infections. Dosage reduction, interruption, or discontinuation should be considered in the presence of creatinine elevations. A progressive increase in serum creatinine beyond the age-appropriate upper limit of normal may warrant an interruption of therapy. Once the creatinine has returned to within the normal range, therapy may be reinitiated at a lower dose followed by a gradual dose escalation according to the product labeling, provided the clinical benefit is expected to outweigh potential risks.",

      "severity": "Major",
      "effect": "Coadministration of inotersen with other nephrotoxic agents may increase the risk of renal impairment due to additive adverse effects on the kidney. Inotersen can cause glomerulonephritis that may result in dialysis-dependent renal failure.",
      "management_text": "Caution is advised when inotersen is prescribed with nephrotoxic drugs and other drugs that may impair renal function (e.g., aminoglycosides; polypeptide, glycopeptide, and polymyxin antibiotics; amphotericin B; aminosalicylates; antiviral/antiretroviral agents such as acyclovir, adefovir, cidofovir, foscarnet, ganciclovir, and tenofovir; antineoplastics such as aldesleukin, cisplatin, clofarabine, ifosfamide, streptozocin, and high intravenous dosages of methotrexate; chelating agents such as deferasirox, deferoxamine, edetate disodium, and edetate calcium disodium; immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine, everolimus, sirolimus, and tacrolimus; intravascular contrast media; intravenous bisphosphonates; intravenous pentamidine; high dosages and/or chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents; gallium nitrate; lithium; penicillamine) . Serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR), and a urinalysis should be obtained prior to initiation of inotersen and regularly during and for at least 8 weeks after treatment in accordance with the product labeling. Inotersen should generally not be initiated in patients with a UPCR of 1000 mg/g or higher, or in patients who are unable to adhere to the recommended laboratory monitoring and management guidelines. Patients or their caregivers should be apprised of the signs and symptoms of glomerulonephritis and to seek medical attention if they occur, including edema, shortness of breath, coughing, hematuria, and decreased urination.",
