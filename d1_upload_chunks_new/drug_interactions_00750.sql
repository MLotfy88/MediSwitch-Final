In general, patients receiving chronic therapy with such agents should not be treated with natalizumab due to potentially increased risk of PML and other serious infections. Typical symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body, clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes.
