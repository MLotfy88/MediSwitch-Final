Although grapefruit juice is an inhibitor of CYP450 3A4 and quinine is metabolized by this pathway to its major metabolite, 3-hydroxyquinine, a study of ten healthy volunteers found no significant differences in quinine peak plasma concentration (Cmax), time to reach Cmax (Tmax), terminal elimination half-life, systemic exposure (AUC), or apparent oral clearance (Cl/F) when a single 600 mg oral dose of quinine sulfate was administered in combination with 200 mL of orange juice (control), half-strength grapefruit juice, and full-strength grapefruit juice twice daily for 6 days each, separated by a 2-week washout period.  Relative to the control period, the apparent renal clearance of quinine was markedly increased by 81% during treatment with half-strength grapefruit juice.  However, since renal clearance accounts for approximately 6% of the total clearance of quinine, this change would likely have minimal clinical impact.  The lack of a significant interaction is probably due to the fact that grapefruit juice primarily inhibits intestinal rather than hepatic CYP450 3A4, and quinine is not known to undergo significant presystemic metabolism as evidenced by its relatively high oral bioavailability (76% to 88%).  Nevertheless, excessive consumption of grapefruit juice and tonic water (which contains quinine) was suspected as the cause of torsade de pointes arrhythmia in a patient with a history of asymptomatic long QT syndrome.

Elevated liver transaminases, hepatitis, jaundice/cholestasis, hepatic failure, and acute hepatic necrosis have been reported with the use of leflunomide.

Patients with preexisting liver disease or elevated baseline liver enzymes (i.e., ALT greater than two times ULN) should not receive leflunomide or teriflunomide.

Follow-up monitoring should be conducted at least weekly until the ALT value is within normal range, and washout procedures repeated as necessary.
