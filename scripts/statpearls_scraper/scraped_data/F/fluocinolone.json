    "toxicity": "Managing the toxicity and adverse effects of treatment for sympathetic ophthalmia is an important aspect of patient care. Treatment regimens, particularly those involving long-term corticosteroid use and immunosuppressive agents, can lead to various side effects. Here are general strategies for managing such complications:\n\nCorticosteroid-Induced Side Effects\n\nOsteoporosis prevention\n: Calcium, vitamin D supplements, and bone density monitoring\nHyperglycemia control:\nBlood sugar level monitoring and collaborating with a primary care physician for diabetes management\nIncreased infection risk:\nEducate patients on signs of infection; possibly prescribe prophylactic antibiotics for specific situations\nCataract and glaucoma:\nRegular eye examinations, pressure monitoring, and surgeries as needed\n\nImmunosuppressive Drug Monitoring\n\nLiver and kidney function:\nRegular blood tests to monitor liver enzymes and kidney function due to the potential hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity of medications like methotrexate and cyclosporine\nBlood dyscrasias:\nComplete blood counts to monitor for anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia\nInfection surveillance:\nPatients on immunosuppressive therapy are more susceptible to opportunistic infections\n\nBiologic Agents\n\nInjection site reactions:\nLocal care and possibly adjusting the administration technique\nRisk of reactivation of tuberculosis\n: Screening for tuberculosis before starting therapy with biologic agents, particularly TNF-α inhibitors\nDemyelinating disorders:\nNeurological assessment for any new-onset neurological symptoms\n\nGeneral Health Maintenance\n\nNutritional support:\nA balanced diet may help manage weight and maintain overall health.\nPhysical activity:\nEncourage weight-bearing exercises to maintain bone density and muscle strength.\nPsychosocial support:\nAccess to mental health professionals to address any psychological effects of chronic illness and vision loss is important.\n\nPatient Education\n\nMedication adherence:\nStress the importance of not abruptly stopping medications to avoid acute rebound effects.\nAdverse effect awareness:\nEducate patients about potential adverse effects and when to seek medical help.\n\nTreating clinicians must tailor management plans based on the specific medications used and the patient’s overall health profile. Regular and comprehensive monitoring for side effects can mitigate the risks associated with treating sympathetic ophthalmia.\n[125]\n[126]\n[127]\n[128]\n[129]"
