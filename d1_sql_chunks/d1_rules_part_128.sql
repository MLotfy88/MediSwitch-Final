Patients treated with pexidartinib should have liver function tests, including AST, ALT, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, ALP, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), prior to initiation of pexidartinib, weekly for the first 8 weeks, every 2 weeks for the next month, and every 3 months thereafter. Pexidartinib therapy may require a dosage reduction, to be withheld, or permanently discontinued based on the severity of the hepatotoxicity. A recurrence of increased serum transaminases, bilirubin, or ALP may occur upon rechallenge with a reduced dose of pexidartinib. Liver function tests should be performed weekly for the first month after rechallenge. Patients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience potential signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as fever, rash, itching, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, malaise, right upper quadrant pain, dark urine, pale stools, and jaundice.', 'Synergism', 'Carisoprodol, Orphenadrine, Baclofen, Cyclobenzaprine, Methocarbamol, Chlormezanone', 'Entrectinib, Imatinib, Pralsetinib, Dabrafenib, Asciminib, Acalabrutinib, Dacomitinib, Pacritinib, Tepotinib, Fedratinib, Avapritinib, More', 'Major', NULL, 'DDInter', 'pharmacodynamic', NULL, 'https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/64400/', '[1] "Product Information.

Follow-up monitoring should be conducted at least weekly until the ALT value is within normal range, and washout procedures repeated as necessary. All patients treated with leflunomide or teriflunomide should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience potential signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as fever, rash, itching, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, malaise, right upper quadrant pain, dark urine, pale stools, and jaundice.', 'Synergism', 'Carisoprodol, Orphenadrine, Baclofen, Methocarbamol, Chlormezanone', 'Golimumab, Cyclosporine, Ustekinumab, Antithymocyte immunoglobulin (rabbit), Tocilizumab, Secukinumab, Canakinumab, Anifrolumab, Ravulizumab, Diroximel fumarate, Mycophenolic acid, More', 'Major', NULL, 'DDInter', 'pharmacodynamic', NULL, 'https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/64449/', '[1] EMEA "EMEA public statement on leflunomide (ARAVA) - severe and serious hepatic reactions.
