    "clinical_significance": "The interprofessional team should consider the patient’s age and future reproductive or lactation plans whenever breast surgery is contemplated. Patients should receive counseling regarding the risks and benefits of surgical and nonsurgical breast interventions and their potential impact on future breastfeeding, enabling informed decision-making.\n[16]\nThe healthcare team should also evaluate the effects of medications on colostrum, breastfeeding, and neonatal suckling. Patients require thorough counseling on indications, interactions, and potential adverse effects for both the patient and the neonate.\n[17]\n[18]\nThe interprofessional team should provide education on the significance of colostrum for neonatal health and support early breastfeeding experiences to optimize breastfeeding outcomes and promote neonatal well-being."
