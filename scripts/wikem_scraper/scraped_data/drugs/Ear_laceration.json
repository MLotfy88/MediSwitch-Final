One of several types may be used:\nHead Wrap Technique\nApply petroleum soaked gauze the the wound and use it to pack the helix. Apply gauze posterior to the ear and another generous wad covering the ear entirely. Compress this dressing tightly to the head by wrapping gauze or coban around the circumference of the head.\nBolster Technique\nSandwich the wound area between two cotton rolls or small rolls of gauze. Snugly suture these into place by piercing through and through the pinna\nEar splint Technique\nCreate a small plaster roll, wet it to activate it, and coat it with a small amount of cotton webril dressing to prevent sticking. Press the splint firmly in place and place a wad of gauze posterior to the ear. Apply several layers of gauze over the ear and employ a wrap or beanie hat to hold the dressing in place\n[2]",
