    "clinical_significance": "Many healthcare quality metrics assess the effectiveness of diabetes prevention and treatment. Obesity is a significant risk factor for T2D, influencing both its development and severity. Early screening of patients with obesity, combined with intensive therapy, can lead to long-term improvement or remission. Strict diabetes control reduces complications such as ketoacidosis, diabetic ulcers, amputations, soft tissue infections, and osteomyelitis. Additionally, aggressive management of HbA1c lowers the risk of coronary artery disease and chronic kidney disease.",
    "monitoring": "Members of the interprofessional team caring for patients with diabetes and obesity monitor HbA1c, body weight, BMI, and lifestyle changes at every visit. Clinicians educate patients about potential adverse effects of medication and adjust doses as needed, and pharmacists reinforce this counseling and manage medication reconciliation. After metabolic surgery, patients require close monitoring by the healthcare team. Although surgical patients require fewer medications because of improved metabolic parameters, they have a higher risk of hypoglycemia. Nurses identify and document complications such as wound dehiscence, perforation, and signs of infection, and promptly alert physicians and other prescribing clinicians. Clinicians, dietitians, and nutritionists assess for signs of metabolic derangements, including vitamin and mineral deficiencies or malabsorption syndromes. Avoiding continuous use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs during the first month helps prevent erosion of anastomosis sites. Internal quality metrics evaluate remission rates, procedural safety, postoperative recovery, and long-term outcomes after surgery.\n\nObesity increases the risk of T2D, cardiovascular disease, and numerous other chronic health conditions. Effective healthcare teams routinely screen for obesity and diabetes, using BMI to assess the severity of obesity. ILI and pharmacological therapy aim for at least 10% weight loss. Patients who do not achieve adequate weight loss or glycemic control despite optimal medical treatment should be referred for bariatric surgery. Over the past 2 decades, these procedures have become increasingly safe and effective. Continued postoperative monitoring by the interprofessional team is essential for early detection of complications and sustained clinical improvement."
