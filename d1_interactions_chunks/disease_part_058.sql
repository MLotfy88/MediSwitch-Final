In general, oral or long-acting formulations of these drugs should not be used in the early management of AMI because of the difficulty in precisely controlling and rapidly terminating their hemodynamic effects should adverse reactions occur.  Sublingual and other immediate- onset nitrates or nitrites should typically be avoided in suspected AMI with marked bradycardia or tachycardia, and should be used with extreme caution, if at all, in patients with right ventricular or inferior wall infarction.  Rarely, sublingual nitroglycerin has produced hypotension accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia in patients with AMI and especially right ventricular infarction.  The latter group of patients are also particularly dependent on adequate right ventricular preload to maintain cardiac output and can experience profound hypotension with nitrate or nitrite administration due to reduction of right ventricular preload.', '3', 'Scardi S, Zingone B, Pandullo C "Myocardial infarction following sublingual administration of isosorbide dinitrate."
