These symptoms may be followed by sharp shooting pains or severe continuous burning pain if the drug is not withdrawn, and progress to severe pain requiring narcotic analgesics.

Since the development of peripheral neuropathy appears to be dose-related, the recommended dosage of zalcitabine should not be exceeded. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue zalcitabine therapy and contact their physician if neuropathy develops.

      "management_text": "Until more information is available, concomitant use of remdesivir with known hepatotoxic drugs should be avoided when possible. Liver function should be evaluated prior to starting remdesivir and monitored during treatment as clinically appropriate. Remdesivir should not be initiated in patients with ALT greater than or equal to 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) at baseline. Likewise, remdesivir should be discontinued immediately if ALT increases to 5 times ULN or greater during treatment (may be restarted when ALT falls below 5 times ULN), or if ALT elevation is accompanied by signs or symptoms of liver inflammation or increasing conjugated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, or INR.",
