    "clinical_significance": "Basic adult hygiene includes oral hygiene, bathing, eliminating, shaving, brushing, and styling hair. These may seem like basic procedures but are vital to maintaining the patient’s health. It is important to stay up to date with the nursing literature to be effective at assisting the patient.\n\nThe inability to properly maintain hygienic conditions for patients can lead to many adverse effects. Patients who have suffered a stroke need assistance maintaining proper oral hygiene to prevent outcomes like aspiration pneumonia or opportunistic infections.\n[5]\nBathing patients regularly, particularly those in the intensive care unit, can help prevent gram-negative infections.\n[6]\nAssisting patients with elimination can prevent\nClostridium difficile\ninfections.\n[7]\nThese hygienic practices work as preventative measures to help patients maintain their health.",
    "monitoring": "Patients should receive continuous monitoring for proper hygiene. The frequency of assisting patients depends on the patient’s medical status and the patient’s cultural and personal beliefs. Some patients may have a preference for when to perform specific hygienic tasks. For example, patients who follow the Islamic religion may prefer to wash their bodies before praying and may prefer to use water over hand sanitizer when washing their hands.\n[13]\nThose who practice Buddhism may prefer to bathe before bed.\n\nIt is also essential to monitor the patient when assisting with hygienic tasks. For example, bathing the patient is an opportunity to check for lesions or bed sores. Helping patients with elimination is an opportunity to monitor for signs of a\nClostridium difficile\ninfection. If a patient is suspected of having infectious diarrhea, they should undergo evaluation for the cause of infection and isolated to prevent infecting other patients. The provider should wear a gown and gloves while assisting patients with hygienic tasks in the perineal area.\n[7]\nA combination of current evidence-based practices, open communication with the patient to discover their preferences, and frequent monitoring allows for the best care possible for the patient."
