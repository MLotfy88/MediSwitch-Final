Clozapine and low- potency agents such as chlorpromazine and thioridazine tend to exhibit the greatest degree of anticholinergic effects in the class, while haloperidol as well as the newer, atypical agents like quetiapine, risperidone and ziprasidone have generally been associated with very low frequencies of anticholinergic adverse effects.  Therapy with neuroleptic agents should be administered cautiously in patients with preexisting conditions that are likely to be exacerbated by anticholinergic activity, such as urinary retention or obstruction; angle-closure glaucoma, untreated intraocular hypertension, or uncontrolled primary open-angle glaucoma; and gastrointestinal obstructive disorders.', '2', '', 'DDInter', 0);
