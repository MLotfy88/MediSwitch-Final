Otherwise, some experts recommend discontinuing diuretics 1 to 2 days before administration of contrast media, depending on the clinical feasibility of doing so. The smallest effective dose of a nonionic, hypo- or iso-osmolar contrast medium (e.g., iohexol, iodixanol, iopamidol) should be used, since the risk of nephropathy is increased with increasing contrast dose and/or osmolarity. Repeat procedures with contrast media, if necessary, should not occur until at least 72 hours after the previous contrast exposure and renal function has fully recovered. Although it is not necessary to measure the serum creatinine levels of every patient before contrast administration, measurements should generally be made in patients receiving contrast agent by intraarterial administration (which is associated with increased risk of nephropathy relative to intravenous administration) and patients with a history of kidney disease, proteinuria, kidney surgery, diabetes, hypertension, gout, or other risk factors for nephropathy. Creatinine measurements should be continued for 24 to 48 hours after administration of contrast medium.
