In addition to enhanced pharmacologic effects, high levels of statin or HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity in plasma is also associated with an increased risk of musculoskeletal toxicity. Myopathy manifested as muscle pain and/or weakness associated with grossly elevated creatine kinase exceeding ten times the upper limit of normal has been reported occasionally. Rhabdomyolysis has also occurred rarely, which may be accompanied by acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria and may result in death. An analysis of the data from available clinical trials found that patients on diltiazem treated concomitantly with simvastatin 80 mg/day have a slightly increased risk (approximately 1% incidence) of myopathy. The risk in patients taking simvastatin 40 mg/day was not increased by concomitant diltiazem.', NULL, 'Simvastatin dosage should not exceed 10 mg daily when used in combination with diltiazem.', NULL, 'Simvastatin dosage should not exceed 10 mg daily when used in combination with diltiazem. The benefits of this combination should be carefully weighed against the potentially increased risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis. Fluvastatin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin are probably safer alternatives in patients receiving diltiazem, since they are not metabolized by CYP450 3A4. All patients receiving statin therapy should be advised to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by fever, malaise and/or dark colored urine. Therapy should be discontinued if creatine kinase is markedly elevated in the absence of strenuous exercise or if myopathy is otherwise suspected or diagnosed.', 'Metabolism, Synergism', NULL, NULL, 'Major', NULL, 'DDInter', 'pharmacodynamic', 1767317475);
