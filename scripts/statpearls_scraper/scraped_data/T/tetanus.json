Fever is more common in routine vaccinations when administered with concurrent vaccines.\n[13]\nAnaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema, and neurologic complications have been reported following tetanus vaccine administration but are rare. Contraindications are an anaphylactic reaction to the previous dose and encephalopathy not attributed to other causes within 7 days of the previously given dose. Precautions should be considered for Guillain-Barre syndrome within 6 weeks of the previous dose, history of Arthus-type reaction, or underlying neurologic conditions."
