In addition, symptomatic hypotension can occur in susceptible individuals, which may compromise renal and myocardial perfusion.  In patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF), treatment with AR antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and, rarely, renal failure, myocardial ischemia, and death.  Therapy with AR antagonists should be initiated cautiously in patients with severe CHF, especially when accompanied by volume and/or sodium depletion.  In patients who experience a decline in renal function, discontinuation of AR antagonist therapy is usually not required provided there is symptomatic improvement of the heart failure and renal deterioration is well-tolerated.  Transient hypotension is also not a contraindication to further treatment with AR antagonists, since therapy can usually be reinstated without difficulty after blood pressure stabilizes.', '2', 'Weber MA, Byyny RL, Pratt JH, Faison EP, Snavely DB, Goldberg AI, Nelson EB "Blood pressure effects of the angiotensin II receptor blocker, losartan."
