      "text": "Used by first responders to quickly classify victims during a mass casualty incident (MCI) based on the severity of their injury\nUnlike standard medical triage, MCI triage is more utilitarian (i.e. the greatest good for the greatest number of people)\nMultiple triage systems exist, however evidence regarding their effectiveness is lacking\n[1]\nIn an effort to update and standardize MCI triage, the Model Uniform Core Criteria (MUCC) were created as a national guideline for MCI triage\n[2]\nThese criteria have been endorsed by all major national shareholders, including NAEMSP, ACEP, ACS, NAEMT, NASEMSO, AMA, CDC, and others.\nCurrently, the SALT triage system is the only one that meets the Model Uniform Core Criteria",
