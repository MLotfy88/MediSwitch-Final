    "clinical_significance": "The concentration of each heavy metal is given with a reference range provided by the testing laboratory. It is important to note that reference values may vary by the lab and geography.\n[61]\n[62]\nWhile an average concentration in the general population might be considered “normal,” this doesn’t imply that these concentrations have no health consequences. OSHA and EPA continuously change guidelines for acceptable exposure limits. Alternatively, an “abnormal” heavy metal screen does not automatically constitute toxicity. However, if presented with a higher-than-average metal concentration, further investigation should be conducted about possible sources of exposure and any presence of symptoms."
