    "indications": "The contraindications for lumbar plexus block are similar to other regional anesthesia techniques:\n\nPatient refusal\nAllergy to local anesthetics\nLocal infection\nSystemic anticoagulation (INR >1.5 or inadequate time since cessation of anticoagulant)\n\nRelative contraindications or where one might consider an alternative technique:\n\nPresence of intrathecal pump or spinal cord stimulator\nMajor lumbar spine deformity\nPrior major spine surgery, implanted hardware, fusion\nPreexisting neurologic deficit",
    "clinical_significance": "The lumbar plexus block is considered an advanced regional anesthesia technique that, for many years, has proven efficacy. Concerns about safety, particularly in centers with a great deal of experience and where it is standard practice, seem much overblown. From the experience of the authors, the lumbar plexus block used as part of multimodal analgesia for lower limb surgery is a powerful and reliable tool for postoperative pain management. The lumbar plexus block decreases opioid consumption, enhances patient comfort, and promotes postoperative ambulation and physical therapy. It can play a pivotal role in enhanced recovery programs for hip surgery. Knowledge of the anatomy of the lumbar plexus, the different techniques of the block, its indications, and contraindications are considered essential for every practicing anesthesiologist and acute pain physician."
