The mechanism involves increased airway resistance and reduced bronchodilation due to blockade of beta-2 adrenergic receptors. The interaction may also occur with ophthalmically applied beta-blockers, which are systemically absorbed and can produce clinically significant systemic effects even at low or undetectable plasma levels. Due to opposing effects on beta-2 adrenergic receptors, propranolol has been used in the treatment of albuterol overdose. Likewise, beta-2 adrenergic agonists may interfere with the pharmacologic effects of beta-blockers.', NULL, 'Concomitant use of beta-2 adrenergic bronchodilators with beta-blockers, including ophthalmic formulations, should generally be avoided.', NULL, 'Concomitant use of beta-2 adrenergic bronchodilators with beta-blockers, including ophthalmic formulations, should generally be avoided. If coadministration is required, a cardioselective beta-blocker (e.g., acebutolol, atenolol, betaxolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol, nebivolol) is usually preferred. Nevertheless, caution is advised and respiratory status should be closely monitored, as cardioselectivity is not absolute and larger doses of beta-1 selective agents may pose some of the same risks as nonselective agents.
