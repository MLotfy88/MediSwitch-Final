This may be due to fluid retention, occult/gross blood loss, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis.  Hemoglobin or hematocrit should be monitored in patients with any signs/symptoms of anemia or blood loss, especially during long-term therapy.  NSAIDs may increase risk of bleeding events; comorbid conditions (e.g., coagulation disorders; concomitant use of warfarin/other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, serotonin/serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) may increase this risk, and patients with these conditions should be monitored for signs of bleeding.  Therapy with NSAIDs should be administered cautiously in patients with or predisposed to anemia.  Clinical monitoring of hematopoietic function may be appropriate, particularly during chronic therapy.', '2', '', 'DDInter', 0);
