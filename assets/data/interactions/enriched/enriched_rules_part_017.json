Since ACE inhibitors decrease the breakdown of kinins, it is conceivable that they may potentiate these reactions. Anaphylactic-type reactions, including fatalities, have followed the parenteral administration of iron dextran. Such reactions occur most often within the first several minutes of administration and are generally characterized by sudden onset of respiratory difficulty and/or cardiovascular collapse.

Resuscitation techniques and personnel trained in the detection and treatment of anaphylactic-type reactions should be readily available.

Although anaphylactic reactions are usually evident within a few minutes, observe patients for at least one hour before administering the remainder of the therapeutic dose.

The mechanism involves increased airway resistance and reduced bronchodilation due to blockade of beta-2 adrenergic receptors. The interaction may also occur with ophthalmically applied beta-blockers, which are systemically absorbed and can produce clinically significant systemic effects even at low or undetectable plasma levels. Due to opposing effects on beta-2 adrenergic receptors, propranolol has been used in the treatment of albuterol overdose. Likewise, beta-2 adrenergic agonists may interfere with the pharmacologic effects of beta-blockers.",
      "management_text": "Concomitant use of beta-2 adrenergic bronchodilators with beta-blockers, including ophthalmic formulations, should generally be avoided. If coadministration is required, a cardioselective beta-blocker (e.g., acebutolol, atenolol, betaxolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol, nebivolol) is usually preferred. Nevertheless, caution is advised and respiratory status should be closely monitored, as cardioselectivity is not absolute and larger doses of beta-1 selective agents may pose some of the same risks as nonselective agents.
