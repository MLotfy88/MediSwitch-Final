      "text": "Missle Embolization is an umbrella term encompassing the intravasculature and intracardiac embolization of bullet fragments, pellets, and shrapnel most commonly from war related penetrating traumas (mortars, grenades, mines, etc.)\n[1]\n.\nA rare phenomenon with the majority of cases occurring in war/combat penetrating trauma, although civilian cases have been reported\n[2]\n.\nDefinitive recommendations regarding management and treatment are varied.",

    "Clinical_Features": {
      "text": "Commonly present with asymmetric peripheral pulses, evidence of metallic fragments remote from the site of penetrating injury (outside of the expected fragment trajectory), and lack of an exit wound\n[2]\n.\nHowever, patient presentation can vary. Hemodynamically stable vital signs, lack of penetrating trauma on a pulseless extremity, and the presence of an exit wound should not be used to exclude the diagnosis.\nAs delayed and occult arterial injury have been reported in the literature, serial imaging may be necessary if suspicion remains high in the absence of initial findings.",
