Adverse events, especially hypokalemia, may be more likely with systemic or nebulized formulations of beta-2 agonists or high dosages of theophylline. Beta-2 agonists can cause clinically significant but usually transient decreases in serum potassium concentrations, while hypokalemia associated with theophylline often occurs in toxicity. Pharmacokinetically, some beta-2 agonists given systemically may decrease the plasma concentrations of theophylline.",
      "management_text": "Although theophylline and beta-2 agonists are commonly used together to produce bronchodilation, it may be appropriate to monitor patient response as well as serum potassium level, blood pressure and heart rate during coadministration, especially if the beta-2 agonist is administered systemically or by nebulizer. Close monitoring is particularly important in patients with severe asthma, since the potential increases in blood pressure and heart rate may have more serious consequences in the presence of hypoxemia or hypercapnia due to increased myocardial oxygen consumption. Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they experience worsening of their respiratory condition or potential signs and symptoms of hypokalemia such as fatigue, weakness, myalgia, muscle cramps, numbness, tingling, abdominal pain, constipation, palpitation, and irregular heartbeat.",

A pharmacokinetic study evaluating the effects of a single dose of either albendazole (400 mg) (n=8) or mebendazole (1000 mg) (n=8) administered with ritonavir (200 mg twice daily for 8 days) in healthy, nonsmoking male Caucasian subjects reported a significant reduction in the systemic exposure (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of both albendazole and mebendazole. Specifically, mean AUC decreased to 27% and 43% of baseline for albendazole and mebendazole, respectively, and Cmax decreased to 26% and 41% of baseline, respectively. Albendazole sulfoxide AUC and Cmax were reduced to 41% and 52% of baseline, respectively. By contrast, pharmacokinetic parameters for albendazole, mebendazole, and albendazole sulfoxide were not significantly altered following administration of ritonavir for 2 doses only. The clinical relevance of the interaction observed following chronic ritonavir administration is unknown, since therapeutic ranges to optimize efficacy have not been established for either albendazole or mebendazole. Clinical impact is expected to be minimal in the treatment of intestinal infections, but may be increased when albendazole or mebendazole is used for systemic helminthic diseases.",

The risk of systemic anticholinergic effects following topical administration depends on variables such as strength of the product, size of the application area, frequency of application, and use of occlusive dressing.  Systemic effects are uncommon following oral inhalation or nasal administration due to the poor absorption of quaternary ammonium compounds from gastrointestinal and nasal mucosa.",

Caution is advised if concomitant use cannot be avoided, particularly in the elderly and those with significantly impaired renal and/or hepatic function.  Measures should be taken whenever possible to minimize ocular exposure to these drugs, such as keeping eyes closed during oral inhalation, use of a mouthpiece rather than face mask during nebulization, and not touching the eyes following topical application until hands are washed with soap and water.  Patients should be advised to contact their physician if they experience excessive anticholinergic adverse effects or signs and symptoms of angle-closure glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort; blurred vision; visual halos; colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion or corneal edema).",
