Antihypertensive agents such as diuretics may potentiate the orthostatic effect that is occasionally observed upon the initiation of SSRI or SNRI therapy. Syncope and orthostatic hypotension tend to occur within the first week of SNRI/SSRI therapy but can occur at any time during treatment, particularly after a dosage increase.

More severe and/or acute cases may include hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. Discontinuation of SSRI/SNRI therapy should be considered in patients who develop symptomatic hyponatremia, and appropriate medical intervention instituted as necessary. Patients should also have their blood pressure and pulse monitored before and during SSRI/SNRI therapy, especially during the first few weeks and following a dosage increase.
