    "indications": "Bilirubinuria is the presence of bilirubin in the urine. It can be detected by the standardized urine dipstick, mostly referred to as urinalysis in most hospitals worldwide. Bilirubin and related breakdown metabolites are well known for causing the characteristic coloring in bile and stool; however, its presence in the urine is not normal, and for it to be present there, it must be water-soluble and excreted by the kidney. Bilirubin in the body exists as either conjugated/direct or unconjugated/indirect. Unconjugated bilirubin is soluble in fat but insoluble in water and thus cannot be renally excreted. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is characterized by acholuric jaundice as urine is not darkened by urinary bilirubin as bilirubin is not detected in the urine in such cases. On the other hand, conjugated bilirubin is water-soluble and thus can be renally excreted and detected in the urine. Patients may describe their urine as tea or cola-colored when they have jaundice and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to liver or biliary disease. In a healthy individual with normal liver function and bile duct anatomy, bilirubin is not detectable in the urine. Therefore, bilirubinuria is a marker of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and can be the earliest sign of hepatic or biliary disease.\n[1]",
    "mechanism": "Bilirubin metabolism occurs in three phases: prehepatic, intrahepatic, and post-hepatic. Bilirubin is conjugated and becomes water-soluble in the liver and is then excreted through the biliary and cystic ducts to either become stored in the gallbladder or pass through the duodenum. Hence conjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs when there is a disease process that affects the hepatic and post-hepatic phase of bilirubin metabolism.\n\nIntrahepatic causes of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia include:\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n\nHepatocellular disease\n\nViral hepatitis (Hepatitis A-E)\nAlcoholic liver disease (alcoholic steatosis, alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis)\nNon-alcoholic steatohepatitis\nAutoimmune hepatitis\nWilson disease\nHemochromatosis\n\nHereditary causes\n\nDubin-Johnson syndrome\nRotor syndrome\n\nPrimary biliary cirrhosis\n\nIschemic hepatitis\n\nSarcoidosis\n\nPregnancy\n\nDrug-induced liver injury\n\nSepsis\n\nExtrahepatic causes of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia include\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n\nIntrinsic to the ductal system\n\nGallstones\nBiliary stricture\nBiliary atresia\nCholedochal cyst\nCholangitis (bacterial, recurrent pyogenic, primary sclerosing, secondary sclerosing)\nCholangiocarcinoma\nIntrahepatic malignancy\n\nExtrinsic to the ductal system\n\nExtrahepatic malignancy (lymphoma, pancreatic cancer)\nChronic pancreatitis",
    "monitoring": "Evaluation of bilirubinuria is performed using a standard urinalysis. In the urine, a chemical strip with a diazonium salt that reacts with bilirubin is used to produce a red azo dye, with the saturation corresponding to the bilirubin value. False negatives can be associated with urinary nitrates, acidic urine with a pH below 5.5, antibiotic use, which decreases the intestinal flora, oxidation by vitamin C, (as bilirubin will not react with the diazonium salts). False positives can be associated with highly colored substances that can mask the results such as phenazopyridine, indicans, chlorpromazine, or etodolac metabolites which cause reddish discoloration of urine. There is no definitive approach for bilirubinuria, A suggested algorithm approach to positive urine bilirubin can be summarized in the diagram below in figure 1.\n[19]\n[20]",
    "administration": "The treatment of bilirubinuria is targeted towards the different clinical etiologies responsible for the laboratory abnormality. Liver biopsy is st times needed to determine the cause of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia if blood tests and clinical history do not provide the answer.\n\nERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) is an effective diagnostic and therapeutic procedure performed in patients with bilirubinuria and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia caused by the presence of a common bile duct obstruction such as stone.",
    "adverse_effects": "Unconjugated bilirubin tends to cross the blood-brain barrier, and because it is lipid-soluble, it can penetrate neuronal and glial membranes and may lead to a spectrum of diseases called biliary encephalopathy. Morbidity and mortality associated with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and bilirubinuria results from the underlying disease process."
