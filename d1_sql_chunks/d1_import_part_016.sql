Alprazolam may also be prescribed off-label for insomnia, premenstrual syndrome, and depression.[A177973]', 'Neurotransmission relies on excitatory and inhibitory signalling. γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type-A receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) are members of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (PLGIC) superfamily located synaptically and perisynaptically to mediate phasic inhibition and extrasynaptically to mediate tonic inhibition. GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs comprise a variety of subunits from a homologous family whose members are named based on sequence identity as one of α1-6, β1-3, γ1-3, δ, ε, θ, π, and ρ1-3. Each subunit possesses an extracellular (ECD), transmembrane (TMD), and intracellular (ICD) domain; inter-subunit interfaces are the primary points of neurotransmitter and modulator binding, described by coordination of the principal (+) and complementary (-) sites in each subunit. Binding of GABA to GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs induces pore opening, rapid flow of chloride ions, and synaptic hyperpolarization, which in turn manifests as an inhibitory signal.[A236793, A236798]



The most prevalent GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs _in vivo_ are the α1β2γ2 receptors, which contain both GABA (β+/α-) and benzodiazepine (BZD, α+/γ-) binding sites in the intersubunit interfaces of the relevant subunits.[A236793, A236798, A236828] In general, any receptors containing an α<sub>x</sub>/γ<sub>z</sub> interface, where x = 1-3,5 and z = 1-3, have potential high-affinity BZD binding sites, although small sequence differences between subunits may alter binding affinity to individual molecules. The α4 and α6 subunits, in which an otherwise conserved histidine is replaced by arginine, do not bind traditional BZD ligands such as diazepam and hence are considered "diazepam-insensitive".[A236793, A236798, A236828] GABA binding results in a series of conformational changes in the ECDs of GABA<sub>A</sub>R β subunits, "locking" each to its neighbouring α- interface. The binding of alprazolam in the high-affinity BZD site stabilizes the α+/γ- interface and facilitates the conformational changes that lead to pore opening, hence functioning as a positive allosteric modulator.[A236833]



The exact manner in which GABA<sub>A</sub>R allosteric modulation mediates the therapeutic and unwanted effects of benzodiazepines remains unclear.[A177973, A18125] Earlier studies suggested that the primary factor was the α subunit composition, with α1-containing receptors mediating the sedative effects, α2/3-containing receptors the anxiolytic effects, and α5-containing receptors the memory effects of benzodiazepines.[A236838] More recent studies suggest a more complex set of factors including subunit composition, physiological location, neuronal circuit, and nerve cell type.[A236843] To further complicate matters, there may be up to five distinct BZD binding sites on GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, with site 1 corresponding to the classical high-affinity α+/γ- interface. The effects of binding at sites 2-4 are not fully understood and likely impart greater complexity to benzodiazepine pharmacological action.[A236798, A236828]', 'Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine that binds γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type-A receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) to enhance their inhibitory effect on neurotransmission, specifically in the brain.[L34783, L34788] Concomitant use with opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death; patients taking benzodiazepines and opioids concurrently may require lower doses of one or both medications, depending on their clinical situation. Patients with pre-existing impaired respiratory function are at increased risk of adverse effects including death during treatment with benzodiazepines. In addition, due to its CNS depressant effects, patients taking alprazolam should avoid operating heavy machinery or driving and should avoid other CNS depressants such as alcohol. As with other benzodiazepines, alprazolam carries a risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which is higher in predisposed individuals and may require strict monitoring. Cessation of therapy may result in acute or protracted withdrawal symptoms, which may be life-threatening; the patient dose should be gradually tapered whenever discontinuation or reduced dosage are necessary. Newborns born to mothers using alprazolam later in pregnancy may suffer from sedation and withdrawal symptoms. As CYP3A is required for the initial step in alprazolam metabolism, alprazolam is contraindicated in patients taking strong CYP3A inhibitors, such as ketoconazole and itraconazole; milder CYP3A inhibitors still necessitate alprazolam dosage adjustments. Lastly, benzodiazepines may have negative effects, such as panic disorders, increased suicide incidence, and episodes of mania/hypomania, in patients suffering from depression.[A18125, A236788, L34783, L34788]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy are associated with the release of serotonin (5-HT) from enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine, presumably initiating a vomiting reflex through stimulation of 5-HT3 receptors located on vagal afferents [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Ondansetron may block the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a central release of serotonin from the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Thus, the antiemetic effect of ondansetron is probably due to the selective antagonism of 5-HT3 receptors on neurons located in either the peripheral or central nervous systems, or both [F3178, F3181, F3184].



Although the mechanisms of action of ondansetron in treating postoperative nausea and vomiting and cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting may share similar pathways, the role of ondansetron in opiate-induced emesis has not yet been formally established [F3181, F3184].', 'Ondansetron is a highly specific and selective serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist, not shown to have activity at other known serotonin receptors and with low affinity for dopamine receptors [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161]. The serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery, and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161]. The temporal relationship between the emetogenic action of emetogenic drugs and the release of serotonin, as well as the efficacy of antiemetic agents, suggest that chemotherapeutic agents release serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine by causing degenerative changes in the GI tract [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161]. The serotonin then stimulates the vagal and splanchnic nerve receptors that project to the medullary vomiting center, as well as the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors in the area postrema, thus initiating the vomiting reflex, causing nausea and vomiting [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161].



Moreover, the effect of ondansetron on the QTc interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo and positive (moxifloxacin) controlled, crossover study in 58 healthy adult men and women [F3181, F3184]. Ondansetron was tested at single doses of 8 mg and 32 mg infused intravenously over 15 minutes [F3181, F3184]. At the highest tested dose of 32 mg, prolongation of the Fridericia-corrected QTc interval (QT/RR0.33=QTcF) was observed from 15 min to 4 h after the start of the 15 min infusion, with a maximum mean (upper limit of 90% CI) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline-correction of 19.6 (21.5) msec at 20 min [F3181, F3184]. At the lower tested dose of 8 mg, QTc prolongation was observed from 15 min to 1 h after the start of the 15-minute infusion, with a maximum mean (upper limit of 90% CI) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline-correction of 5.8 (7.8) msec at 15 min [F3181, F3184]. The magnitude of QTc prolongation with ondansetron is expected to be greater if the infusion rate is faster than 15 minutes [F3181, F3184]. The 32 mg intravenous dose of ondansetron must not be administered [F3181, F3184]. No treatment-related effects on the QRS duration or the PR interval were observed at either the 8 or 32 mg dose [F3181, F3184].



An ECG assessment study has not been performed for orally administered ondansetron [F3181, F3184]. On the basis of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling, an 8 mg oral dose of ondansetron is predicted to cause a mean QTcF increase of 0.7 ms (90% CI -2.1, 3.3) at steady-state, assuming a mean maximal plasma concentration of 24.7 ng/mL (95% CI 21.1, 29.0) [F3181, F3184]. The magnitude of QTc prolongation at the recommended 5 mg/m2 dose in pediatrics has not been studied, but pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling predicts a mean increase of 6.6 ms (90% CI 2.8, 10.7) at maximal plasma concentrations [F3181, F3184]. 



In healthy subjects, single intravenous doses of 0.15 mg/kg of ondansetron had no effect on esophageal motility, gastric motility, lower esophageal sphincter pressure, or small intestinal transit time [F3178].

PGE<sub>2</sub> is the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.[A179023] It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.[T116,A179023] PGE<sub>2</sub> activates the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled EP<sub>1</sub> receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE<sub>2</sub> also activates the EP<sub>4</sub> receptor, coupled to G<sub>s</sub>, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE<sub>2</sub> act via EP<sub>3</sub> to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP<sub>2</sub> to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI<sub>2</sub> is known to play a role via its G<sub>s</sub>-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.



PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP<sub>2</sub> receptors.[T116,A179044] Similarly to β adrenergic receptors these are G<sub>s</sub>-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE<sub>2</sub> also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.[T116] PGD<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP<sub>1</sub> receptor.[A179044] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.



PGE<sub>2</sub> can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory G<sub>q</sub> EP<sub>3</sub> receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.[T116] This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever. NSAIDs prevent the generation of PGE<sub>2</sub> thereby reducing the activity of these neurons.

CA-II is a key isoenzyme found primarily in red blood cells (RBCs) that regulates aqueous humour production.[A1304] Dorzolamide is a highly specific CA-II inhibitor, where it displays a 4000-fold higher affinity for carbonic anhydrase II than carbonic anhydrase I.[A1304] The inhibition of CA-II in the ciliary process disrupts the formation of bicarbonate ions and reduces sodium and fluid transport, which leads to decreased aqueous humour secretion and reduced intraocular pressure.[A1304,L11377]', 'Dorzolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that reduces elevated intraocular pressure in open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. When used in combination with topic beta-adrenergic antagonists, dorzolamide has an additive effect of lowering intraocular pressure. The peak ocular hypotensive effect of dorzolamide is observed at about 2 hours following ophthalmic administration.[A1304]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

PGE<sub>2</sub> is the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.[A179023] It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.[T116,A179023] PGE<sub>2</sub> activates the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled EP<sub>1</sub> receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE<sub>2</sub> also activates the EP<sub>4</sub> receptor, coupled to G<sub>s</sub>, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE<sub>2</sub> act via EP<sub>3</sub> to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP<sub>2</sub> to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI<sub>2</sub> is known to play a role via its G<sub>s</sub>-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.



PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP<sub>2</sub> receptors.[T116,A179044] Similarly to β adrenergic receptors these are G<sub>s</sub>-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE<sub>2</sub> also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.[T116] PGD<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP<sub>1</sub> receptor.[A179044] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.



PGE<sub>2</sub> can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory G<sub>q</sub> EP<sub>3</sub> receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.[T116] This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever. NSAIDs prevent the generation of PGE<sub>2</sub> thereby reducing the activity of these neurons.

Hyperuricemia is closely related to gout, whereby it may exist for many years before the first clinical attack of gout; thus, aberrated serum uric acid levels and hyperuricemia are believed to be the biochemical aberration involved in the pathogenesis of gout.[A230548] Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) can act as a xanthine oxidase or xanthine dehydrogenase. In humans, it is a critical enzyme for uric acid production as it catalyzes the oxidation reaction steps from hypoxanthine to xanthine and from xanthine to uric acid in the pathway of purine metabolism.[A19658] Febuxostat potently inhibits XOR, blocking both its oxidase and dehydrogenase activities. With high affinity, febuxostat binds to XOR in a molecular channel leading to the molybdenum-pterin active site, where [allopurinol] demonstrates relatively weak competitive inhibition.[A230548] 



XOR is mainly found in the dehydrogenase form under normal physiological conditions; however, in inflammatory conditions, XOR can be converted into the xanthine oxidase form, which catalyzes reactions that produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as peroxynitrite. ROS contribute to vascular inflammation and alterations in vascular function. As febuxostat can inhibit both forms of XOR, it can inhibit ROS formation, oxidative stress, and inflammation.[A2743] In a rat model, febuxostat suppressed renal ischemia-reperfusion injury by attenuating oxidative stress.[A2744]', 'Febuxostat is a novel, selective xanthine oxidase/dehydrogenase inhibitor that works by decreasing serum uric acid in a dose-dependent manner.

Following irradiation, aloe polysaccharides block the upregulation of pro-apoptotic p53, Bax, and Bad while blocking downregulating anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 [A32473]. _In vivo_, aloe polysaccharides may act as a scavenger for oxygen free radicals including DPPH, alkyl radicals, superoxides, and singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals that may also be generated by superoxides [A32470, A32476]. Hydrogen peroxide, which is a weak initiate lipid peroxidation, may also be effectively scavenged by aloe polysaccharides [A32476]. In a Fenton reaction system, aloe polysaccharides demonstrated a concentration-dependent scavenging activity against hydroxyl radical that were generated during the reaction [A32476]. Aloe polysaccharides may also compete with oxygen to react with nitric oxide (NO), thereby inhibiting the generation of nitrite and peroxynitrite anions that act as free radicals [A32476]. 



Findings from a study investigating the effects of aloe polysaccharides on doxorubicin-induced oxidative stress suggest that aloe polysaccharides mediate potent antioxidant actions _in vivo_ [A32476]. Doxorubicin, known to generate reactive oxygen species such as superoxide and hydroxy radicals, was administered to albino rats. This led to myocardial oxidative stress and cardiac injury accompanied by leakage of LDH and CPK from cardiac myocytes and to serum due to lipid peroxidation of cardiac membranes, reduced levels of antioxidant coenzyme GSH, and increased levels of SOD from a compensatory and combative mechanism of oxidative stress [A32476]. Treatment with aloe polysaccharides resulted in a significant decrease in serum LDH and CPK levels, indicating that aloe polysaccharides are capable in stabilizing cardiac membranes from peroxidative damage. Restored levels of endogenous GSH and SOD in a dose-dependent manner were also observed with the treatment of aloe polysaccharides, suggesting that aloe polysaccharides exhibit potent antioxidant properties [A32476].



In a study of rats with open cutaneous back wounds, treatment with aloe polysaccharides decreased the levels of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) and induced tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) during the early stage of wound repair, resulting in decreased collagen breakdown and increased preservation of collagen content in the injured area [A32471].

Studies suggest that aloe polysaccharides may evidently attenuate tumor growth in mice [A32473].

Abrocitinib is not recommended for use in combination with other JAK inhibitors, biologic immunomodulators, or other immunosuppressants.[L39769]', 'Janus kinases (JAKs) are a family consisting of four receptor-associated kinases - JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2). Upon ligand binding and subsequent dimerization of cytokine and hormone receptors, receptor-associated JAKs are activated and phosphorylated. This allows the binding of Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs), which are transcription factors. STAT binds to the receptor, and JAK phosphorylates and activates STAT to create a STAT dimer. The STAT dimer translocates to the nucleus to upregulate the gene transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors implicated in atopic dermatitis.[A183188,A244549] Blocking the JAK-STAT pathway is advantageous, as it is an intracellular signalling pathway where many pro-inflammatory pathways converge.[A244554]



Each JAK plays a role in the signalling and regulation of different cytokines and immune cells. In atopic dermatitis, JAK1 is the therapeutic target of focus as it is involved in the signalling of the γc family of cytokines involved in immune responses and disease pathophysiology, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15.[A244549] Abrocitinib reversibly inhibits JAK1 by blocking the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site. Biochemical assays demonstrate that abrocitinib is selective for JAK1 over JAK2 (28-fold), JAK3 (>340-fold), and tyrosine kinase (TYK) 2 (43-fold), as well as the broader kinome.[L39769] Similarly, in cellular settings, abrocitinib preferentially inhibited cytokine-induced STAT phosphorylation by signalling pairs involving JAK1, while sparing signalling by JAK2/JAK2, or JAK2/TYK2 pairs.[L39774] The relevance of inhibition of specific JAK enzymes to the drug''s therapeutic effectiveness is currently unknown.[L39769]', 'Abrocitinib mediates anti-inflammatory effects by blocking the signalling of pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in atopic dermatitis.[A244554] It dose-dependently reduces the serum markers of inflammation in atopic dermatitis, including high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin-31 (IL-31), and thymus and activation regulated chemokine (TARC).

Contraction of the ciliary muscle via M<sub>3</sub> receptor signalling also leads to accommodation, adjusting the lens for near vision.[A230178] The eye is also innervated by parasympathetic nerves: ciliary ganglion neurons project to the ciliary body and the sphincter pupillae muscle of the iris to control ocular accommodation and pupil constriction.[A230183]

The cycloplegic effect occurs within 20 to minutes following administration, with a duration of action of four to 10 hours. Tropicamide can elevate intraocular pressure.[A229958] The ophthalmic use of tropicamide is not typically associated with serious systemic adverse events.[A230173]



One randomized pilot study showed that oral tropicamide alleviated perceived symptoms of sialorrhea in patients with Parkinson''s Disease: anticholinergics are believed to restore the dopaminergic to cholinergic activity imbalance in neurodegenerative diseases.[A229958] Similarly in one case report, tropicamide administered via ophthalmic solution relieved clozapine-induced sialorrhea.[A230093] Interestingly, in rodent models, tropicamide suppressed drug-induced tremulous jaw movements which are often used as a model of parkinsonian tremor: the significance of this finding requires further investigations.[A5677]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

', 'Two key active ingredients in _ginkgo biloba_ are terpene lactones (notably ginkgolides and diterpenes) and ginkgo flavone glycosides (notably ginkgetin, bilobetin, and sciadopitysin), which are present at varying concentrations. _Ginkgo biloba_ extract EGb 761 is the standardized extract of _ginkgo biloba_ used in studies, which contains 6% terpenoids and 24% flavonoid glycosides. Animal studies have shown that _ginkgo biloba_ works on several neurotransmitter pathways and brain structures. Flavones were shown to inhibit lipid peroxidation; inhibit the uptake of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine; and inhibit platelet aggregation.[A232404] Terpene lactones may also act as potent antagonists of the platelet-activating factor and may possess anti-ischemic and fibrinolytic effects.[A232379] They were also shown to downregulate adrenal peripheral benzodiazepine receptors and increase adrenocorticotropic hormone levels.[A232404] _Ginkgo biloba_ also reversibly inhibits monoamine oxidase A; and modestly inhibits anticholinesterase activity,[A232379, A232389] leading to enhanced cholinergic transmission in the brain.[A232394] 



Several studies suggest that _ginkgo biloba_ exerts neuroprotective effects by reducing free radical production in the prefrontal cortex, which may explain its improvement on short-term memory. _Ginkgo biloba_ extract acts as a free radical scavenger, protecting neurons from oxidative damage and apoptosis related to aging, cerebral ischemia, and neurodegenerative disorders.[A232379] _Ginkgo biloba_ also inhibits amyloid-β neurotoxicity and protects against hypoxic challenges and increased oxidative stress.[A232389] One study showed that bilobalide, a terpene lactone, delays the onset of hypoxic glycolysis.[A232404] _Ginkgo biloba_ has the potential to regulate metabolism, stabilize the membrane, and promote vasodilation. In the arterial endothelium, EGb stimulated the release of endogenous relaxing factors, such as endothelium-derived relaxing factor and prostacyclin. In the inflammatory environment that causes tissue damage, EGb promoted nitric oxide production, leading to enhanced peripheral and cerebral blood flow.[A232379] ', '_Ginkgo biloba_ is a herbal ingredient with demonstrated antioxidant, vasoactive, antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, antiplatelet, and fibrinolytic properties.[A232389, A232399] _Ginkgo biloba_ has been investigated for use in a variety of medical conditions, but the most extensively studied area is in the context of cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative disorders. _Ginkgo biloba_ was examined as a potential nootropic agent or cognitive enhancer but research findings supporting the therapeutic efficacy of _ginkgo biloba_ extract (EGb) in dementia remain controversial. Some clinical studies of dementia that were up to one year long showed that EGb improves the cognitive performance and social functioning of patients. However, other studies did not support its clinical benefit for patients with cognitive impairment and dementia. Numerous meta-analysis studies showed insufficient evidence of the effectiveness of EGb in reducing both all-cause dementia incidence and Alzheimer''s disease-associated dementia incidence in elderly patients with normal cognition or with mild cognitive impairment. Additionally, there is no up-to-date evidence that demonstrates the benefit of the long-term use of standardized EGb in reducing the risk of progression to Alzheimer''s disease. A 2012 meta-analysis did not support the use of EGb in enhancing cognitive function in healthy adults.[A232379]



In the context of cardiovascular diseases, a limited number of studies showed that EGb improved mortality or neurological recovery in the post-stroke period, reduced cognitive and neurological impairment after acute ischemic stroke, and improved blood flow in the coronary artery in patients with coronary artery disease. However, a systemic review found no statistical or clinically significant benefit of EGb for patients with peripheral arterial disease or hypertension. Overall, there is a lack of strong evidence in the use of EGb for the treatment or prevention of cardiovascular diseases.[A232379]



In a small trial, the use of EGb as an adjunctive treatment with citalopram improved depressive symptoms and cognitive function in patients with depression.[A232379] _Ginkgo biloba_ was also investigated as a potential treatment for antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction.[A2434] Another study showed EGb improving the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia. There is insufficient evidence to prove the effectiveness of EGb in these psychiatric disorders. Limited studies have investigated the role of _ginkgo biloba_ in the treatment of vertigo, tinnitus, vitiligo, macular degeneration, and glaucoma, as well as the prevention of acute mountain sickness.

As a single agent, ipratropium was indicated for the symptomatic relief of rhinorrhea associated with the common cold or seasonal allergic rhinitis for patients 5 years or older. It does not alleviate nasal congestion nor sneezing.[FDA label]



Rhinorrhea refers to recurrent or chronic watery nasal discharge. This condition is debilitating and its pathogenesis and etiology is complex and not very well understood presenting very substantial cost burden.[L5903]



Additionally, ipratropium is indicated as a bronchodilator for maintenance treatment of bronchospasm associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.[FDA label]



The chronic obstructive pulmonary disease includes a large number of conditions characterized by breathlessness. As this includes several conditions, the etiology, symptoms, and treatments are diverse.[L5906]



Ipratropium has also been studied to be used for the treatment of sialorrhea.[A176942]



Sialorrhea is a common symptom that accompanies different neurologic conditions and it is characterized by drooling or excessive salivation.[A176963]', 'Ipratropium acts as an antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor.[A176939] This effect produces the inhibition of the parasympathetic nervous system in the airways and hence, inhibit their function. The function of the parasympathetic system in the airway is to generate bronchial secretions and constriction and hence, the inhibition of this action can lead to bronchodilation and fewer secretions.[A176945]



At the cellular level, the diameter of the airways is controlled by the release of acetylcholine into the muscle cells causing them to contract and producing a narrow airway. Thus administration of ipratropium stops the activity of acetylcholine in the smooth muscle preventing the contraction and producing relaxed airways.[T457]', 'Ipratropium is a short-acting agent that inhibits the parasympathetic nervous system at the level of the airway which then produces bronchodilatation. The effect of this agent starts after 1-2 hours and it is known to last only from 4 to 6 hours.[A176945] As part of the effect, ipratropium relaxes the bronchial airways which reverse the narrowing that accounts for wheezy breathing, chest tightness, cough and abnormal gas exchange.[T457]



In clinical trials where ipratropium was used in the initial management of status asthmaticus, it was demonstrated a clear benefit in pulmonary function in children and adults. However, the continuous use of ipratropium after an acute asthmatic attack is not proven to be significantly advantageous[A176939] nor the prophylactic administration of this agent.[T542]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

i) ondansetron was effective and well tolerated when given to children 4-12 years of age for the treatment of post-chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting,

ii) ondansetron tablets, ondansetron ODT, ondansetron injection are not indicated for the treatment of children 3 years of age or younger,

iii) ondansetron tablets, ondansetron ODT, ondansetron injection are not indicated for use in any age group of the pediatric population for the treatment of post-radiotherapy induced nausea and vomiting, and

iV) ondansetron tablets, ondansetron ODT, ondansetron injection are not indicated for use in any age group of the pediatric population for the treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting



In the geriatric (>65 years of age) patient population:

i) efficacy and tolerance of ondansetron were similar to that observed in younger adults for the treatment of post-chemotherapy and radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and

ii) clinical experience in the use of ondansetron in the prevention and treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting is limited and is not indicated for use in the geriatric patient population ', 'Ondansetron is a selective antagonist of the serotonin receptor subtype, 5-HT3 [F3178, F3181, F3184].



Cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy are associated with the release of serotonin (5-HT) from enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine, presumably initiating a vomiting reflex through stimulation of 5-HT3 receptors located on vagal afferents [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Ondansetron may block the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a central release of serotonin from the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Thus, the antiemetic effect of ondansetron is probably due to the selective antagonism of 5-HT3 receptors on neurons located in either the peripheral or central nervous systems, or both [F3178, F3181, F3184].



Although the mechanisms of action of ondansetron in treating postoperative nausea and vomiting and cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting may share similar pathways, the role of ondansetron in opiate-induced emesis has not yet been formally established [F3181, F3184].', 'Ondansetron is a highly specific and selective serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist, not shown to have activity at other known serotonin receptors and with low affinity for dopamine receptors [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161]. The serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery, and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161]. The temporal relationship between the emetogenic action of emetogenic drugs and the release of serotonin, as well as the efficacy of antiemetic agents, suggest that chemotherapeutic agents release serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine by causing degenerative changes in the GI tract [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161]. The serotonin then stimulates the vagal and splanchnic nerve receptors that project to the medullary vomiting center, as well as the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors in the area postrema, thus initiating the vomiting reflex, causing nausea and vomiting [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161].



Moreover, the effect of ondansetron on the QTc interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo and positive (moxifloxacin) controlled, crossover study in 58 healthy adult men and women [F3181, F3184]. Ondansetron was tested at single doses of 8 mg and 32 mg infused intravenously over 15 minutes [F3181, F3184]. At the highest tested dose of 32 mg, prolongation of the Fridericia-corrected QTc interval (QT/RR0.33=QTcF) was observed from 15 min to 4 h after the start of the 15 min infusion, with a maximum mean (upper limit of 90% CI) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline-correction of 19.6 (21.5) msec at 20 min [F3181, F3184]. At the lower tested dose of 8 mg, QTc prolongation was observed from 15 min to 1 h after the start of the 15-minute infusion, with a maximum mean (upper limit of 90% CI) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline-correction of 5.8 (7.8) msec at 15 min [F3181, F3184]. The magnitude of QTc prolongation with ondansetron is expected to be greater if the infusion rate is faster than 15 minutes [F3181, F3184]. The 32 mg intravenous dose of ondansetron must not be administered [F3181, F3184]. No treatment-related effects on the QRS duration or the PR interval were observed at either the 8 or 32 mg dose [F3181, F3184].



An ECG assessment study has not been performed for orally administered ondansetron [F3181, F3184]. On the basis of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling, an 8 mg oral dose of ondansetron is predicted to cause a mean QTcF increase of 0.7 ms (90% CI -2.1, 3.3) at steady-state, assuming a mean maximal plasma concentration of 24.7 ng/mL (95% CI 21.1, 29.0) [F3181, F3184]. The magnitude of QTc prolongation at the recommended 5 mg/m2 dose in pediatrics has not been studied, but pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling predicts a mean increase of 6.6 ms (90% CI 2.8, 10.7) at maximal plasma concentrations [F3181, F3184]. 



In healthy subjects, single intravenous doses of 0.15 mg/kg of ondansetron had no effect on esophageal motility, gastric motility, lower esophageal sphincter pressure, or small intestinal transit time [F3178]. Multiday administration of ondansetron has been shown to slow colonic transit in healthy subjects [F3178]. Ondansetron has no effect on plasma prolactin concentrations [F3178].', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Tobramycin applied topically to the eyes is indicated for the treatment of external eye (and adjoining structure) infections by susceptible bacteria.[L32744] 



Tobramycin injection is indicated in adult and pediatric patients for the treatment of serious bacterial infections, including septicemia (caused by _P. aeruginosa_, _Escherichia coli_, and _Klebsiella_ spp.), lower respiratory tract infections (caused by _P. aeruginosa_, _Klebsiella_ spp., _Enterobacter_ spp., _Serratia_ spp., _E. coli_, and _Staphylococcus aureus_, both penicillinase and non-penicillinase-producing strains), serious central-nervous-system infections (meningitis, caused by susceptible organisms), intra-abdominal infections including peritonitis (caused by _E. coli_, _Klebsiella_ spp., and _Enterobacter_ spp.), skin, bone, and skin structure infections (caused by _P. aeruginosa_, _Proteus_ spp., _E. coli_, _Klebsiella_ spp., _Enterobacter_ spp., _Serratia_ spp. and _S. aureus_), and complicated and recurrent urinary tract infections (caused by _P. aeruginosa_, _Proteus_ spp., _E. coli_, _Klebsiella_ spp., _Enterobacter_ spp., _Serratia_ spp., _S. aureus_, _Providencia_ spp., and _Citrobacter_ spp.).[L32749] Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, should generally not be used in uncomplicated urinary tract infections or staphylococcal infections unless less toxic antibiotics cannot be used and the bacteria in question are known to be sensitive to aminoglycosides.[L32749,L45359]



As with all antibiotics, tobramycin use should be limited to cases where bacterial infections are known or strongly suspected to be caused by sensitive organisms, and the possible emergence of resistance should be monitored closely.[L32739,L32744,L32749]', 'Tobramycin is a 4,6-disubstituted 2-deoxystreptamine (DOS) ring-containing aminoglycoside antibiotic with activity against various Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria.[L32739, L32744, L32749] The mechanism of action of tobramycin has not been unambiguously elucidated, and some insights into its mechanism rely on results using similar aminoglycosides. In general, like other aminoglycosides, tobramycin is bactericidal and exhibits both immediate and delayed killing, which are attributed to different mechanisms, as outlined below.[A232294, A232299]



Aminoglycosides are polycationic at physiological pH, such that they readily bind to bacterial membranes ("ionic binding"); this includes binding to lipopolysaccharide and phospholipids within the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and to teichoic acid and phospholipids within the cell membrane of Gram-positive bacteria. This binding displaces divalent cations and increases membrane permeability, which allows aminoglycoside entry.[A232294, A232304, A232309, A232314] Additional aminoglycoside entry ("energy-dependent phase I") into the cytoplasm requires the proton-motive force, allowing access of the aminoglycoside to its primary intracellular target of the bacterial 30S ribosome.[A232294, A232314] Mistranslated proteins produced as a result of aminoglycoside binding to the ribosome (see below) integrate into and disrupt the cell membrane, which allows more of the aminoglycoside into the cell ("energy-dependent phase II").[A232294, A232314, A232319] Hence, tobramycin and other aminoglycosides have both immediate bactericidal effects through membrane disruption and delayed bactericidal effects through impaired protein synthesis; observed experimental data and mathematical modelling support this two-mechanism model.[A232294, A232299]



Inhibition of protein synthesis was the first recognized effect of aminoglycoside antibiotics. Structural and cell biological studies suggest that aminoglycosides bind to the 16S rRNA in helix 44 (h44), near the A site of the 30S ribosomal subunit, altering interactions between h44 and h45. This binding also displaces two important residues, A1492 and A1493, from h44, mimicking normal conformational changes that occur with successful codon-anticodon pairing in the A site.[A232324, A232329] Overall, aminoglycoside binding has several negative effects, including inhibiting translation initiation and elongation and ribosome recycling.[A232294, A232334, A232339] Recent evidence suggests that the latter effect is due to a cryptic second binding site situated in h69 of the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit.[A232329, A232339] Also, by stabilizing a conformation that mimics correct codon-anticodon pairing, aminoglycosides promote error-prone translation;[A232344] mistranslated proteins can incorporate into the cell membrane, inducing the damage discussed above.[A232294, A232319]



Although direct mutation of the 16S rRNA is a rare resistance mechanism, due to the gene being present in numerous copies, posttranscriptional 16S rRNA modification by 16S rRNA methyltransferases (16S-RMTases) at the N7 position of G1405 or the N1 position of A1408 are common resistance mechanisms in aminoglycoside-resistant bacteria.[A232294, A232349] These mutants also further support the proposed mechanism of action of aminoglycosides. Direct modification of the aminoglycoside itself through acetylation, adenylation, and phosphorylation by aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (AMEs) are also commonly encountered resistance mutations.[A232294, A232349] Finally, due to the requirement for active transport of aminoglycosides across bacterial membranes, they are not active against obligately anaerobic bacteria.[A232294]', 'Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic derived from the actinomycete _Streptomyces tenebrarius_.[L32749] It has a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-negative bacteria, including _Enterobacteriaceae_, _Escherichia coli_, _Klebsiella pneumoniae_, _Morganella morganii_, _Moraxella lacunata_, _Proteus_ spp., _Haemophilus_ spp., _Acinetobacter_ spp., _Neisseria_ spp., and, importantly, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_. Aminoglycosides also generally retain activity against the biothreat agents _Yersinia pestis_ and _Francisella tularensis_. In addition, aminoglycosides are active against some Gram-positive bacteria such as _Staphylococcus_ spp., including methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant strains, _Streptococcus_ spp., and _Mycobacterium_ spp.[A232294, L32744]



Like other aminoglycosides, tobramycin is taken up and retained by proximal tubule and cochlear cells in the kidney and ear, respectively, and hence carries a risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity.[A232294, L32749] There is also a risk of neuromuscular block, which may be more pronounced in patients with preexisting neuromuscular disorders such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson''s disease.[A232294, L32739, L32749] Aminoglycosides can cross the placenta, resulting in total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in babies born to mothers who were administered an aminoglycoside during pregnancy.[L32739, L32749] Due to the low systemic absorption of inhaled and topical tobramycin formulations, these effects are more pronounced with injected tobramycin than with other formulations.[L32739, L32744, L32749] However, all formulations carry a risk of hypersensitivity reactions, including potentially fatal cutaneous reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.[L32739, L32744, L32749]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

[T116] ', 'Ramipril inhibits the RAAS system by binding to and inhibiting ACE thereby preventing the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. [T116] As plasma levels of angiotensin II fall, less activation of the G-protein coupled receptors angiotensin receptor I (AT<sub>1</sub>R) and angiotensin receptor II (AT<sub>2</sub>R) occurs. 



AT<sub>1</sub>R mediates vasoconstriction, inflammation, fibrosis, and oxidative stress through a variety of signaling pathways. [T116] These include G<sub>q</sub> coupling to the inositol triphosphate pathway, activation of phospholipases C, A<sub>2</sub>, and D which contribute to eicosanoid production, activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and MAP kinases, G<sub>i</sub> and G<sub>12/13</sub>, and eventual activation of the Jak/STAT pathway leading to cell growth and production of extracellular matrix components. AT<sub>1</sub>R activation also leads to increased activity of membrane-bound NADH/NADPH oxidase which contributes to production of reactive oxygen species. Decreased activation of this receptor mediates the renoprotective, antihypertensive, and cardioprotective effects of ramipril by reducing inflammation and vasoconstriction.



AT<sub>2</sub>R acts in opposition to the effects of AT<sub>1</sub>R by activating phosphotyrosine phosphatases which inhibit MAP kinases, inhibiting Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel opening, and stimulating cGMP and nitric oxide production leading to vasodilation. [T116] These counteracting effects are shared by the Mas receptor which is activated by Ang(1-7), a subtype of angiotensin produced by plasma esterases from AngI or by ACE2 from AngII produced through a secondary pathway by tonin and cathepsin G. Ang(1-7) also activates AT<sub>2</sub>R although the bulk of its effect is mediated by MasR.



ACE is also responsible for the breakdown of bradykinin. [T116] The resulting buildup of bradykinin due to ACE inhibition is thought to mediate the characteristic dry-cough as a side effect of ACE inhibitor medications.



', 'Ramipril is an ACE inhibitor similar to benazepril, fosinopril and quinapril. [T116] It is an inactive prodrug that is converted to ramiprilat in the liver, the main site of activation, and kidneys. Ramiprilat confers blood pressure lowing effects by antagonizing the effect of the RAAS. The RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from the granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. In the blood stream, renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to ATI, which is subsequently cleaved to ATII by ACE. ATII increases blood pressure using a number of mechanisms. First, it stimulates the secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone travels to the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and collecting tubule of nephrons where it increases sodium and water reabsorption by increasing the number of sodium channels and sodium-potassium ATPases on cell membranes. Second, ATII stimulates the secretion of vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone or ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland. ADH stimulates further water reabsorption from the kidneys via insertion of aquaporin-2 channels on the apical surface of cells of the DCT and collecting tubules. Third, ATII increases blood pressure through direct arterial vasoconstriction. Stimulation of the Type 1 ATII receptor on vascular smooth muscle cells leads to a cascade of events resulting in myocyte contraction and vasoconstriction. In addition to these major effects, ATII induces the thirst response via stimulation of hypothalamic neurons. ACE inhibitors inhibit the rapid conversion of ATI to ATII and antagonize RAAS-induced increases in blood pressure. ACE (also known as kininase II) is also involved in the enzymatic deactivation of bradykinin, a vasodilator. Inhibiting the deactivation of bradykinin increases bradykinin levels and may sustain the effects of ramiprilat by causing increased vasodilation and decreased blood pressure.', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Moxifloxacin can be used to treat infections caused by the following bacteria: Aerobic Gram-positive microorganisms: _Corynebacterium_ species, _Micrococcus luteus_, _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Staphylococcus epidermidis_, _Staphylococcus haemolyticus_, _Staphylococcus hominis_, _Staphylococcus warneri_, _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, and _Streptococcus viridans_ group. Aerobic Gram-negative microorganisms: _Acinetobacter lwoffii_, _Haemophilus influenzae_, and _Haemophilus parainfluenzae_. Other microorganisms: _Chlamydia trachomatis_. Moxifloxacin is bactericidal and its mode of action depends on blocking of bacterial DNA replication by binding itself to an enzyme called DNA gyrase, which allows the untwisting required to replicate one DNA double helix into two. Notably the drug has 100 times higher affinity for bacterial DNA gyrase than for mammalian.

', 'IVIg interacts with a number of different components of the immune system, including cytokines, complement, Fc receptors and several cell surface immunocompetent molecules. IVIg also impacts different effector cells of the immune system (B and T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, etc.) and regulates a wide range of genes. Its main mechanism of actions are believed to be Fc-dependent and F(ab'')2-dependent. IVIg competitively blocks gamma Fc receptors, preventing the binding and ingestion of phagocytes and suppressing platelet depletion. IVIg contains a number of different antobodies, which prevent infection by attaching to the surface of invading pathogens and aiding in their disposal before they can infect cells. Antibodies remove pathogens via complement activation, agglutination or precipitation, pathogen receptor blocking, macrophage “tagging” or neutralization (via binding) of pathogen toxins. Intact IVIg and F(ab′)2 fragments of IVIg can also neutralize the activity of various autoantibodies. By triggering the production of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, IVIg modulates of the production of cytokines and cytokine antagonists.

**A note on fungal infection prophylaxis**



Patients receiving bone marrow transplantation who are treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy may be predisposed to candida infections, and may receive fluconazole as prophylactic therapy.[L11043]



**A note on laboratory testing**



Obtaining specimens for fungal culture and other important laboratory studies such as serology or pathology is advised before starting fluconazole therapy in order to isolate the organisms to be eliminated through treatment. It is permissible to start therapy before the results are available, however, adjusting the therapy once laboratory results confirm the causative organism may be necessary.[L11043]

', 'Fluconazole is a very selective inhibitor of fungal cytochrome P450 dependent enzyme _lanosterol 14-α-demethylase_. This enzyme normally works to convert _lanosterol_ to _ergosterol_, which is necessary for fungal cell wall synthesis.  The free nitrogen atom located on the azole ring of fluconazole binds with a single iron atom located in the heme group of lanosterol 14-α-demethylase.[A178774] This prevents oxygen activation and, as a result, inhibits the demethylation of lanosterol, halting the process of ergosterol biosynthesis.[A178777]  Methylated sterols are then found to accumulate in the fungal cellular membrane, leading to an arrest of fungal growth.[A178774] These accumulated sterols negatively affect the structure and function of the fungal cell plasma membrane.[A16632]



Fluconazole resistance may arise from an alteration in the amount or function of the target enzyme (lanosterol 14-α-demethylase), altered access to this enzyme, or a combination of the above.[A16632] Other mechanisms may also be implicated, and studies are ongoing.[A178783]', 'Fluconazole has been demonstrated to show fungistatic activity against the majority of strains of the following microorganisms, curing fungal infections[L11043]:



_Candida albicans, Candida glabrata (Many strains are intermediately susceptible), Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, Cryptococcus neoformans_



This is achieved through steroidal inhibition in fungal cells, interfering with cell wall synthesis and growth as well as cell adhesion, thereby treating fungal infections and their symptoms.[L11043,A174325,A174343]



The fungistatic activity of fluconazole has also been shown in normal and immunocompromised animal models with both systemic and intracranial fungal infections caused by _Cryptococcus neoformans_ and for systemic infections caused by Candida albicans.[L11043]  It is important to note that resistant organisms have been found against various strains of organisms treated with fluconazole.[A178759,A178762,A178765] This further substantiates the need to perform susceptibility testing when fluconazole is considered as an antifungal therapy.[A178768,A178786] 





**A note on steroidal effects of fluconazole**



There has been some concern that fluconazole may interfere with and inactivate human steroids/hormones due to the inhibition of hepatic cytochrome enzymes.[L11034]  Fluconazole has demonstrated to be more selective for _fungal_ cytochrome P-450 enzymes than for a variety of mammalian cytochrome P-450 enzymes. Fluconazole 50 mg administered daily for up to 28 days in individuals of reproductive age has been show to have no effect on testosterone plasma concentrations of males and plasma concentrations of steroids in females.

Insulin binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor is able to autophosphorylate and phosphorylate numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1.

For adult patients who have not healed after 8 weeks of treatment, an additional 8-week course of pantoprazole may be considered. Safety of treatment beyond 8 weeks in pediatric patients has not been determined.[F3202]



**Maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis**



Indicated for maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis and reduction in relapse rates of daytime and nighttime heartburn symptoms in adult patients with GERD.[F3202]



**Pathological hypersecretory conditions including Zollinger-Ellison syndrome**



Indicated for the long-term treatment of the above conditions.[F3202]', 'Hydrochloric acid (HCl) secretion into the gastric lumen is a process regulated mainly by the H(+)/K(+)-ATPase of the proton pump, expressed in high quantities by the parietal cells of the stomach.[A174295] ATPase is an enzyme on the parietal cell membrane that facilitates hydrogen and potassium exchange through the cell, which normally results in the extrusion of potassium and formation of HCl (gastric acid). 



Proton pump inhibitors such as pantoprazole are substituted _benzimidazole_ derivatives, weak bases, which accumulate in the acidic space of the parietal cell before being converted in the _canaliculi_  (small canal) of the gastric parietal cell, an acidic environment, to active _sulfenamide_ derivatives. This active form then makes disulfide bonds with important cysteines on the gastric acid pump, inhibiting its function.[A174247] Specifically, pantoprazole binds to the _sulfhydryl group_ of H+, K+-ATPase, which is an enzyme implicated in accelerating the final step in the acid secretion pathway. The enzyme is inactivated, inhibiting gastric acid secretion.[A174253] The inhibition of gastric acid secretion is stronger with proton pump inhibitors such as pantoprazole and lasts longer than with the H(2) antagonists.[A174295] ', 'This drug acts to decrease gastric acid secretion, which reduces stomach acidity. Pantoprazole administration leads to long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion.[F3193]



**General Effects**



Pantoprazole has been shown to reduce acid reflux-related symptoms, heal inflammation of the esophagus, and improve patient quality of life more effectively than histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2 blockers). This drug has an excellent safety profile and a low incidence of drug interactions. It can be used safely in various high-risk patient populations, including the elderly and those with renal failure or moderate hepatic dysfunction.[A174226]



Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as pantoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]



PPIs such as pantoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes [A177577, A177580]. 



**A note on laboratory testing abnormalities**



During treatment with antisecretory medicinal products such as pantoprazole, serum gastrin (a peptide hormone that stimulates secretion of gastric acid) increases in response to the decreased acid secretion caused by proton pump inhibition. The increased gastrin level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Published evidence suggests that proton pump inhibitors should be stopped 14 days before chromogranin A (CgA) measurements. This permits chromogranin A levels, that might be falsely elevated after proton pump inhibitor treatment, to return to the normal reference range.[F3217] 



Reports have been made of false-positive results in urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving the majority of proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole. A confirmatory method should be used.[F3217]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

[L39095] Patients may experience ED due to a variety of causes including psychogenic, neurogenic, vasculogenic, iatrogenic, or endocrine. [A242392] These causes result in dysfunction of penile smooth muscle relaxation through either disrupted neuronal signaling or direct influence on smooth muscle cells. During sexual arousal, non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) neurons release nitric oxide (NO). Nitric oxide stimulates guanylate cyclase which converts guanosine triphosphate to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).[A242287, A242377] cGMP activates the cGMP-dependent kinase (PKG) in a signal cascade which activates K+ channels leading to inhibition of Ca2+ channels, inhibits platelet activation, and inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation while inducing apoptosis. This signal cascade is attenuated by PDE5 which breaks the phosphodiester bond of cGMP, converting it to GMP. Inhibition of PDE5 by tadalafil increases signaling via the PKG cascade which supports penile smooth muscle relaxation during sexual arousal by decreasing Ca2+ entry into smooth muscle cells. This smooth muscle relaxation allows blood to fill the corpus cavernosum thereby producing an erection.



In PAH, blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries is raised due to a variety of mechanisms stemming from endothelial dysfunction.[A242377] Decreased production of NO and prostacyclin reduce vasodilatory signaling while overproduction of endothelin-1 and thromboxane increase vasoconstriction. Inflammation, thromboses, and hypoxia later contribute to vascular remodeling which further reduces luminal size. The resultant increase in blood pressure reduces the capacity for gas exchange and increases afterload at the right ventricle, producing symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and dizziness as well as leading to right-sided heart failure. Tadalafil exerts its therapeutic effect in PAH through boosting NO-cGMP signaling to contribute to smooth muscle relaxation as with ED.



Lastly, tadalafil is used to treat BPH.[L39095] BPH produces urinary dysfunction through hyperproliferation of the epithelial and smooth muscle layers of the prostate.[A242382] The increased size of the prostate blocks urine flow through the urethra resulting in higher residual volumes due to incomplete emptying. Tadalafil does not appear to exert its benefit via smooth muscle relaxation of the prostate. It may instead exert its effect through a mix of increased oxygenation and decreased inflammation, which decreases tissue remodeling, and inhibition of cell proliferation through the cGMP cascade.



The decreased affinity for PDE6 compared to other PDE5 inhibitors may explain the decreased incidence of visual side effects as PDE6 is present in the eye and contributes to color vision.[L39100, L39105, A242287]', 'Tadalafil exerts a therapeutic effect in ED by increasing sexual stimulation-dependant smooth muscle relaxation in the penis, allowing the corpus cavernosum to fill with blood to produce an erection.[A242287, A242377] Smooth muscle relaxation in the pulmonary vasculature helps to produce vasodilation in PAH which reduces blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries.[A242377] In BPH, tadalafil may contribute to decreased smooth muscle cell proliferation which may reduce the size of the prostate and relieve the anatomical obstruction which produces urinary symptoms of BPH.[A242382] The decreased affinity of tadalafil for PDE6 compared to other PDE5 inhibitors may explain the reduced incidence of visual side effects.[L39100, L39105, A242287]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Rosuvastatin exerts an anti-inflammatory effect on rat mesenteric microvascular endothelium by attenuating leukocyte rolling, adherence and transmigration.[A1807] The drug also modulates nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression and reduces ischemic-reperfusion injuries in rat hearts.[A1787] Rosuvastatin increases the bioavailability of nitric oxide[A1807,A1799,A1787] by upregulating NOS[A1791] and by increasing the stability of NOS through post-transcriptional polyadenylation.[A1796] It is unclear as to how rosuvastatin brings about these effects though they may be due to decreased concentrations of mevalonic acid.', 'Rosuvastatin is a synthetic, enantiomerically pure antilipemic agent. It is used to lower total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and trigleride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, rosuvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A181087, A181406]



Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]



**Skeletal Muscle Effects**



Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. These risks can occur at any dose level, but are increased at the highest dose (40 mg). Rosuvastatin should be prescribed with caution in patients with predisposing factors for myopathy (e.g., age ≥ 65 years, inadequately treated hypothyroidism, renal impairment).



The risk of myopathy during treatment with rosuvastatin may be increased with concurrent administration of some other lipid-lowering therapies (such as [fenofibrate] or [niacin]), [gemfibrozil], [cyclosporine], [atazanavir]/[ritonavir], [lopinavir]/ritonavir, or [simeprevir].  Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin, coadministered with [colchicine], and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together.[F4649] 



Real-world data from observational studies has suggested that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]



**Liver Enzyme Abnormalities**



Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. In most cases, the elevations were transient and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. There were two cases of jaundice, for which a relationship to rosuvastatin therapy could not be determined, which resolved after discontinuation of therapy. There were no cases of liver failure or irreversible liver disease in these trials.[F4649]



**Endocrine Effects**



Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin calcium tablets. Based on clinical trial data with rosuvastatin, in some instances these increases may exceed the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.[F4649]



An in vitro study found that [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], and [pitavastatin] exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on human pancreas islet β cells, with reductions in cell viability of 32, 41, 34 and 29%, respectively, versus control]. Moreover, insulin secretion rates were decreased by 34, 30, 27 and 19%, respectively, relative to control.[A182012]



HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and lower cholesterol levels and, as such, might theoretically blunt adrenal or gonadal steroid hormone production. Rosuvastatin demonstrated no effect upon nonstimulated cortisol levels and no effect on thyroid metabolism as assessed by TSH plasma concentration. In rosuvastatin treated patients, there was no impairment of adrenocortical reserve and no reduction in plasma cortisol concentrations. Clinical studies with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have suggested that these agents do not reduce plasma testosterone concentration. The effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on male fertility have not been studied. The effects, if any, on the pituitarygonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown.[F4652]



**Cardiovascular**



Ubiquinone levels were not measured in rosuvastatin clinical trials, however significant decreases in circulating ubiquinone levels in patients treated with other statins have been observed. The clinical significance of a potential long-term statin-induced deficiency of ubiquinone has not been established. It has been reported that a decrease in myocardial ubiquinone levels could lead to impaired cardiac function in patients with borderline congestive heart failure.[F4652]



**Lipoprotein A**



In some patients, the beneficial effect of lowered total cholesterol and LDL-C levels may be partly blunted by a concomitant increase in the Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentrations. Present knowledge suggests the importance of high Lp(a) levels as an emerging risk factor for coronary heart disease. It is thus desirable to maintain and reinforce lifestyle changes in high-risk patients placed on rosuvastatin therapy.[F4652] Further studies have demonstrated statins affect Lp(a) levels differently in patients with dyslipidemia depending on their apo(a) phenotype; statins increase Lp(a) levels exclusively in patients with the low molecular weight apo(a) phenotype.[A181418]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

PGE<sub>2</sub> is the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.[A179023] It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.[T116,A179023] PGE<sub>2</sub> activates the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled EP<sub>1</sub> receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE<sub>2</sub> also activates the EP<sub>4</sub> receptor, coupled to G<sub>s</sub>, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE<sub>2</sub> act via EP<sub>3</sub> to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP<sub>2</sub> to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI<sub>2</sub> is known to play a role via its G<sub>s</sub>-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.



PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP<sub>2</sub> receptors.[T116,A179044] Similarly to β adrenergic receptors these are G<sub>s</sub>-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE<sub>2</sub> also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.[T116] PGD<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP<sub>1</sub> receptor.[A179044] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.



PGE<sub>2</sub> can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory G<sub>q</sub> EP<sub>3</sub> receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.[T116] This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever. NSAIDs prevent the generation of PGE<sub>2</sub> thereby reducing the activity of these neurons.

The organisms susceptible to cefdinir have been listed below in addition to their associated clinical condition that may be treated with cefdinir.[L7330] Various beta-lactamase producing organisms may be treated, as indicated in certain sections below.

This This 6-member ring enables cefdinir and other cephalosporins to resist inactivation by certain bacterial enzymes.[A180772]



With a mechanism similar to other beta-lactam antibiotics, the bactericidal activity of cefdinir is caused by the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Cefdinir, like other cephalosporins, penetrates the bacterial cell wall, combats inactivation by beta-lactamase enzymes, and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins.[A180772] This interferes with the final step of transpeptidation in cell walls, eventually leading to cell lysis, which eventually leads to the death of bacteria that are susceptible to this drug.[A180724] Cefdinir has shown affinity to penicillin protein binding proteins 2 and 3. [A15746,A180760,A15747] It has also been shown to inhibit transpeptidase enzymes of various bacteria, which may play a role in its bactericidal action.[A180766,A180769] One in vitro study suggests that cefdinir inhibits myeloperoxidase release extracellularly.[A11897] The impact of this potential drug target in relation to its mechanism of action is unknown.', 'Cefdinir is a bactericidal agent that treats bacterial infections by interfering with cell wall synthesis.[L7330]

Alprazolam may also be prescribed off-label for insomnia, premenstrual syndrome, and depression.[A177973]', 'Neurotransmission relies on excitatory and inhibitory signalling. γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type-A receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) are members of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (PLGIC) superfamily located synaptically and perisynaptically to mediate phasic inhibition and extrasynaptically to mediate tonic inhibition. GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs comprise a variety of subunits from a homologous family whose members are named based on sequence identity as one of α1-6, β1-3, γ1-3, δ, ε, θ, π, and ρ1-3. Each subunit possesses an extracellular (ECD), transmembrane (TMD), and intracellular (ICD) domain; inter-subunit interfaces are the primary points of neurotransmitter and modulator binding, described by coordination of the principal (+) and complementary (-) sites in each subunit. Binding of GABA to GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs induces pore opening, rapid flow of chloride ions, and synaptic hyperpolarization, which in turn manifests as an inhibitory signal.[A236793, A236798]



The most prevalent GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs _in vivo_ are the α1β2γ2 receptors, which contain both GABA (β+/α-) and benzodiazepine (BZD, α+/γ-) binding sites in the intersubunit interfaces of the relevant subunits.[A236793, A236798, A236828] In general, any receptors containing an α<sub>x</sub>/γ<sub>z</sub> interface, where x = 1-3,5 and z = 1-3, have potential high-affinity BZD binding sites, although small sequence differences between subunits may alter binding affinity to individual molecules. The α4 and α6 subunits, in which an otherwise conserved histidine is replaced by arginine, do not bind traditional BZD ligands such as diazepam and hence are considered "diazepam-insensitive".[A236793, A236798, A236828] GABA binding results in a series of conformational changes in the ECDs of GABA<sub>A</sub>R β subunits, "locking" each to its neighbouring α- interface. The binding of alprazolam in the high-affinity BZD site stabilizes the α+/γ- interface and facilitates the conformational changes that lead to pore opening, hence functioning as a positive allosteric modulator.[A236833]



The exact manner in which GABA<sub>A</sub>R allosteric modulation mediates the therapeutic and unwanted effects of benzodiazepines remains unclear.[A177973, A18125] Earlier studies suggested that the primary factor was the α subunit composition, with α1-containing receptors mediating the sedative effects, α2/3-containing receptors the anxiolytic effects, and α5-containing receptors the memory effects of benzodiazepines.[A236838] More recent studies suggest a more complex set of factors including subunit composition, physiological location, neuronal circuit, and nerve cell type.[A236843] To further complicate matters, there may be up to five distinct BZD binding sites on GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, with site 1 corresponding to the classical high-affinity α+/γ- interface. The effects of binding at sites 2-4 are not fully understood and likely impart greater complexity to benzodiazepine pharmacological action.[A236798, A236828]', 'Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine that binds γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type-A receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) to enhance their inhibitory effect on neurotransmission, specifically in the brain.[L34783, L34788] Concomitant use with opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death; patients taking benzodiazepines and opioids concurrently may require lower doses of one or both medications, depending on their clinical situation. Patients with pre-existing impaired respiratory function are at increased risk of adverse effects including death during treatment with benzodiazepines. In addition, due to its CNS depressant effects, patients taking alprazolam should avoid operating heavy machinery or driving and should avoid other CNS depressants such as alcohol. As with other benzodiazepines, alprazolam carries a risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which is higher in predisposed individuals and may require strict monitoring. Cessation of therapy may result in acute or protracted withdrawal symptoms, which may be life-threatening; the patient dose should be gradually tapered whenever discontinuation or reduced dosage are necessary. Newborns born to mothers using alprazolam later in pregnancy may suffer from sedation and withdrawal symptoms. As CYP3A is required for the initial step in alprazolam metabolism, alprazolam is contraindicated in patients taking strong CYP3A inhibitors, such as ketoconazole and itraconazole; milder CYP3A inhibitors still necessitate alprazolam dosage adjustments.

Haloperidol is also indicated in the short-term treatment of hyperactive children who show excessive motor activity with accompanying conduct disorders consisting of some or all of the following symptoms: impulsivity, difficulty sustaining attention, aggressivity, mood lability, and poor frustration tolerance. Haloperidol should be reserved for these two groups of children only after failure to respond to psychotherapy or medications other than antipsychotics.[F4645]', 'While haloperidol has demonstrated pharmacologic activity at a number of receptors in the brain, it exerts its antipsychotic effect through its strong antagonism of the dopamine receptor (mainly D2), particularly within the mesolimbic and mesocortical systems of the brain. Schizophrenia is theorized to be caused by a hyperdopaminergic state within the limbic system of the brain.[A34360] Dopamine-antagonizing medications such as haloperidol, therefore, are thought to improve psychotic symptoms by halting this over-production of dopamine. The optimal clinical efficacy of antipsychotics is associated with the blockade of approximately 60 % - 80 % of D2 receptors in the brain.[A34360]



While the exact mechanism is not entirely understood, haloperidol is known to inhibit the effects of dopamine and increase its turnover. Traditional antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, bind more tightly than dopamine itself to the dopamine D2 receptor, with dissociation constants that are lower than that for dopamine.[A4962] It is believed that haloperidol competitively blocks post-synaptic dopamine (D2) receptors in the brain, eliminating dopamine neurotransmission and leading to the relief of delusions and hallucinations that are commonly associated with psychosis. It acts primarily on the D2-receptors and has some effect on 5-HT2 and α1-receptors, with negligible effects on dopamine  D1-receptors. The drug also exerts some blockade of α-adrenergic receptors of the autonomic system.[L2022]



Antagonistic activity regulated through dopamine D2 receptors in the chemoreceptive trigger zone (CTZ) of the brain renders its antiemetic activity. Of the three D2-like receptors, only the D2 receptor is blocked by antipsychotic drugs in direct relation to their clinical antipsychotic abilities. 



Clinical brain-imaging findings show that haloperidol remains tightly bound to D2 dopamine receptors in humans undergoing 2 positron emission tomography (PET) scans with a 24h pause in between scans.[A4962] A common adverse effect of this drug is the development of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), due to this tight binding of haloperidol to the dopamine D2 receptor.



Due to the risk of unpleasant and sometimes lifelong extrapyramidal symptoms, newer antipsychotic medications than haloperidol have been discovered and formulated. Rapid dissociation of drugs from dopamine D2 receptors is a plausible explanation for the improved EPS profile of atypical antipsychotics such as [DB00734]. This is also consistent with the theory of a lower affinity for D2 receptors for these drugs.  As mentioned above, haloperidol binds tightly to the dopamine receptor, potentiating the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms,[A4962] and therefore should only been used when necessary.', 'Use of the first-generation antipsychotics (including haloperidol) is considered highly effective for the management of the "positive" symptoms of schizophrenia including hallucinations, hearing voices, aggression/hostility, disorganized speech, and psychomotor agitation. However, this class is limited by the development of movement disorders such as drug-induced parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, and tardive dyskinesia, and other side effects including sedation, weight gain, and prolactin changes. Compared to the lower-potency first-generation antipsychotics such as [DB00477], [DB01624], [DB00623], and [DB01403], haloperidol typically demonstrates the least amount of side effects within class, but demonstrates a stronger disposition for causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).[A180613, A180616, A180625] Low‐potency medications have a lower affinity for dopamine receptors so that a higher dose is required to effectively treat symptoms of schizophrenia. In addition, they block many receptors other than the primary target (dopamine receptors), such as cholinergic or histaminergic receptors, resulting in a higher incidence of side effects such as sedation, weight gain, and hypotension.



The balance between the wanted drug effects on psychotic symptoms and unwanted side effects are largely at play within dopaminergic brain pathways affected by haloperidol. Cortical dopamine-D2-pathways play an important role in regulating these effects and include the nigrostriatal pathway, which is responsible for causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways, which are responsible for the improvement in positive schizophrenic symptoms, and the tuberoinfundibular dopamine pathway, which is responsible for hyperprolactinemia. 



A syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome.[F4645]



Cases of sudden death, QT-prolongation, and Torsades de Pointes have been reported in patients receiving haloperidol. Higher than recommended doses of any formulation and intravenous administration of haloperidol appear to be associated with a higher risk of QT-prolongation and Torsades de Pointes. Although cases have been reported even in the absence of predisposing factors, particular caution is advised in treating patients with other QT-prolonging conditions (including electrolyte imbalance [particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia], drugs known to prolong QT, underlying cardiac abnormalities, hypothyroidism, and familial long QT-syndrome).[F4645]



A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status (including catatonic signs) and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure.[F4645]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

This binding results in displacement of divalent cations and increased membrane permeability, allowing for aminoglycoside entry.[A232294, A232304, A232309, A232314]

The second “energy-dependent phase I” of aminoglycoside entry into the cytoplasm relies on the proton-motive force and allows a limited amount of aminoglycoside access to its primary intracellular target - the bacterial 30S ribosome.[A232294, A232314] This ultimately results in the mistranslation of proteins and disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane.[A233320] Finally, in the “energy-dependent phase II” stage, concentration-dependent bacterial killing is observed. Aminoglycoside rapidly accumulates in the cell due to the damaged cytoplasmic membrane, and protein mistranslation and synthesis inhibition is amplified.[A232294, A232314, A232319] The necessity of oxygen-dependent active transport explains why aminoglycosides are ineffective against anaerobic bacteria.[A234130]

Hence, aminoglycosides have both immediate bactericidal effects through membrane disruption and delayed bactericidal effects through impaired protein synthesis; observed experimental data and mathematical modeling support this two-mechanism model.[A232294, A232299]

Inhibition of protein synthesis is a key component of aminoglycoside efficacy. Structural and cell biological studies suggest that aminoglycosides bind to the 16S rRNA in helix 44 (h44), near the A site of the 30S ribosomal subunit, altering interactions between h44 and h45. This binding also displaces two important residues, A1492 and A1493, from h44, mimicking normal conformational changes that occur with successful codon-anticodon pairing in the A site.[A232324, A232329] Overall, aminoglycoside binding has several negative effects including inhibition of translation, initiation, elongation, and ribosome recycling.[A232294, A232334, A232339] Recent evidence suggests that the latter effect is due to a cryptic second binding site situated in h69 of the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit.[A232329, A232339] Also, by stabilizing a conformation that mimics correct codon-anticodon pairing, aminoglycosides promote error-prone translation.[A232344] Mistranslated proteins can incorporate into the cell membrane, inducing the damage discussed above.[A232294, A232319]', NULL, 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Fludrocortisone binding to mineralocorticoid receptors causes alterations to DNA transcription and translation of proteins that result in an increased density of sodium channels on the apical side of renal tubule cells and an increased density of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase on the basolateral side.[T28] These increases in receptor density result in increased plasma sodium concentrations, and thus increased blood pressure, as well as a decreased plasma potassium concentration.

Fludrocortisone also acts on glucocorticoid receptors, albeit with a much lower affinity - the glucocorticoid potency of fludrocortisone is approximately 5-10 times that of endogenous cortisol, whereas its mineralocorticoid potency is 200-400 times greater.[A5423]', 'Fludrocortisone is a synthetic mineralocorticoid used to replace endogenous [aldosterone] in conditions resulting in missing or inadequate endogenous synthesis.[L8971,L8974] It acts on the kidneys to increase both sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion.[T28,A187187] As its effects are exerted at the transcriptional level, a single dose of fludrocortisone may work over the course of 1-2 days[L8974] despite a relatively short plasma half-life.[A187159,A187169,A187181] Like other systemic corticosteroids, fludrocortisone may mask signs of infection by depressing the normal immune response - infections occurring during fludrocortisone therapy should be promptly treated with appropriate antimicrobial therapy.[L8971]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Using vitamin B12 as a cofactor, folic acid can normalize high homocysteine levels by remethylation of homocysteine to methionine via methionine synthetase.', 'Folic acid is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin found in foods such as liver, kidney, yeast, and leafy, green vegetables. Also known as folate or Vitamin B9, folic acid is an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in DNA and RNA synthesis. More specifically, folic acid is required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. Folic acid is the precursor of tetrahydrofolic acid, which is involved as a cofactor for transformylation reactions in the biosynthesis of purines and thymidylates of nucleic acids. Impairment of thymidylate synthesis in patients with folic acid deficiency is thought to account for the defective deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis that leads to megaloblast formation and megaloblastic and macrocytic anemias. Folic acid is particularly important during phases of rapid cell division, such as infancy, pregnancy, and erythropoiesis, and plays a protective factor in the development of cancer. As humans are unable to synthesize folic acid endogenously, diet and supplementation is necessary to prevent deficiencies. In order to function properly within the body, folic acid must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted by anti-metabolite therapies such as [DB00563] as they function as DHFR inhibitors to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, and therefore prevent the formation of DHF and THF.

The safety and effectiveness of tegaserod in men with IBS-C have not been established [F4223, F4229].', 'Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a complex functional disorder comprised of various abnormal and discomforting effects on the gastrointestinal tract and bowel function [A176669, F4223, F4226, F4229]. Although the cause of IBS has yet to be formally elucidated, patient experience has demonstrated that the disorder is typically associated with abdominal pain, abdominal distension, cramping or bloating, variations in urgency for bowel movements, feelings of incomplete evacuation, gastroesophageal reflux, and various other effects [A176669, F4223, F4226, F4229]. In particular, IBS that features constipation as a predominant effect is categorized as constipation-predominant IBS, or IBS-C [F4223, F4229].



Concurrently, 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, or serotonin) has demonstrated the ability to elicit significant regulatory actions on gastrointestinal motility [A11044]. Specifically, it has been shown that the activation of 5-HT(4) receptors located on motor neurons and interneurons in the gastrointestinal wall can cause the release of acetylcholine, substance P, and calcitonin gene-related peptide that can all facilitate the propulsion of material through the gut [A11044]. Moreover, when 5-HT(4) receptors located in smooth muscle cells are also activated, activities that may alleviate symptoms of IBS-C like esophageal relaxation and the inhibition of human colonic circular muscle contraction can also occur [A11044]. Additionally, activating 5-HT(4) on enteric neurons and enterocytes also cause natural fluid secretion in the gut - an action which also strongly assists in promoting the movement of content along the gastrointestinal tract [A11044].



Alternatively, it has also been observed that 5-HT may participate in generating visceral hyperalgesia in IBS, an observation supported in part by the finding of increased amounts of 5-HT and its metabolites in the plasma of patients experiencing IBS [A176762] It has therefore also been proposed that antagonism of 5-HT(2B) receptors can lead to inhibition of both 5-HT mediated gastrointestinal motility and visceral hypersensitivity [A11044].



Subsequently, because tegaserod is considered to be an agonist of the 5-HT(4) receptor and an antagonist of the 5-HT(2B) receptor at clinically relevant levels, it is believed that tegaserod may elicit its mechanism of action by facilitating activities associated with the activation and antagonism of the 5-HT(4) and 5-HT(2B) receptors, like stimulating peristaltic gastrointestinal reflexes and intestinal secretion, inhibiting visceral sensitivity, enhancing basal motor activity, and normalizing impaired motility throughout the gastrointestinal tract, among other actions [A11044, A176762, F4223, F4226, F4229]. ', 'In general, it has been determined that tegaserod is an agonist of serotonin type-4 (5-HT(4)) receptors, an antagonist at 5-HT(2B) receptors, but is expected to possess minimal binding to 5-HT(1) receptors, and virtually no affinity for 5-HT(3) or dopamine receptors [A11044, A176762, F4223].



In clinical trials with tegaserod, centrally analyzed ECGs were recorded in 4,605 male and female patients receiving tegaserod 6 mg twice daily or placebo for IBS-C and other related motility disorders [F4223, F4229]. No subject receiving the agent had an absolute QTcF above 480 ms [F4223, F4229]. An increase in QTcF of 30 to 60 ms was observed in 7% of patients receiving tegaserod and 8% receiving placebo [F4223, F4229]. An increase in QTcF of greater than 60 ms was observed in 0.3% and 0.2% of subjects, respectively [F4223, F4229]. The effects of tegaserod on the QTcF interval were ultimately not considered to be clinically meaningful [F4223, F4229].



Furthermore, it was determined that there is a potential for tegaserod and its main metabolite (the M29 metabolite) to increase platelet aggregation in vitro [F4223, F4229]. In one in vitro study, at concentrations up to 10-times the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) at the recommended dose, tegaserod significantly increased platelet aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner up to 74% (range 11% to 74%) compared to a control vehicle (with potentiation by various agonists) [F4223, F4229]. In another in vitro study, the M29 metabolite, at concentrations up to 0.6-times the Cmax of M29 also showed a 5% to 16% increase in platelet aggregation compared to the control vehicle [F4223, F4229]. The clinical implications of these in vitro platelet aggregation results remain unclear [F4223, F4229].', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

In addition, miconazole inhibits fungal peroxidase and catalase while not affecting NADH oxidase activity, leading to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).[A203636, A203639, A203642] Increased intracellular ROS leads to downstream pleiotropic effects and eventual apoptosis.[A203636]



Lastly, likely as a result of lanosterol demethylation inhibition, miconazole causes a rise in intracellular levels of farnesol.

Osteoclasts mediate resorption of bone.[A6366] When osteoclasts bind to bone they form podosomes, ring structures of F-actin.[A6366] Etidronic acid also inhibits V-ATPases in the osteoclast, though the exact subunits are unknown, preventing F-actin from forming podosomes.[A202229,A202247,A203360] Disruption of the podosomes causes osteoclasts to detach from bones, preventing bone resorption.[A6366]

It is also used in combination with [sacubitril].[L36445]', 'Valsartan belongs to the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs, which selectively bind to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) and prevent angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects. These include vasoconstriction, stimulation and synthesis of aldosterone and ADH, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium among others. Overall, valsartan''s physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium. 



Valsartan also affects the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays an important role in hemostasis and regulation of kidney, vascular, and cardiac functions. Pharmacological blockade of RAAS via  AT1 receptor blockade inhibits negative regulatory feedback within RAAS which is a contributing factor to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal disease. In particular, heart failure is associated with chronic activation of RAAS, leading to inappropriate fluid retention, vasoconstriction, and ultimately a further decline in left ventricular function. ARBs have been shown to have a protective effect on the heart by improving cardiac function, reducing afterload, increasing cardiac output and prevent ventricular hypertrophy.[A174154]



The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) class of medications (which includes drugs such as [ramipril], [lisinopril], and [perindopril]) inhibits the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II by inhibiting the ACE enzyme but does not prevent the formation of all angiotensin II. ARB activity is unique in that it blocks all angiotensin II activity, regardless of where or how it was synthesized. 



Valsartan is commonly used for the management of hypertension, heart failure, and type 2 diabetes-associated nephropathy, particularly in patients who are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors. ARBs such as valsartan have been shown in a number of large-scale clinical outcomes trials to improve cardiovascular outcomes including reducing risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, the progression of heart failure, and hospitalization.[A174124,A178153,A173869,A185324,A185327,A185333,A185342,A185345] Valsartan also slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy due to its renoprotective effects.[A174157,A174160,A174163] Improvements in chronic kidney disease with valsartan include both clinically and statistically significant decreases in urinary albumin and protein excretion in patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and in nondiabetic patients diagnosed with chronic kidney disease.[A174124,A173869]



Valsartan also binds to the AT2 receptor, however AT2 is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis like AT1. Valsartan has about 20,000-fold higher affinity for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. The increased plasma levels of angiotensin II following AT1 receptor blockade with valsartan may stimulate the unblocked AT2 receptor.[L11305]', 'Valsartan inhibits the pressor effects of angiotensin II with oral doses of 80 mg inhibiting the pressor effect by about 80% at peak with approximately 30% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. Removal of the negative feedback of angiotensin II causes a 2- to 3-fold rise in plasma renin and consequent rise in angiotensin II plasma concentration in hypertensive patients. Minimal decreases in plasma aldosterone were observed after administration of valsartan.



In multiple-dose studies in hypertensive patients, valsartan had no notable effects on total cholesterol, fasting triglycerides, fasting serum glucose, or uric acid.[L11305]



**Hypotension** 



Excessive hypotension was rarely seen (0.1%) in patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with valsartan alone. In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- and/or salt-depleted patients receiving high doses of diuretics, symptomatic hypotension may occur. This condition should be corrected prior to administration of valsartan, or the treatment should start under close medical supervision. 



Caution should be observed when initiating therapy in patients with heart failure. Patients with heart failure given valsartan commonly have some reduction in blood pressure, but discontinuation of therapy because of continuing symptomatic hypotension usually is not necessary when dosing instructions are followed. In controlled trials in heart failure patients, the incidence of hypotension in valsartan-treated patients was 5.5% compared to 1.8% in placebo-treated patients. 



If excessive hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized.[L11305]





**Impaired Renal Function**



Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and by diuretics. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on valsartan. Monitor renal function periodically in these patients. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on valsartan.[L11305]





**Hyperkalemia**



Some patients with heart failure have developed increases in potassium. These effects are usually minor and transient, and they are more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Dosage reduction and/or discontinuation of valsartan may be required.[L11305]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Empagliflozin is not approved for use in patients with type 1 diabetes.', 'The vast majority of glucose filtered through the glomerulus is reabsorbed within the proximal tubule, primarily via SGLT2 (sodium-glucose linked co-transporter-2) which is responsible for ~90% of the total glucose reabsorption within the kidneys. Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase on the basolateral membrane of proximal tubular cells utilize ATP to actively pump Na+ ions into the interstitium surrounding the tubule, establishing a Na<sup>+</sup> gradient within the tubular cell. SGLT2 on the apical membrane of these cells then utilize this gradient to facilitate secondary active co-transport of both Na+ and glucose out of the filtrate, thereby reabsorbing glucose back into the blood – inhibiting this co-transport, then, allows for a marked increase in glucosuria and decrease in blood glucose levels.[A203453] Empagliflozin is a potent inhibitor of renal SGLT2 transporters located in the proximal tubules of the kidneys and works to lower blood glucose levels via an increase in glucosuria.[L13688]

Haloperidol is also indicated in the short-term treatment of hyperactive children who show excessive motor activity with accompanying conduct disorders consisting of some or all of the following symptoms: impulsivity, difficulty sustaining attention, aggressivity, mood lability, and poor frustration tolerance. Haloperidol should be reserved for these two groups of children only after failure to respond to psychotherapy or medications other than antipsychotics.[F4645]', 'While haloperidol has demonstrated pharmacologic activity at a number of receptors in the brain, it exerts its antipsychotic effect through its strong antagonism of the dopamine receptor (mainly D2), particularly within the mesolimbic and mesocortical systems of the brain. Schizophrenia is theorized to be caused by a hyperdopaminergic state within the limbic system of the brain.[A34360] Dopamine-antagonizing medications such as haloperidol, therefore, are thought to improve psychotic symptoms by halting this over-production of dopamine. The optimal clinical efficacy of antipsychotics is associated with the blockade of approximately 60 % - 80 % of D2 receptors in the brain.[A34360]



While the exact mechanism is not entirely understood, haloperidol is known to inhibit the effects of dopamine and increase its turnover. Traditional antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, bind more tightly than dopamine itself to the dopamine D2 receptor, with dissociation constants that are lower than that for dopamine.[A4962] It is believed that haloperidol competitively blocks post-synaptic dopamine (D2) receptors in the brain, eliminating dopamine neurotransmission and leading to the relief of delusions and hallucinations that are commonly associated with psychosis. It acts primarily on the D2-receptors and has some effect on 5-HT2 and α1-receptors, with negligible effects on dopamine  D1-receptors. The drug also exerts some blockade of α-adrenergic receptors of the autonomic system.[L2022]



Antagonistic activity regulated through dopamine D2 receptors in the chemoreceptive trigger zone (CTZ) of the brain renders its antiemetic activity. Of the three D2-like receptors, only the D2 receptor is blocked by antipsychotic drugs in direct relation to their clinical antipsychotic abilities. 



Clinical brain-imaging findings show that haloperidol remains tightly bound to D2 dopamine receptors in humans undergoing 2 positron emission tomography (PET) scans with a 24h pause in between scans.[A4962] A common adverse effect of this drug is the development of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), due to this tight binding of haloperidol to the dopamine D2 receptor.



Due to the risk of unpleasant and sometimes lifelong extrapyramidal symptoms, newer antipsychotic medications than haloperidol have been discovered and formulated. Rapid dissociation of drugs from dopamine D2 receptors is a plausible explanation for the improved EPS profile of atypical antipsychotics such as [DB00734]. This is also consistent with the theory of a lower affinity for D2 receptors for these drugs.  As mentioned above, haloperidol binds tightly to the dopamine receptor, potentiating the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms,[A4962] and therefore should only been used when necessary.', 'Use of the first-generation antipsychotics (including haloperidol) is considered highly effective for the management of the "positive" symptoms of schizophrenia including hallucinations, hearing voices, aggression/hostility, disorganized speech, and psychomotor agitation. However, this class is limited by the development of movement disorders such as drug-induced parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, and tardive dyskinesia, and other side effects including sedation, weight gain, and prolactin changes. Compared to the lower-potency first-generation antipsychotics such as [DB00477], [DB01624], [DB00623], and [DB01403], haloperidol typically demonstrates the least amount of side effects within class, but demonstrates a stronger disposition for causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).[A180613, A180616, A180625] Low‐potency medications have a lower affinity for dopamine receptors so that a higher dose is required to effectively treat symptoms of schizophrenia. In addition, they block many receptors other than the primary target (dopamine receptors), such as cholinergic or histaminergic receptors, resulting in a higher incidence of side effects such as sedation, weight gain, and hypotension.



The balance between the wanted drug effects on psychotic symptoms and unwanted side effects are largely at play within dopaminergic brain pathways affected by haloperidol. Cortical dopamine-D2-pathways play an important role in regulating these effects and include the nigrostriatal pathway, which is responsible for causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways, which are responsible for the improvement in positive schizophrenic symptoms, and the tuberoinfundibular dopamine pathway, which is responsible for hyperprolactinemia. 



A syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome.[F4645]



Cases of sudden death, QT-prolongation, and Torsades de Pointes have been reported in patients receiving haloperidol. Higher than recommended doses of any formulation and intravenous administration of haloperidol appear to be associated with a higher risk of QT-prolongation and Torsades de Pointes. Although cases have been reported even in the absence of predisposing factors, particular caution is advised in treating patients with other QT-prolonging conditions (including electrolyte imbalance [particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia], drugs known to prolong QT, underlying cardiac abnormalities, hypothyroidism, and familial long QT-syndrome).[F4645]



A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status (including catatonic signs) and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias).

The exact mechanisms by which topiramate exerts pharmacological actions on seizures and migraines are currently not fully characterized.[A188336,L10544]  Several properties of this drug, however, are likely to contribute to its therapeutic effects. Topiramate has been observed to exert actions on voltage-dependent sodium channels, GABA receptors, and glutamate receptors.[A175249,L10544] 



Topiramate stimulates GABA-A receptor activity at brain non-benzodiazepine receptor sites and reduces glutamate activity at both AMPA and kainate receptors.

Its combination of orthosteric and allosteric activity on SERT allows for greater extracellular 5-HT levels, a faster onset of action, and greater efficacy as compared to other SSRIs. [A185825,A185726] The sustained elevation of synaptic 5-HT eventually causes desensitization of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> auto-receptors, which normally shut down endogenous 5-HT release in the presence of excess 5-HT - this desensitization may be necessary for the full clinical effect of SSRIs and may be responsible for their typically prolonged onset of action.[A185828,A185726]

Risperidone is additionally indicated in Canada for the short-term symptomatic management of aggression or psychotic symptoms in patients with severe dementia of the Alzheimer type unresponsive to nonpharmacological approaches.[L12906]



Risperidone is also used off-label for a number of conditions including as an adjunct to antidepressants in treatment-resistant depression.[A177226]', 'Though its precise mechanism of action is not fully understood, current focus is on the ability of risperidone to inhibit the D2 dopaminergic receptors and 5-HT2A serotonergic receptors in the brain. Schizophrenia is thought to result from an excess of dopaminergic D2 and serotonergic 5-HT2A activity, resulting in overactivity of central mesolimbic pathways and mesocortical pathways, respectively.[A1115, A1116, A1117]



D2 dopaminergic receptors are transiently inhibited by risperidone, reducing dopaminergic neurotransmission, therefore decreasing positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as delusions and hallucinations.[A251765] Risperidone binds transiently and with loose affinity to the dopaminergic D2 receptor, with an ideal receptor occupancy of 60-70% for optimal effect.[A1119,A31773] Rapid dissociation of risperidone from the D2 receptors contributes to decreased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), which occur with permanent and high occupancy blockade of D2 dopaminergic receptors.[A1118,A1119] Low-affinity binding and rapid dissociation from the D2 receptor distinguish risperidone from the traditional antipsychotic drugs. A higher occupancy rate of D2 receptors is said to increase the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms and is therefore to be avoided.[A1118,A1119,A31771] 

 

Increased serotonergic mesocortical activity in schizophrenia results in negative symptoms, such as depression and decreased motivation. The high-affinity binding of risperidone to 5-HT2A receptors leads to a decrease in serotonergic activity. In addition, 5-HT2A receptor blockade results in decreased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms, likely by increasing dopamine release from the frontal cortex, and not the nigrostriatal tract. Dopamine level is therefore not completely inhibited.[A1117,A1119] Through the above mechanisms, both serotonergic and D2 blockade by risperidone are thought to synergistically work to decrease the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms. 

 

Risperidone has also been said to be an antagonist of alpha-1 (α1), alpha-2 (α2), and histamine (H1) receptors.[A37034] Blockade of these receptors is thought to improve symptoms of schizophrenia, however the exact mechanism of action on these receptors is not fully understood at this time.[L12885]', 'The primary action of risperidone is to decrease dopaminergic and serotonergic pathway activity in the brain, therefore decreasing symptoms of schizophrenia and mood disorders.[A1115,A1116]

', 'IVIg interacts with a number of different components of the immune system, including cytokines, complement, Fc receptors and several cell surface immunocompetent molecules. IVIg also impacts different effector cells of the immune system (B and T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, etc.) and regulates a wide range of genes. Its main mechanism of actions are believed to be Fc-dependent and F(ab'')2-dependent. IVIg competitively blocks gamma Fc receptors, preventing the binding and ingestion of phagocytes and suppressing platelet depletion. IVIg contains a number of different antobodies, which prevent infection by attaching to the surface of invading pathogens and aiding in their disposal before they can infect cells. Antibodies remove pathogens via complement activation, agglutination or precipitation, pathogen receptor blocking, macrophage “tagging” or neutralization (via binding) of pathogen toxins. Intact IVIg and F(ab′)2 fragments of IVIg can also neutralize the activity of various autoantibodies.

The extended-release formulation of metformin is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Safety in children has not been determined to this date.[L12207]



**Metformin combination products**



Metformin is a component of a variety of combination products with other anti-diabetic agents. It is indicated, along with diet and exercise, to improve glycemic control in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in combination with DPP-4 inhibitors ([sitagliptin], [linagliptin], [alogliptin], or [saxagliptin]),[L11479,L40248,L40253,L40258,L40263] in combination with SGLT2 inhibitors ([canagliflozin], [empagliflozin], [ertugliflozin], or [dapagliflozin]),[L11479,L30503,L1134,L13679,L38729] or in combination with [pioglitazone].[L11419]', 'Metformin''s mechanisms of action are unique from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic drugs. Metformin decreases blood glucose levels by decreasing hepatic glucose production (also called gluconeogenesis), decreasing the intestinal absorption of glucose, and increasing insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.[L12207] It is well established that metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I activity, and it has since been generally postulated that its potent antidiabetic effects occur through this mechanism.[A36534, A36557]   The above processes lead to a decrease in blood glucose, managing type II diabetes and exerting positive effects on glycemic control.



After ingestion, the organic cation transporter-1 (OCT1) is responsible for the uptake of metformin into hepatocytes (liver cells). As this drug is positively charged, it accumulates in cells and in the mitochondria because of the membrane potentials across the plasma membrane as well as the mitochondrial inner membrane. Metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I, preventing the production of mitochondrial ATP leading to increased cytoplasmic ADP:ATP and AMP:ATP ratios.[A36534] These changes activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an enzyme that plays an important role in the regulation of glucose metabolism.[A176348] Aside from this mechanism, AMPK can be activated by a lysosomal mechanism involving other activators.  Following this process, increases in AMP:ATP ratio also inhibit _fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase_ enzyme, resulting in the inhibition of gluconeogenesis, while also inhibiting _adenylate cyclase_ and decreasing the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP),[A36534] a derivative of ATP used for cell signaling [A176351]. Activated AMPK phosphorylates two isoforms of acetyl-CoA carboxylase enzyme, thereby inhibiting fat synthesis and leading to fat oxidation, reducing hepatic lipid stores and increasing liver sensitivity to insulin.[A36534] 



In the intestines, metformin increases anaerobic glucose metabolism in enterocytes (intestinal cells), leading to reduced net glucose uptake and increased delivery of lactate to the liver. Recent studies have also implicated the gut as a primary site of action of metformin and suggest that the liver may not be as important for metformin action in patients with type 2 diabetes. Some of the ways metformin may play a role on the intestines is by promoting the metabolism of glucose by increasing glucagon-like peptide I (GLP-1) as well as increasing gut utilization of glucose.[A36534] 



In addition to the above pathway, the mechanism of action of metformin may be explained by other ways, and its exact mechanism of action has been under extensive study in recent years.[A36535, A36554, A36555, A36557]', '**General effects**



Insulin is an important hormone that regulates blood glucose levels.[T514] Type II diabetes is characterized by a decrease in sensitivity to insulin, resulting in elevations in blood glucose when the pancreas can no longer compensate. In patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, insulin is unable to exert adequate effects on tissues and cells (i.e. insulin resistance)[T514] and insulin deficiency may also be present.[L5753]



Metformin reduces hepatic production of glucose, decreases the intestinal absorption of glucose, and enhances insulin sensitivity by increasing both peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. In contrast with drugs of the sulfonylurea class, which lead to hyperinsulinemia, the secretion of insulin is unchanged with metformin use.[L12207]



**Effect on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c)**



HbA1c is an important periodic measure of glycemic control used to monitor diabetic patients. Fasting plasma glucose is also a useful and important measure of glycemic control. In a 29-week clinical trial of subjects diagnosed with type II diabetes, metformin decreased the fasting plasma glucose levels by an average of 59 mg/dL from baseline, compared to an average increase of 6.3 mg/dL from baseline in subjects taking a placebo.[L12207]  Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was decreased by about 1.4% in subjects receiving metformin, and increased by 0.4% in subjects receiving placebo only.[L12207]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

These folic acid congeners are transported across cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis where they are needed to maintain normal erythropoiesis, synthesize purine and thymidylate nucleic acids, interconvert amino acids, methylate tRNA, and generate and use formate. Using vitamin B12 as a cofactor, folic acid can normalize high homocysteine levels by remethylation of homocysteine to methionine via methionine synthetase.', 'Folic acid is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin found in foods such as liver, kidney, yeast, and leafy, green vegetables. Also known as folate or Vitamin B9, folic acid is an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in DNA and RNA synthesis. More specifically, folic acid is required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. Folic acid is the precursor of tetrahydrofolic acid, which is involved as a cofactor for transformylation reactions in the biosynthesis of purines and thymidylates of nucleic acids. Impairment of thymidylate synthesis in patients with folic acid deficiency is thought to account for the defective deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis that leads to megaloblast formation and megaloblastic and macrocytic anemias. Folic acid is particularly important during phases of rapid cell division, such as infancy, pregnancy, and erythropoiesis, and plays a protective factor in the development of cancer. As humans are unable to synthesize folic acid endogenously, diet and supplementation is necessary to prevent deficiencies. In order to function properly within the body, folic acid must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF).

Hypromellose also acts to lubricate and protect the eye [L1809].



The surface active properties of the vehicles found in artificial tears solutions act to stabilize the tear film and increase tear viscosity to prevent delay tear evaporation and delay tear drainage [L1805].



In the intact eye, the corneal surface is moistened primarily by the mucin that is produced in the conjunctiva. Mucin is adsorbed on the corneal surface and forms a hydrophilic surface. This creates a moisture barrier. In the typical dry eye, and particularly in case of mucin deficiency, the application of artificial tear fluid is highly recommended. Both its surface activity and its adsorptive capacity make hypromellose optimal for this use. Hypromellose has a physical-chemical action and leads to, in an aqueous solution, a reduced surface tension as well as an increased level of viscosity. Hypromellose adheres well to the cornea and conjunctiva and provides ample moisture. Irritation symptoms caused by blinking, which occur in the case of tear fluid deficiency, are therefore decreased and symptoms of epithelial desiccation are also alleviated [L1809].



', 'Hypromellose is the most commonly used in hydrophilic matrix fabrication. It allows for controlled release of drug substances, increasing duration of therapeutic effects [L1803].  The physical characteristics of this drug resemble natural tears, providing lubrication to the ocular surface and maintaining corneal hydration in dry eye syndromes [L1811].



Hypromellose is considered an inert substance as it has no direct pharmacological activity. The viscosity promoting properties of hypromellose prolong the retention time and improve adhesion of synthetic tears to the cornea and conjunctiva. As a result, the tear film breakdown time is prolonged and/or the tear film stability is enhanced. A stable tear film protects the cornea from dryness and epithelial cells [L1809].





Hypromellose is a methyl and hydroxypropyl mixed ether of cellulose. It is utilized as artificial tears to prevent conjunctival and corneal damage due to impaired lacrimal secretions.

Current knowledge suggests that levetiracetam’s binding to synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) is a key driver of its action. SV2A is a membrane-bound protein that is found on synaptic vesicles and is ubiquitous throughout the CNS[A12546] - it appears to play a role in vesicle exocytosis[L8606,L8615] and in the modulation of synaptic transmission by increasing the available amount of secretory vesicles available for neurotransmission.[A12552] Stimulation of pre-synaptic SV2A by levetiracetam may inhibit neurotransmitter release,[A12551] but this action does not appear to affect normal neurotransmission. This has led to the suggestion that levetiracetam exclusively modulates the function of SV2A only under pathophysiological conditions.[A12546] Levetiracetam and related analogues showed a correlation between affinity for SV2A and anti-epileptic potency, further suggesting that action at this site contributes to the anti-epileptic activity of the drug.[L8606,L8615]

Neuroendocrine cells called enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells lie close to the parietal cells and regulate the basal secretion of histamine. Histamine release is also promoted from stimulation by acetylcholine and gastrin, a peptide hormone. Gastrin (G) cells release gastrin, which works on CCK<sub>2</sub> receptors on ECL cells. This action promotes the release of histamine from ECL cells. Upon release, histamine acts on H<sub>2</sub> receptors expressed on the basolateral membrane of parietal cells, leading to increased intracellular cAMP levels and activated proton pumps on parietal cells. Proton pump releases more protons into the stomach, thereby increasing the secretion of acid. [T28] In conditions that are associated with acid hypersecretion such as ulcers, there is a loss of regulation of acid secretion. Famotidine works on H<sub>2</sub> receptors and blocks the actions of histamine.[L11166]', 'Famotidine decreases the production of gastric acid, suppresses acid concentration and pepsin content, and decreases the volume of gastric secretion. Famotidine inhibits both basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, as well as acid secretion stimulated by food, caffeine, insulin, and pentagastrin.[L11139,L11142]



Famotidine has a dose-dependent therapeutic action, with the highest dose having the most extended duration of action and the highest inhibitory effect on gastric acid secretion. Following oral administration, the onset of action is within one hour, and the peak effect is reached within 1-3 hours. The duration of effect is about 10-12 hours.[A189459]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

• Pathologic hypersecretory conditions in adults', 'Hydrochloric acid (HCl) secretion into the gastric lumen is a process regulated mainly by the H(+)/K(+)-ATPase of the proton pump [A175180], expressed in high quantities by the parietal cells of the stomach. ATPase is an enzyme on the parietal cell membrane that facilitates hydrogen and potassium exchange through the cell, which normally results in the extrusion of potassium and formation of HCl (gastric acid) [A174295].



Omeprazole is a member of a class of antisecretory compounds, the substituted _benzimidazoles_, that stop gastric acid secretion by selective inhibition of the _H+/K+ ATPase_ enzyme system. Proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole bind covalently to cysteine residues via disulfide bridges on the alpha subunit of the _H+/K+ ATPase_ pump, inhibiting gastric acid secretion for up to 36 hours [A175192].  This antisecretory effect is dose-related and leads to the inhibition of both basal and stimulated acid secretion, regardless of the stimulus [FDA label].  



**Mechanism of H. pylori eradication**



Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is frequently associated with _Helicobacter pylori_ bacterial infection (NSAIDs) [A175195]. The treatment of H. pylori infection may include the addition of omeprazole or other proton pump inhibitors as part of the treatment regimen [FDA label], [A175198]. 

_H. pylori_ replicates most effectively at a neutral pH [A175213]. Acid inhibition in H. pylori eradication therapy, including proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole, raises gastric pH, discouraging the growth of H.pylori [A175198]. It is generally believed that proton pump inhibitors inhibit the _urease_ enzyme, which increases the pathogenesis of H. pylori in gastric-acid related conditions [A175216].   ', '**Effects on gastric acid secretion**



This drug decreases gastric acid secretion [FDA label]. After oral administration, the onset of the antisecretory effect of omeprazole is usually achieved within one hour, with the maximum effect occurring by 2 hours after administration. The inhibitory effect of omeprazole on acid secretion increases with repeated once-daily dosing, reaching a plateau after four days [FDA label].



**Effects on serum gastrin**



In studies of 200 or more patients, serum gastrin levels increased during the first 1-2 weeks of daily administration of therapeutic doses of omeprazole. This occurred in a parallel fashion with the inhibition of acid secretion. No further increase in serum gastrin occurred with continued omeprazole administration. Increased gastrin causes enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and increased serum Chromogranin A (CgA) levels. The increased CgA levels may lead to false positive results in diagnostic studies for neuroendocrine tumors [FDA label].



**Enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell effects**



Human gastric biopsy samples have been obtained from more than 3000 pediatric and adult patients treated with omeprazole in long-term clinical studies. The incidence of enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia in these studies increased with time; however, no case of ECL cell carcinoids, dysplasia, or neoplasia have been identified in these patients. These studies, however, are of insufficient in power and duration to draw conclusions on the possible influence of long-term administration of omeprazole in the development of any premalignant or malignant conditions [FDA label]. 



**Other effects**



Systemic effects of omeprazole in the central nervous system, cardiovascular and respiratory systems have not been found to date. Omeprazole, given in oral doses of 30 or 40 mg for 2-4 weeks, showed no effect on thyroid function, carbohydrate metabolism, or circulating levels of parathyroid hormone, cortisol, estradiol, testosterone, prolactin, cholecystokinin or secretin [FDA label].

Dyslipidemia describes an elevation of plasma cholesterol, triglycerides or both as well as to the presence of low levels of high-density lipoprotein. This condition represents an increased risk for the development of atherosclerosis.[L6025] 



Atorvastatin is indicated, in combination with dietary modifications, to prevent cardiovascular events in patients with cardiac risk factors and/or abnormal lipid profiles.[A177397]



Atorvastatin can be used as a preventive agent for myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization, and angina, in patients without coronary heart disease but with multiple risk factors and in patients with type 2 diabetes without coronary heart disease but multiple risk factors.[A177397]



Atorvastatin may be used as a preventive agent for non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal and non-fatal stroke, revascularization procedures, hospitalization for congestive heart failure and angina in patients with coronary heart disease.[A177397]



Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]', 'Atorvastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A177388,A181421] Atorvastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, which increases hepatic uptake of LDL. Atorvastatin also reduces Very-Low-Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol (VLDL-C), serum triglycerides (TG) and Intermediate Density Lipoproteins (IDL), as well as the number of apolipoprotein B (apo B) containing particles, but increases High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C). 



_In vitro_ and _in vivo_ animal studies also demonstrate that atorvastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] These effects include improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response. Statins were also found to bind allosterically to β2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an essential role in leukocyte trafficking and T cell activation.[A181559]', 'Atorvastatin is an oral antilipemic agent that reversibly inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. It lowers total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apo B), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease, and high ratios are associated with a higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, atorvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A174580,A181087,A181406,A181925] 



Elevated cholesterol levels (and high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in particular) are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Clinical studies have shown that atorvastatin reduces LDL-C and total cholesterol by 36-53%.[A177415] In patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia, atorvastatin reduced the levels of intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol.[A177397] It has also been suggested that atorvastatin can limit the extent of angiogenesis, which can be useful in the treatment of chronic subdural hematoma.[A177388]



**Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis**



Atorvastatin, like other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, is associated with a risk of drug-induced myopathy characterized by muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness in conjunction with elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK). Myopathy often manifests as rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria. The risk of statin-induced myopathy is dose-related, and the symptoms of myopathy are typically resolved upon drug discontinuation. Results from observational studies suggest that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]



**Liver Dysfunction**



Statins, like some other lipid-lowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (> 3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] occurring on two or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin in clinical trials. This effect appears to be dose-related.[F4670,F4673]



**Endocrine Effects**



Statins are associated with a risk of increased serum HbA1c and glucose levels. An _in vitro_ study demonstrated a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on human pancreatic islet β cells following treatment with atorvastatin. Moreover, insulin secretion rates decreased relative to control.[A182012]



HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and may theoretically interfere with the production of adrenal and/or gonadal steroids. Clinical studies with atorvastatin and other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have suggested that these agents do not affect plasma cortisol concentrations, basal plasma testosterone concentration, or adrenal reserve. However, the effect of statins on male fertility has not been fully investigated. The effects of statins on the pituitary-gonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown.[F4673]



**Cardiovascular**



Significant decreases in circulating ubiquinone levels in patients treated with atorvastatin and other statins have been observed. The clinical significance of a potential long-term statin-induced deficiency of ubiquinone has not been established. It has been reported that a decrease in myocardial ubiquinone levels could lead to impaired cardiac function in patients with borderline congestive heart failure.[F4673]



**Lipoprotein A**



In some patients, the beneficial effect of lowered total cholesterol and LDL-C levels may be partly blunted by the concomitant increase in Lp(a) lipoprotein concentrations. Present knowledge suggests the importance of high Lp(a) levels as an emerging risk factor for coronary heart disease.[F4673] Further studies have demonstrated statins affect Lp(a) levels differently in patients with dyslipidemia depending on their apo(a) phenotype; statins increase Lp(a) levels exclusively in patients with the low molecular weight apo(a) phenotype.[A181418]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Interestingly, bevacizumab is currently under investigation for the treatment of COVID-19 complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI).[L12699] ', 'Transcription of the VEGF protein is induced by ''hypoxia inducible factor'' (HIF) in a hypoxic environment.[A192939] When circulating VEGF binds to VEGF receptors (VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2) located on endothelial cells, various downstream effects are initiated.[A192834,A192939] It should be noted that VEGF also binds to the neuropilin co-receptors (NRP-1 and NRP-1), leading to enhanced signaling.[A192939,A192951] 



Cancer cells promote tumor angiogenesis by releasing VEGF, resulting in the creation of an immature and disorganized vascular network.[A192894,A192897] The hypoxic microenvironment promoted by cancer cells favors the survival of more aggressive tumor cells, and gives rise to a challenging environment for immune cells to respond appropriately.[A192897,A192900,A192903] As a result, VEGF has become a well-known target for anti-cancer drugs like bevacizumab.[A192837] Bevacizumab is a mAb that exerts its effects by binding and inactivating serum VEGF.[A192939] When bound to the mAb, VEGF is unable to interact with its cell surface receptors, and proangiogenic signalling is inhibited.[A192939] This prevents formation of new blood vessels, decreases tumor vasculature, and reduces tumor blood supply.[A192939,L12648] 



There is also evidence to suggest that VEGF is upregulated in COVID-19 patients, hence, bevacizumab is being investigated for the treatment of associated complications.[L12699] Higher levels of VEGF may contribute to pulmonary edema, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI).[L12699] Researchers are hopeful that by inhibiting VEGF, bevacizumab may effectively treat ARDS and ALI - both common features of severe COVID-19 cases.[L12699]', 'Bevacizumab binds circulating vascular endothelial-derived growth factor (VEGF) and blocks it from binding to its associated receptors, effectively blunting downstream signaling.[A192963] The effects of bevacizumab have been shown to re-establish normal vasculature at the tumor site resulting in increased nutrient and oxygen supply, while also improving the delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs to the target area.[A192939,A192960] On the other hand, VEGF signaling is a vital component of several processes including angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, blood pressure regulation, wound healing, coagulation, and renal filtration.[A192834,A192888,A192963] Although blocking VEGF may inhibit metastatic disease progression, it may also result in unintended effects due to the role of VEGF in several other physiologic processes.[L12648]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Olmesartan is also used off-label for the management Type 2 Diabetes-associated nephropathy, heart failure, and post-myocardial infarction, particularly in patients who are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors.[A178153,A185912,A185915] ARBs such as olmesartan have been shown in a number of large-scale clinical outcomes trials to improve cardiovascular outcomes including reducing risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, the progression of heart failure, and hospitalization.[A174124,A178153,A173869,A185324,A185327,A185333,A185342,A185345] Like other ARBs, olmesartan blockade of RAAS slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy due to its renoprotective effects.[A185906,A185909,A185912] ', 'Olmesartan belongs to the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs, which also includes [telmisartan], [candesartan], [losartan], [valsartan], and [irbesartan]. ARBs selectively bind to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) and prevent the protein angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects. As the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, Angiotensin II causes vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis.[F4709] Overall, olmesartan''s physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium. 



Olmesartan also effects on the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an important role in hemostasis and regulation of kidney, vascular, and cardiac functions. Pharmacological blockade of RAAS via  AT1 receptor blockade inhibits negative regulatory feedback within RAAS, which is a contributing factor to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal disease. In particular, heart failure is associated with chronic activation of RAAS, leading to inappropriate fluid retention, vasoconstriction, and ultimately a further decline in left ventricular function. ARBs have been shown to have a protective effect on the heart by improving cardiac function, reducing afterload, increasing cardiac output and preventing ventricular hypertrophy and remodelling.[A174154] ', 'Overall, olmesartan''s physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium. 





**Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients**



In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, such as volume-and/or salt-depleted patients (e.g., those being treated with high doses of diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may be anticipated after initiation of treatment with olmesartan. Initiate treatment under close medical supervision. If hypotension does occur, place the patient in the supine position and, if necessary, give an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized.[F4709,F4712]



Valvular Stenosis: there is concern on theoretical grounds that patients with aortic stenosis might be at a particular risk of decreased coronary perfusion, because they do not develop as much afterload reduction.[F4712]





**Impaired Renal Function**



As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with olmesartan. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and rarely with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with olmesartan.



In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) have been reported. There has been no long-term use of olmesartan medoxomil in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but similar results may be expected.[F4709,F4712]





**Sprue-like Enteropathy**



Severe, chronic diarrhea with substantial weight loss has been reported in patients taking olmesartan months to years after drug initiation. Intestinal biopsies of patients often demonstrated villous atrophy. If a patient develops these symptoms during treatment with olmesartan, exclude other etiologies. Consider discontinuation of olmesartan medoxomil in cases where no other etiology is identified.[F4709,F4712]

This is followed by maintenance treatment with either durvalumab as monotherapy or in combination with [olaparib] in endometrial cancer that is mismatch repair deficient (dMMR).[L12627]', 'Because cancer cells express antigens that are recognized and taken up by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), the immune responses prime and activate cytotoxic T cells, and allow them to travel to the site of the tumour to destroy cancer cells. However, tumours often evade T cell-mediated immune responses to enhance their survival.[A192798] Inflammatory mediators, such as IFN-gamma, induce the expression of programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1), which is a type 1 transmembrane protein expressed on tumour cells and tumour-associated immune cells in the tumour microenvironment.[A192789,L12621] PD-L1 acts as an immune checkpoint to regulate immune responses. PD-L1 is a ligand to PD-1, which is a cell surface receptor expressed on activated T cells in peripheral tissues following antigen exposure.[A192789,A192801] Both PD-L1 and PD-1 are co-inhibitory molecules involved in blocking T cell-mediated immune responses. PD-L1 also interacts with CD-80, which is a receptor constitutively expressed by T cells and is upregulated early after T cell activation.[A193005]



The expression of PD-L1 is an adaptive immune response by tumour cells, resulting in the over-expression of the molecule in some cancers.[A192801] PD-L1 interacts with PD-1 and CD80, which leads to blocked cytotoxic T cell activation, T cell proliferation, and cytokine production.[L12621] By binding to PD-L1 and preventing its association with PD-1 and CD80, durvalumab activates the immune responses mediated by cytotoxic T cells that attack tumour cells.[L12621] Durvalumab displays selective and high affinity toward PD-L1 but not PD-L2, which is a regulatory ligand expressed in tumour cells to a lesser extent and involved in regulating inflammation and differentiation of T cells.[A192789]', 'Durvalumab is an anticancer antibody that works to promote the antitumour responses mediated by immune cells. By blocking the action of PD-L1, durvalumab exerts its anticancer effects by increasing T-cell activation, enhancing detection and ablation of tumour cells.[L12621] In _in vitro_ assays, durvalumab inhibited the activity of PD-L1 in a concentration-dependent manner.[A192807] In co-engrafted human tumor and immune cell xenograft mouse models, durvalumab was effective in decreasing tumour size.

Animal research studies have demonstrated that carbamazepine exerts its effects by lowering polysynaptic nerve response and inhibiting post-tetanic potentiation. In both cats and rats, carbamazepine was shown to decrease pain caused by infraorbital nerve stimulation. A decrease in the action potential in the nucleus ventralis of the thalamus in the brain and inhibition of the lingual mandibular reflex were observed in other studies after carbamazepine use. Carbamazepine causes the above effects by binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels and preventing action potentials, which normally lead to stimulatory effects on nerves.[A180403,T634] In bipolar disorder, carbamazepine is thought to increase dopamine turnover and increase GABA transmission, treating manic and depressive symptoms.[L7216]



A common issue that has arisen is resistance to this drug in up to 30% of epileptic patients, which may occur to altered metabolism in patients with variant genotypes.[A180436] A potential therapeutic target to combat carbamazepine resistance has recently been identified as the EPHX1 gene promoter, potentially conferring resistance to carbamazepine through methylation.[A180439]', '**General effects**



Carbamazepine treats seizures and the symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia by inhibiting sodium channels.  In bipolar 1 disorder, carbamazepine has been found to decrease mania symptoms in a clinically significant manner according to the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS).[L1335] Carbamazepine has a narrow therapeutic index.[A180301]

The retention of phosphate plays a pivotal role in causing secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with osteodystrophy, and soft-tissue calcification. The mechanism by which phosphate retention leads to hyperparathyroidism is not clearly delineated. Therapeutic efforts directed toward the control of hyperphosphatemia include reduction in the dietary intake of phosphate, inhibition of absorption of phosphate in the intestine with phosphate binders, and removal of phosphate from the body by more efficient methods of dialysis. The rate of removal of phosphate by dietary manipulation or by dialysis is insufficient. Dialysis patients absorb 40% to 80% of dietary phosphorus. Therefore, the fraction of dietary phosphate absorbed from the diet needs to be reduced by using phosphate binders in most renal failure patients on maintenance dialysis. Calcium acetate when taken with meals combines with dietary phosphate to form insoluble calcium phosphate which is excreted in the feces. Maintenance of serum phosphorus below 6.0 mg/dl is generally considered as a clinically acceptable outcome of treatment with phosphate binders.

', 'The dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor is a 7-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor associated with G<sub>i</sub> proteins. In lactotrophs, stimulation of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> causes inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, which decreases intracellular cAMP concentrations and blocks IP3-dependent release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores. Decreases in intracellular calcium levels may also be brought about via inhibition of calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels, rather than via inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Additionally, receptor activation blocks phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK and decreases MAPK/ERK kinase phosphorylation. Inhibition of MAPK appears to be mediated by c-Raf and B-Raf-dependent inhibition of MAPK/ERK kinase. Dopamine-stimulated growth hormone release from the pituitary gland is mediated by a decrease in intracellular calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels rather than via adenylyl cyclase inhibition. Stimulation of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway leads to improvements in coordinated muscle activity in those with movement disorders. Cabergoline is a long-acting dopamine receptor agonist with a high affinity for D2 receptors. Receptor-binding studies indicate that cabergoline has low affinity for dopamine D1, &alpha;<sub>1</sub>,- and &alpha;<sub>2</sub>- adrenergic, and 5-HT<sub>1</sub>- and 5-HT<sub>2</sub>-serotonin receptors.', 'Cabergoline stimulates centrally-located dopaminergic receptors resulting in a number of pharmacologic effects. Five dopamine receptor types from two dopaminergic subfamilies have been identified. The dopaminergic D1 receptor subfamily consists of D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>5</sub> subreceptors, which are associated with dyskinesias. The dopaminergic D2 receptor subfamily consists of D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub> and D<sub>4</sub> subreceptors, which are associated with improvement of symptoms of movement disorders. Thus, agonist activity specific for D2 subfamily receptors, primarily D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> receptor subtypes, are the primary targets of dopaminergic antiparkinsonian agents. It is thought that postsynaptic D2 stimulation is primarily responsible for the antiparkinsonian effect of dopamine agonists, while presynaptic D2 stimulation confers neuroprotective effects. This semisynthetic ergot derivative exhibits potent agonist activity on dopamine D<sub>2</sub>- and D<sub>3</sub>-receptors. It also exhibits: agonist activity (in order of decreasing binding affinities) on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)<sub>2B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>, dopamine D<sub>4</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, dopamine D<sub>1</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors and antagonist activity on &alpha;<sub>2B</sub>, &alpha;<sub>2A</sub>, and &alpha;<sub>2C</sub> receptors. Parkinsonian Syndrome manifests when approximately 80% of dopaminergic activity in the nigrostriatal pathway of the brain is lost. As this striatum is involved in modulating the intensity of coordinated muscle activity (e.g. movement, balance, walking), loss of activity may result in dystonia (acute muscle contraction), Parkinsonism (including symptoms of bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, and flattened affect), akathesia (inner restlessness), tardive dyskinesia (involuntary muscle movements usually associated with long-term loss of dopaminergic activity), and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which manifests when complete blockage of nigrostriatal dopamine occurs. High dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain causes hallucinations and delusions; these side effects of dopamine agonists are manifestations seen in patients with schizophrenia who have overractivity in this area of the brain. The hallucinogenic side effects of dopamine agonists may also be due to 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> agonism. The tuberoinfundibular pathway of the brain originates in the hypothalamus and terminates in the pituitary gland. In this pathway, dopamine inhibits lactotrophs in anterior pituitary from secreting prolactin. Increased dopaminergic activity in the tuberoinfundibular pathway inhibits prolactin secretion.

2) Symptomatic relief in osteoarthritis.', 'Nabumetone''s active metabolite, 6-MNA, is an inhibitor of both COX-1 and COX-2 although it exhibits some COX-2 selectivity.[label,A178903] Inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 reduces conversion of arachidonic acid to PGs and thromboxane (TXA<sub>2</sub>). This reduction in prostanoid production is the common mechanism that mediates the effects of nambutone.



PGE<sub>2</sub> is the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.[A179023] It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.[T116,A179023] PGE<sub>2</sub> activates the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled EP<sub>1</sub> receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE<sub>2</sub> also activates the EP<sub>4</sub> receptor, coupled to G<sub>s</sub>, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE<sub>2</sub> act via EP<sub>3</sub> to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP<sub>2</sub> to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI<sub>2</sub> is known to play a role via its G<sub>s</sub>-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.



PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP<sub>2</sub> receptors.[T116,A179044] Similarly to β adrenergic receptors these are G<sub>s</sub>-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE<sub>2</sub> also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.[T116] PGD<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP<sub>1</sub> receptor.[A179044] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.



PGE<sub>2</sub> can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory G<sub>q</sub> EP<sub>3</sub> receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.[T116] This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever. NSAIDs prevent the generation of PGE<sub>2</sub> thereby reducing the activity of these neurons.



The adverse effects of NSAIDs stem from the protective and regulatory roles of prostanoids which have been well-characterized.[T116] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> regulate blood flow to the kidney by similar mechanisms to the vasodilation they produce in inflammation. Prevention of this regulation by NSAIDs produces vasoconstriction which limits renal function by reducing blood flow and the hydrostatic pressure which drives filtration. PGE<sub>2</sub> also regulates gastric protection via EP<sub>3</sub> receptors which are, in this location, coupled to G<sub>i</sub> which inhibits the AC/PKA pathway. This reduces the secretion of protons by H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase in parietal cells and increases the secretion of mucus and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> by superficial endothelial cells. Disruption of this protective action by NSAIDs lead to ulceration of the gastric mucosa. Lastly, disruption of PGI<sub>2</sub>, which opposes platelet aggregation, generation by COX-2 selective agents leads to an imbalance with TXA<sub>2</sub> generated by COX-1, which promotes aggregation of platelets, leading to increased risk of thrombosis. Since nabumetone is somewhat COX-2 selective it is thought to promote this imbalance and increase thrombotic risk.[A178903]', 'NSAIDs, like nabumetone, are well established as analgesics. NSAIDs reduce both peripheral and central sensitization of nociceptive neurons due to inflammation which contribute to hyperalgesia and allodynia.[T116,A179023] This sensitization occurs through reducing the action potential threshold in peripheral neurons, reducing the intensity of painful stimuli needed to produce a painful sensation. Centrally, activation of dorsal horn neurons occurs along with increased release of glutamate, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and substance P which increase the transmission of painful stimuli. Coupled with this is an inhibition glycinergic neurons which normally inhibit pain transmission, a phenomenon known as disinhibition. Increased activity ofn-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors leads to the establishment of central sensitization, allowing both mild painful and innocuous stimuli to produce action potentials in nociceptive projection neurons. NSAIDs are effective in reducing mild-moderate acute and chronic nociceptive pain, however, the usefulness of NSAIDs in neuropathic pain is limited.



The anti-inflammatory effect of NSAIDs is mediated by preventing vasodilation, increases in vascular permeability, and the release of cytokines from endothelial cells.[T116,A179044] These three effects together prevent immunocompetent cells from migrating to the site of injury thereby preventing additional damage and inflammation due to activation of the immune system at the site of damage. PGs also modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation, an activity which is thought to be of importance in arthritic conditions.



The anti-pyretic effect of NSAIDs is mediated through preventing increases in temperature by prostaglandins (PGs) via the hypothalamus.[T116] Activation of this process by other inflammatory mediators relies upon subsequent action by PGs, therefore NSAIDs are able to reduce fever due to these mediators as well.



The adverse effects of NSAIDs are related to their therapeutic effects.[T116] The same vasodilatory action which occurs in inflammation also serves to regulate blood flow to the kidneys through the afferent renal arteries. NSAIDs are widely known as nephrotoxic agents as the reduction in PGs produces vasoconstriction of these arteries resulting in reduced blood flow to the kidneys and a subsequent decline in renal function. Reductions in mucus and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> secretion in the stomach increases the risk of ulceration by limiting the protection mediated by PGs. Lastly, COX-2 selective agents like nabumetone can unbalance prothrombotic and antithrombotic prostanoid generation leading to increased platelet aggregation and increased risk of thrombosis.', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Pharyngitis/tonsillitis caused by _Streptococcus pyogenes_ as an alternative to first-line therapy in individuals who cannot use first-line therapy.', 'In order to replicate, bacteria require a specific process of protein synthesis, enabled by ribosomal proteins [A6505]. Azithromycin binds to the 23S rRNA of the bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit. It stops bacterial protein synthesis by inhibiting the transpeptidation/translocation step of protein synthesis and by inhibiting the assembly of the 50S ribosomal subunit [FDA label], [A14179]. This results in the control of various bacterial infections [A174193], [FDA label].   The strong affinity of macrolides, including azithromycin, for bacterial ribosomes, is consistent with their broad‐spectrum antibacterial activities [A174193].





Azithromycin is highly stable at a low pH, giving it a longer serum half-life and increasing its concentrations in tissues compared to erythromycin [A174175].

Off-label indications include atrial fibrillation and supraventricular tachycardia.[A189666,A189720,A189723,L11286]', 'Amiodarone is considered a class III anti-arrhythmic drug. It blocks potassium currents that cause repolarization of the heart muscle during the third phase of the cardiac action potential.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death and NSCLC accounts for 85% of lung cancer cases. From the cases of NSCLC, approximately 75% of the patients present a late diagnosis with metastatic and advanced disease which produces a survival rate of 5%.

The rate of removal of phosphate by dietary manipulation or by dialysis is insufficient. Dialysis patients absorb 40% to 80% of dietary phosphorus. Therefore, the fraction of dietary phosphate absorbed from the diet needs to be reduced by using phosphate binders in most renal failure patients on maintenance dialysis. Calcium acetate when taken with meals combines with dietary phosphate to form insoluble calcium phosphate which is excreted in the feces. Maintenance of serum phosphorus below 6.0 mg/dl is generally considered as a clinically acceptable outcome of treatment with phosphate binders.

As such, repaglinide is more effective at reducing postprandial blood glucose levels than fasting blood glucose levels and requires a longer duration of therapy (approximately one month) before decreases in fasting blood glucose are observed. The insulinotropic effects of repaglinide are highest at intermediate glucose levels (3 to 10 mmol/L) and it does not increase insulin release already stimulated by high glucose concentrations (greater than 15 mmol/L).

It is used to provide local anesthesia by nerve blockade at various sites in the body [F4349, L5930, L5948]. It does so by stabilizing the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action [F4349, L5930, L5948]. In particular, the lidocaine agent acts on sodium ion channels located on the internal surface of nerve cell membranes [F4349, L5930, L5948]. At these channels, neutral uncharged lidocaine molecules diffuse through neural sheaths into the axoplasm where they are subsequently ionized by joining with hydrogen ions [F4349, L5930, L5948]. The resultant lidocaine cations are then capable of reversibly binding the sodium channels from the inside, keeping them locked in an open state that prevents nerve depolarization [F4349, L5930, L5948]. As a result, with sufficient blockage, the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron will ultimately not depolarize and will thus fail to transmit an action potential [F4349, L5930, L5948]. This facilitates an anesthetic effect by not merely preventing pain signals from propagating to the brain but by aborting their generation in the first place [F4349, L5930, L5948].



In addition to blocking conduction in nerve axons in the peripheral nervous system, lidocaine has important effects on the central nervous system and cardiovascular system [F4349, L5930, L5948]. After absorption, lidocaine may cause stimulation of the CNS followed by depression and in the cardiovascular system, it acts primarily on the myocardium where it may produce decreases in electrical excitability, conduction rate, and force of contraction [F4349, L5930, L5948].', 'Excessive blood levels of lidocaine can cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure [F4349, L5930]. With central neural blockade these changes may be attributable to the block of autonomic fibers, a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system, and/or the beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating action of epinephrine when present [F4349, L5930]. The net effect is normally a modest hypotension when the recommended dosages are not exceeded [F4349, L5930].



In particular, such cardiac effects are likely associated with the principal effect that lidocaine elicits when it binds and blocks sodium channels, inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of electrical action potential impulses necessary to facilitate muscle contraction [F4349, L5930, L5948]. Subsequently, in cardiac myocytes, lidocaine can potentially block or otherwise slow the rise of cardiac action potentials and their associated cardiac myocyte contractions, resulting in possible effects like hypotension, bradycardia, myocardial depression, cardiac arrhythmias, and perhaps cardiac arrest or circulatory collapse [F4349, L5930, L5948].



Moreover, lidocaine possesses a dissociation constant (pKa) of 7.7 and is considered a weak base [L5948]. As a result, about 25% of lidocaine molecules will be un-ionized and available at the physiological pH of 7.4 to translocate inside nerve cells, which means lidocaine elicits an onset of action more rapidly than other local anesthetics that have higher pKa values [L5948]. This rapid onset of action is demonstrated in about one minute following intravenous injection and fifteen minutes following intramuscular injection [L5930]. The administered lidocaine subsequently spreads rapidly through the surrounding tissues and the anesthetic effect lasts approximately ten to twenty minutes when given intravenously and about sixty to ninety minutes after intramuscular injection [L5930].



Nevertheless, it appears that the efficacy of lidocaine may be minimized in the presence of inflammation [L5948]. This effect could be due to acidosis decreasing the amount of un-ionized lidocaine molecules, a more rapid reduction in lidocaine concentration as a result of increased blood flow, or potentially also because of increased production of inflammatory mediators like peroxynitrite that elicit direct actions on sodium channels [L5948].', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

These folic acid congeners are transported across cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis where they are needed to maintain normal erythropoiesis, synthesize purine and thymidylate nucleic acids, interconvert amino acids, methylate tRNA, and generate and use formate. Using vitamin B12 as a cofactor, folic acid can normalize high homocysteine levels by remethylation of homocysteine to methionine via methionine synthetase.', 'Folic acid is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin found in foods such as liver, kidney, yeast, and leafy, green vegetables. Also known as folate or Vitamin B9, folic acid is an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in DNA and RNA synthesis. More specifically, folic acid is required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. Folic acid is the precursor of tetrahydrofolic acid, which is involved as a cofactor for transformylation reactions in the biosynthesis of purines and thymidylates of nucleic acids. Impairment of thymidylate synthesis in patients with folic acid deficiency is thought to account for the defective deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis that leads to megaloblast formation and megaloblastic and macrocytic anemias. Folic acid is particularly important during phases of rapid cell division, such as infancy, pregnancy, and erythropoiesis, and plays a protective factor in the development of cancer. As humans are unable to synthesize folic acid endogenously, diet and supplementation is necessary to prevent deficiencies. In order to function properly within the body, folic acid must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted by anti-metabolite therapies such as [DB00563] as they function as DHFR inhibitors to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, and therefore prevent the formation of DHF and THF.

[L39095] Patients may experience ED due to a variety of causes including psychogenic, neurogenic, vasculogenic, iatrogenic, or endocrine. [A242392] These causes result in dysfunction of penile smooth muscle relaxation through either disrupted neuronal signaling or direct influence on smooth muscle cells. During sexual arousal, non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) neurons release nitric oxide (NO). Nitric oxide stimulates guanylate cyclase which converts guanosine triphosphate to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).[A242287, A242377] cGMP activates the cGMP-dependent kinase (PKG) in a signal cascade which activates K+ channels leading to inhibition of Ca2+ channels, inhibits platelet activation, and inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation while inducing apoptosis. This signal cascade is attenuated by PDE5 which breaks the phosphodiester bond of cGMP, converting it to GMP. Inhibition of PDE5 by tadalafil increases signaling via the PKG cascade which supports penile smooth muscle relaxation during sexual arousal by decreasing Ca2+ entry into smooth muscle cells. This smooth muscle relaxation allows blood to fill the corpus cavernosum thereby producing an erection.



In PAH, blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries is raised due to a variety of mechanisms stemming from endothelial dysfunction.[A242377] Decreased production of NO and prostacyclin reduce vasodilatory signaling while overproduction of endothelin-1 and thromboxane increase vasoconstriction. Inflammation, thromboses, and hypoxia later contribute to vascular remodeling which further reduces luminal size. The resultant increase in blood pressure reduces the capacity for gas exchange and increases afterload at the right ventricle, producing symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and dizziness as well as leading to right-sided heart failure. Tadalafil exerts its therapeutic effect in PAH through boosting NO-cGMP signaling to contribute to smooth muscle relaxation as with ED.



Lastly, tadalafil is used to treat BPH.[L39095] BPH produces urinary dysfunction through hyperproliferation of the epithelial and smooth muscle layers of the prostate.[A242382] The increased size of the prostate blocks urine flow through the urethra resulting in higher residual volumes due to incomplete emptying. Tadalafil does not appear to exert its benefit via smooth muscle relaxation of the prostate. It may instead exert its effect through a mix of increased oxygenation and decreased inflammation, which decreases tissue remodeling, and inhibition of cell proliferation through the cGMP cascade.



The decreased affinity for PDE6 compared to other PDE5 inhibitors may explain the decreased incidence of visual side effects as PDE6 is present in the eye and contributes to color vision.[L39100, L39105, A242287]', 'Tadalafil exerts a therapeutic effect in ED by increasing sexual stimulation-dependant smooth muscle relaxation in the penis, allowing the corpus cavernosum to fill with blood to produce an erection.[A242287, A242377] Smooth muscle relaxation in the pulmonary vasculature helps to produce vasodilation in PAH which reduces blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries.[A242377] In BPH, tadalafil may contribute to decreased smooth muscle cell proliferation which may reduce the size of the prostate and relieve the anatomical obstruction which produces urinary symptoms of BPH.[A242382] The decreased affinity of tadalafil for PDE6 compared to other PDE5 inhibitors may explain the reduced incidence of visual side effects.[L39100, L39105, A242287]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

It is well established that M3 receptors exist on the smooth muscle layer throughout the gut and acetylcholine (ACh) released from enteric nerve endings stimulates the contraction of smooth muscle through M3 receptors. The enzyme AChE hydrolyses the released ACh, inactivates it and thus inhibits the gastric motility leading to various digestive disorders. Besides ACh, dopamine is present in significant amounts in the gastrointestinal tract and has several inhibitory effects on gastrointestinal motility, including reduction of lower esophageal sphincter and intragastric pressure. These effects appear to result from suppression of ACh release from the myenteric motor neurons and are mediated by the D2 subtype of dopamine receptors. Itopride, by virtue of its dopamine D2 receptor antagonism, removes the inhibitory effects on Ach release. It also inhibits the enzyme AchE which prevents the degradation of ACh. The net effect is an increase in ACh concentration, which in turn, promotes gastric motility, increases the lower esophageal sphincter pressure, accelerates gastric emptying and improves gastro-duodenal coordination. This dual mode of action of Itopride is unique and different from the actions of other prokinetic agents available in the market.

Animal studies have shown that _ginkgo biloba_ works on several neurotransmitter pathways and brain structures. Flavones were shown to inhibit lipid peroxidation; inhibit the uptake of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine; and inhibit platelet aggregation.[A232404] Terpene lactones may also act as potent antagonists of the platelet-activating factor and may possess anti-ischemic and fibrinolytic effects.[A232379] They were also shown to downregulate adrenal peripheral benzodiazepine receptors and increase adrenocorticotropic hormone levels.[A232404] _Ginkgo biloba_ also reversibly inhibits monoamine oxidase A; and modestly inhibits anticholinesterase activity,[A232379, A232389] leading to enhanced cholinergic transmission in the brain.[A232394]

Some clinical studies of dementia that were up to one year long showed that EGb improves the cognitive performance and social functioning of patients. However, other studies did not support its clinical benefit for patients with cognitive impairment and dementia. Numerous meta-analysis studies showed insufficient evidence of the effectiveness of EGb in reducing both all-cause dementia incidence and Alzheimer''s disease-associated dementia incidence in elderly patients with normal cognition or with mild cognitive impairment. Additionally, there is no up-to-date evidence that demonstrates the benefit of the long-term use of standardized EGb in reducing the risk of progression to Alzheimer''s disease. A 2012 meta-analysis did not support the use of EGb in enhancing cognitive function in healthy adults.[A232379]



In the context of cardiovascular diseases, a limited number of studies showed that EGb improved mortality or neurological recovery in the post-stroke period, reduced cognitive and neurological impairment after acute ischemic stroke, and improved blood flow in the coronary artery in patients with coronary artery disease. However, a systemic review found no statistical or clinically significant benefit of EGb for patients with peripheral arterial disease or hypertension. Overall, there is a lack of strong evidence in the use of EGb for the treatment or prevention of cardiovascular diseases.[A232379]



In a small trial, the use of EGb as an adjunctive treatment with citalopram improved depressive symptoms and cognitive function in patients with depression.[A232379] _Ginkgo biloba_ was also investigated as a potential treatment for antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction.[A2434] Another study showed EGb improving the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia.

In non-diabetic individuals, a basal level of insulin is supplemented with insulin spikes following meals. Increased insulin secretion following meals is responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to absorptive state. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. Insulin also promotes growth and is required for the actions of growth hormone (e.g. protein synthesis, cell division, DNA synthesis). Insulin lispro is a rapid-acting insulin analogue used to mimic postprandial insulin spikes in diabetic individuals. The onset of action of insulin lispro is 10-15 minutes. Its activity peaks 60 minutes following subcutaneous injection and its duration of action is 4-5 hours.

', '**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].



Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].



In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].



There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].



Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].



The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. 



In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].



In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].



The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].', 'Zinc is involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of human proteins may bind zinc, in addition to hundreds of proteins that transport and traffic zinc. It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is an essential element for a proper sense of taste and smell and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations [L2211].



Studies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions [L2095]:



**Colds:** Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently [L2095].



**Wound healing:** Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements [L2095].

PGE<sub>2</sub> is the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.[A179023] It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.[T116,A179023] PGE<sub>2</sub> activates the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled EP<sub>1</sub> receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE<sub>2</sub> also activates the EP<sub>4</sub> receptor, coupled to G<sub>s</sub>, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE<sub>2</sub> act via EP<sub>3</sub> to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP<sub>2</sub> to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI<sub>2</sub> is known to play a role via its G<sub>s</sub>-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.



PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP<sub>2</sub> receptors.[T116,A179044] Similarly to β adrenergic receptors these are G<sub>s</sub>-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE<sub>2</sub> also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.[T116] PGD<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP<sub>1</sub> receptor.[A179044] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.



PGE<sub>2</sub> can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory G<sub>q</sub> EP<sub>3</sub> receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.[T116] This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever. NSAIDs prevent the generation of PGE<sub>2</sub> thereby reducing the activity of these neurons.

8) Management of alcohol withdrawal.[A178174,A178177]', 'Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker, called such because it selectively binds to the β1-adrenergic receptor as an antagonist up to a reported 26 fold more than β2 receptors.[A178372] Selective activity at the β1 receptor produces cardioselectivity due to the higher population of this receptor in cardiac tissue. Some binding to β2 and possibly β3 receptors can still occur at therapeutic dosages but the effects mediated by antagonizing these are significantly reduced from those of non-selective agents. β1 and β2 receptors are G<sub>s</sub> coupled therefore antagonism of their activation reduces activity of adenylyl cyclase and its downstream signalling via cyclic adenosime monophosphate and protein kinase A (PKA). 



In cardiomyocytes PKA is thought to mediate activation of L-type calcium channels and ryanodine receptors through their phosphorylation.[A178396] L-type calcium channels can then provide an initial rise in intracellular calcium and trigger the ryanodine receptors to release calcium stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and increased contractility. PKA also plays a role in the cessation of contraction by phosphorylating phospholamban which in turn increases the affinity of SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase to increase reuptake of calcium into the SR. It also phophorylates troponin I to reduce affinity of the protein for calcium. Both of these events lead to a reduction in contraction which, when coupled with the initial increase in contraction, allows for faster cycling and consequently higher heart rate with increased contractility. L-type calcium channels are also a major contributor to cardiac depolarization and their activation can increase frequency of action potentials and possibly the incidence of ectopic potentials.[A178405] 



Similar inihibitory events occur in the bronchial smooth muscle to mediate relaxation including phosphorylation of myosin light-chain kinase, reducing its affinity for calcium.[A178408] PKA also inhibits the excitatory G<sub>q</sub> coupled pathway by phosphorylating the inositol trisphosphate receptor and phospholipase C resulting in inhibition of intracellular calcium release. Antagonism of this activity by beta-blocker agents like atenolol can thus cause increased bronchoconstriction.

', 'Atenolol is a cardio-selective beta-blocker and as such exerts most of its effects on the heart.[label] It acts as an antagonist to sympathetic innervation and prevents increases in heart rate, electrical conductivity, and contractility in the heart due to increased release of norepinephrine from the peripheral nervous system.[label,T116,A178258] Together the decreases in contractility and rate produce a reduction in cardiac output resulting in a compensatory increase in peripheral vascular resistance in the short-term. This response later declines to baseline with long-term use of atenolol. More importantly, this reduction in the work demanded of the myocardium also reduces oxygen demand which provides therapeutic benefit by reducing the mismatch of oxygen supply and demand in settings where coronary blood flow is limited, such as in coronary atherosclerosis. Reducing oxygen demand, particularly due to exercise, can reduce the frequency of angina pectoris symptoms and potentially improve survival of the remaining myocardium after myocardial infarction. The decrease in rate of sinoatrial node potentials, electrical conduction, slowing of potentials traveling through the atrioventricular node, and reduced frequency of ectopic potentials due to blockade of adrenergic beta receptors has led to benefit in arrhythmic conditions such as atrial fibrillation by controlling the rate of action potential generation and allowing for more effective coordinated contractions. Since a degree of sympathetic activity is necessary to maintain cardiac function, the reduced contractility induced by atenolol may precipitate or worsen heart failure, especially during volume overload.[label]



The effects of atenolol on blood pressure have been established, although it is less effective than alternative beta-blockers, but the mechanism has not yet been characterized.[label,T116] As a β1 selective drug, it does not act via the vasodilation produced by non-selective agents.[T116] Despite this there is a sustained reduction in peripheral vascular resistance, and consequently blood pressure, alongside a decrease in cardiac output. It is thought that atenolol''s antihypertensive activity may be related to action on the central nervous system (CNS) or it''s inhibition of the renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system rather than direct effects on the vasculature.[label]



Atenolol produces CNS effects similar to other beta-blockers, but does so to a lesser extent due to reduces ability to cross the blood-brain barrier.[T116] It has the potential to produce fatigue, depression, and sleep disturbances such as nightmares or insomnia.[label,T116] The exact mechanisms behind these have not been characterized but their occurrence must be considered as they represent clinically relevant adverse effects.



Atenolol exerts some effects on the respiratory system although to a much lesser extent than non-selective beta-blockers.[label] Interaction with β2 receptors in the airways can produce bronchoconstriction by blocking the relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle mediated by the sympathetic nervous system.[T116] The same action can interfere with β-agonist therapies used in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.[label,A178258,T116]

The retention of phosphate plays a pivotal role in causing secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with osteodystrophy, and soft-tissue calcification. The mechanism by which phosphate retention leads to hyperparathyroidism is not clearly delineated. Therapeutic efforts directed toward the control of hyperphosphatemia include reduction in the dietary intake of phosphate, inhibition of absorption of phosphate in the intestine with phosphate binders, and removal of phosphate from the body by more efficient methods of dialysis. The rate of removal of phosphate by dietary manipulation or by dialysis is insufficient. Dialysis patients absorb 40% to 80% of dietary phosphorus. Therefore, the fraction of dietary phosphate absorbed from the diet needs to be reduced by using phosphate binders in most renal failure patients on maintenance dialysis.

Lenalidomide exerts immunomodulating effects by altering cytokine production, regulating T cell co-stimulation, and enhancing the NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity.[A228543] Lenalidomide directly inhibits the cullin ring E3 ubiquitin ligase complex: upon binding to cereblon, a substrate adaptor of the complex, lenalidomide modulates substrate specificity of the complex to recruit substrate proteins of the ligase, including Ikaros (IKZF1), Aiolos (IKZF3), and CK1α.[L16028] These substrates are then tagged for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. IKZF1 and IKZF3 are B-cell transcription factors that are essential for B-cell differentiation and survival of malignant cells. IKZF3 also regulates the expression of interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), which is a transcription factor that regulates the aberrant myeloma-specific gene. The immunomodulatory actions of lenalidomide can be partly explained by the degradation of IKZF3, since it is a repressor of the interleukin 2 gene (IL2): as lenalidomide decreases the level of IKZF3, the production of IL-2 increases, thereby increasing the proliferation of natural killer (NK), NKT cells, and CD4+ T cells.[A228703] Lenalidomide inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-12, while elevating the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.[A228543] Lenalidomide acts as a T-cell co-stimulatory molecule that promotes CD3 T-cell proliferation and increases the production of IL-2 and IFN-γ in T lymphocytes, which enhances NK cell cytotoxicity and ADCC. It inhibits the expression and function of T-regulatory cells, which are often overabundant in some hematological malignancies.[A228708] 



Lenalidomide directly exerts antitumour effects by inhibiting the proliferation and inducing apoptosis of tumour cells. Lenalidomide triggers the activation of pro-apoptotic caspase-8, enhances tumour cell sensitivity to FAS-induced apoptosis, and downregulates NF-κB, an anti-apoptotic protein.[A228708] Independent of its immunomodulatory effects, lenalidomide mediates anti-angiogenic effects by inhibiting angiogenic growth factors released by tumour cells, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblastic-growth factor (BFGF), and hepatocyte-growth factor. _In vitro_, lenalidomide inhibits cell adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1, LFA-1, β2 and β3 integrins, as well as gap-junction function, thereby preventing metastasis of malignant cells.[A228708] ', 'In hematological malignancies, the immune system is deregulated in the form of altered cytokine networks in the tumour microenvironment, defective T cell regulation of host-tumour immune interactions, and diminished NK cell activity.[A228543] Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent with antineoplastic, antiangiogenic, and anti-inflammatory properties.[A228628] Lenalidomide exerts direct cytotoxicity by increasing apoptosis and inhibiting the proliferation of hematopoietic malignant cells.[A228708] It delays tumour growth in nonclinical hematopoietic tumour models _in vivo_, including multiple myeloma.[L16028] Lenalidomide also works to limit the invasion or metastasis of tumour cells and inhibits angiogenesis.[A228708]



Lenalidomide also mediates indirect antitumour effects via its immunomodulatory actions: it inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are implicated in various hematologic malignancies. Lenalidomide enhances the host immunity by stimulating T cell proliferation and enhancing the activity of natural killer (NK) cells.[A713, A228703, A228708] Lenalidomide is about 100–1000 times more potent in stimulating T cell proliferation than [thalidomide].[A228543] _In vitro_, it enhances antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), which is even more pronounced when used in combination with rituximab.[L16028] Due to its anti-inflammatory properties, lenalidomide has been investigated in the context of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[A229418] ', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Candesartan confers blood pressure lowering effects by antagonizing the hypertensive effects of angiotensin II via the RAAS. RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. Renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is cleaved by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II increases blood pressure by increasing total peripheral resistance, increasing sodium and water reabsorption in the kidneys via aldosterone secretion, and altering cardiovascular structure. Angiotensin II binds to two receptors: type-1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1) and type-2 angiotensin II receptor (AT2). AT1 is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that mediates the vasoconstrictive and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II. Studies performed in recent years suggest that AT2 antagonizes AT1-mediated effects and directly affects long-term blood pressure control by inducing vasorelaxation and increasing urinary sodium excretion. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are non-peptide competitive inhibitors of AT1. ARBs block the ability of angiotensin II to stimulate pressor and cell proliferative effects.

Such interaction has been reported in a study that investigated the effects of neuronal outgrowth induced by beta amyloid peptides; while amyloid peptides cause lipid disorganization within the cell membranes leading to neuronal death, piracetam demonstrated to decrease the destabilizing effects of amyloid peptide [A31534]. The authors suggest that piracetam induces a positive curvature of the membrane by occupying the polar groups in the phospholipids to counteract the negative curvature induced by amyloid peptides , which in turn would decrease the likelihood of membrane fusion [A31532]. This mechanism of action is thought to improve membrane stability, allowing the membrane and transmembrane proteins to maintain and recover the three-dimensional structure or folding for normal function [L1124] such as membrane transport, chemical secretion, and receptor binding and stimulation [A31532]. 



Through restored membrane fluidity, piracetam promotes restored neurotransmission such as glutamatergic and cholinergic systems, enhances neuroplasticity and mediates neuroprotective and anticonvulsant effects at the neuronal level [A31532]. It is also demonstrated that piracetam also improves the fluidity of platelet membranes. At the vascular level, piracetam decreases adhesion of erythrocytes to cell wall and reduces vasospasm which in turn improves microcirculation including cerebral and renal blood flow [A31532]. ', 'Piracetam is known to mediate various pharmacodynamic actions:



**Neuronal effects**: 



Piracetam modulates the cholinergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic, and glutamatergic neurotransmission although the drug does not display high affinity to any of the associated receptors (Ki >10μM). Instead, piracetam increases the density of postsynaptic receptors and/or restore the function of these receptors through stabilizing the membrane fluidity [A31532]. In the forebrain of aging mice, the density of NMDA receptors was increased by approximately 20% following 14 days of piracetam treatment. Based on the findings of various animal and human studies, the cognitive processses including learning, memory, attention and consciousness were enhanced from piracetam therapy without inducing sedation and psychostimulant effects [L1125]. Piracetam mediate neuroprotective effects against hypoxia-induced damage, intoxication, and electroconvulsive therapy [L1125]. 



In two studies involving alcohol-treated rats with evidences of withdrawal-related neuronal loss, piracetam was shown to reduce the extent of neuronal loss and increase the numbers of synapses in the hippocampus by up to 20% relative to alcohol-treated or alcohol-withdrawn rats [A31532]. This suggests that piracetam is capable in promoting neuroplasticity when recoverable neural circuits are present [A31532]. Although the mechanism of action is not fully understood, administration of piracetam prior to a convulsant stimulus reduces the seizure severity and enhances the anticonvulsant effectiveness of conventional antiepileptics such as carbamazepine and diazepam [A31535]. 



**Vascular effects**: 



Piracetam is shown to increase the deformability of erythrocytes, reduce platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent manner, reduce the adhesion of erythrocytes to vascular endothelium and capillary vasospasm. In healthy volunteers, piracetam mediated a direct stimulant effect on prostacycline synthesis and reduced the plasma levels of fibrinogen and von Willebrand’s factors (VIII: C; VIII R: AG; VIII R: vW) by 30 to 40% [L1125].

In the treatment of head lice dimethicone 100, the respiratory systems of head lice are targeted.  NYDA works by suffocating the lice, nymphs and the embryos. The physical properties of this drug, including the viscosity and spreading property of the solution allow it to easily flow into the respiratory system of all developmental stages of the insect,  causing suffocation and death of the organisms. It diffuses through the stigmata (spiracles) of the lice, into the tracheae of the head lice as well as through the aeropyles of the egg operculum. The solution then displaces oxygen. The low viscosity, volatile dimethicone enables the NYDA head lice solution to penetrate into the breathing system. Its evaporation causes the thickening of the NYDA solution. The remaining high viscosity dimethicone ultimately encloses the respiratory system and thus leading to suffocation of all stages of head lice (adult lice, larvae and eggs). This mode of action prevents the development of lice resistance by preventing the formation of new progency [L1774].



Studies performed using house crickets and lice suggest a close correlation between the death of the lice and the influx of the solution into the insect head tracheae. These data strongly suggest that the total filling of the head tracheae immediately blocks the oxygen supply to the insect central nervous system. Death, following numerous stages of disability after the entrance of dimethicones into the abdominal tracheal system, demonstrates the sequence of oxygen deprivation.

Insulin binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor is able to autophosphorylate and phosphorylate numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1.

Tofacitinib is a partial and reversible janus kinase (JAK) inihibitor that will prevent the body from responding to cytokine signals. By inhibiting JAKs, tofacitinib prevents the phosphorylation and activation of STATs. The JAK-STAT signalling pathway is involved in the transcription of cells involved in hematopoiesis, and immune cell function.

Common known adverse effects of tofacitinib include headaches, diarrhea, nausea, nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection. More serious immunologic and hematological adverse effects have also been noted resulting in lymphopenia, neutropenia, anemia, and increased risk of cancer and infection. 



Before initiations of tofacitinib patients should be tested for latent infections of tuberculosis, and should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of infection (fungal, viral, bacterial, or mycobacterial) during therapy.

In particular, it has been documented that montelukast can cause bronchodilation as soon as within 2 hours of oral administration.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] This action can also be additive to the bronchodilation caused by the concomitant use of a beta agonist.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Nevertheless, clinical investigations performed with adults 15 years of age and older revealed that no additional clinical benefit is obtained when doses of montelukast greater than 10 mg a day are used.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]



Additionally, in clinical trials with adults and pediatric asthmatic patients aged 6 to 14 years, it was also determined that montelukast can reduce mean peripheral blood eosinophils by about 13% to 15% from baseline in comparison to placebo during double-blind treatment periods.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] At the same time, in patients aged 15 years and older who were experiencing seasonal allergic rhinitis, the use of montelukast caused a median reduction of 13% in peripheral blood eosinophil counts when compared to placebo as well.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Pertuzumab targets the extracellular dimerization domain (subdomain II) of HER2, thereby inhibiting ligand-initiated intracellular signaling via the MAP kinase and PI3K pathways.

It reversibly competes against nitrendipine and other DHP CCBs for DHP binding sites in vascular smooth muscle and cultured rabbit atrial cells. Calcium ions entering the cell through these channels bind to calmodulin. Calcium-bound calmodulin then binds to and activates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Activated MLCK catalyzes the phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain subunit of myosin, a key step in muscle contraction. Signal amplification is achieved by calcium-induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through ryanodine receptors. Inhibition of the initial influx of calcium decreases the contractile activity of arterial smooth muscle cells and results in vasodilation. The vasodilatory effects of felodipine result in an overall decrease in blood pressure. Felodipine may be used to treat mild to moderate essential hypertension.', 'Felodipine belongs to the dihydropyridine (DHP) class of calcium channel blockers (CCBs), the most widely used class of CCBs. There are at least five different types of calcium channels in Homo sapiens: L-, N-, P/Q-, R- and T-type. It was widely accepted that CCBs target L-type calcium channels, the major channel in muscle cells that mediates contraction; however, some studies have shown that felodipine also binds to and inhibits T-type calcium channels. T-type calcium channels are most commonly found on neurons, cells with pacemaker activity and on osteocytes. The pharmacologic significance of T-type calcium channel blockade is unknown. Felodipine also binds to calmodulin and inhibits calmodulin-dependent calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The effect of this interaction appears to be minor.  Another study demonstrated that felodipine attenuates the activity of calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (CaMPDE) by binding to the PDE-1B1 and PDE-1A2 enzyme subunits. CaMPDE is one of the key enzymes involved in cyclic nucleotides and calcium second messenger systems. Felodipine also acts as an antagonist to the mineralcorticoid receptor by competing with aldosterone for binding and blocking aldosterone-induced coactivator recruitment of the mineralcorticoid receptor. Felodipine is able to bind to skeletal and cardiac muscle isoforms of troponin C, one of the key regulatory proteins in muscle contraction. Though felodipine exhibits binding to many endogenous molecules, its vasodilatory effects are still thought to be brought about primarily through inhibition of voltage-gated L-type calcium channels. Similar to other DHP CCBs, felodipine binds directly to inactive calcium channels stabilizing their inactive conformation. Since arterial smooth muscle depolarizations are longer in duration than cardiac muscle depolarizations, inactive channels are more prevalent in smooth muscle cells. Alternative splicing of the alpha-1 subunit of the channel gives felodipine additional arterial selectivity. At therapeutic sub-toxic concentrations, felodipine has little effect on cardiac myocytes and conduction cells.', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Cineol containing preparations of eucalyptus oil may contain up to 80% (or more) 1,8-cineole [A32243] and is one of the most common types of eucalyptus oil formulations used. As an active agent indicated for relieving certain cold symptoms and/or certain muscular sprains and cramps, it is believed that eucalyptus oil may possess some antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities.



Some in vitro studies of human blood monocytes suggest a dose-dependent effect of eucalyptus oil to elicit significant inhibition of multiple cytokines, perhaps in the treatment of airway inflammation [A32244, A32245]. Moreover, other studies in animal models discuss the possibility of eucalyptus oil demonstrating anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects that potentially account for inhibiting the formation of prostaglandins and cytokines by stimulated monocytes in vitro [A32246, A32247].

The retention of phosphate plays a pivotal role in causing secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with osteodystrophy, and soft-tissue calcification. The mechanism by which phosphate retention leads to hyperparathyroidism is not clearly delineated. Therapeutic efforts directed toward the control of hyperphosphatemia include reduction in the dietary intake of phosphate, inhibition of absorption of phosphate in the intestine with phosphate binders, and removal of phosphate from the body by more efficient methods of dialysis. The rate of removal of phosphate by dietary manipulation or by dialysis is insufficient. Dialysis patients absorb 40% to 80% of dietary phosphorus. Therefore, the fraction of dietary phosphate absorbed from the diet needs to be reduced by using phosphate binders in most renal failure patients on maintenance dialysis. Calcium acetate when taken with meals combines with dietary phosphate to form insoluble calcium phosphate which is excreted in the feces. Maintenance of serum phosphorus below 6.0 mg/dl is generally considered as a clinically acceptable outcome of treatment with phosphate binders.

Empagliflozin is not approved for use in patients with type 1 diabetes.', 'The vast majority of glucose filtered through the glomerulus is reabsorbed within the proximal tubule, primarily via SGLT2 (sodium-glucose linked co-transporter-2) which is responsible for ~90% of the total glucose reabsorption within the kidneys. Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase on the basolateral membrane of proximal tubular cells utilize ATP to actively pump Na+ ions into the interstitium surrounding the tubule, establishing a Na<sup>+</sup> gradient within the tubular cell. SGLT2 on the apical membrane of these cells then utilize this gradient to facilitate secondary active co-transport of both Na+ and glucose out of the filtrate, thereby reabsorbing glucose back into the blood – inhibiting this co-transport, then, allows for a marked increase in glucosuria and decrease in blood glucose levels.[A203453] Empagliflozin is a potent inhibitor of renal SGLT2 transporters located in the proximal tubules of the kidneys and works to lower blood glucose levels via an increase in glucosuria.[L13688]



Empagliflozin also appears to exert cardiovascular benefits - specifically in the prevention of heart failure - independent of its blood glucose-lowering effects, though the exact mechanism of this benefit is not precisely understood. Several theories have been posited, including the potential inhibition of Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger (NHE) 1 in the myocardium and NHE3 in the proximal tubule, reduction of pre-load via diuretic/natriuretic effects and reduction of blood pressure, prevention of cardiac fibrosis via suppression of pro-fibrotic markers, and reduction of pro-inflammatory adipokines.[A203456]', 'Empagliflozin lowers blood glucose levels by preventing glucose reabsorption in the kidneys, thereby increasing the amount of glucose excreted in the urine.[L13688] It has a relatively long duration of action requiring only once-daily dosing.

PGE<sub>2</sub> is the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.[A179023] It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.[T116,A179023] PGE<sub>2</sub> activates the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled EP<sub>1</sub> receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE<sub>2</sub> also activates the EP<sub>4</sub> receptor, coupled to G<sub>s</sub>, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE<sub>2</sub> act via EP<sub>3</sub> to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP<sub>2</sub> to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI<sub>2</sub> is known to play a role via its G<sub>s</sub>-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.



PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP<sub>2</sub> receptors.[T116,A179044] Similarly to β adrenergic receptors these are G<sub>s</sub>-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE<sub>2</sub> also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.[T116] PGD<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP<sub>1</sub> receptor.[A179044] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.



PGE<sub>2</sub> can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory G<sub>q</sub> EP<sub>3</sub> receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.[T116] This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever. NSAIDs prevent the generation of PGE<sub>2</sub> thereby reducing the activity of these neurons.

In addition, this drug also inhibits the glutathione-S-transferase (a major detoxifying enzyme) and modulates the Avr-14 gene, encoding for the alpha-type subunit of glutamate-gated chloride ion channel present in nematodes. Aside from its well understood non-competitive inhibition of the PFOR in anaerobic bacteria, NTZ also demonstrates various other antibacterial mechanisms. It inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase in E Coli, disrupts the membrane potential and pH homeostasis in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis, suppresses the chaperone/usher (CU) pathway of the gram-negative bacteria,  and stimulates host macrophage autophagy in tuberculosis patients [A31976]. NTZ also suppresses viral replication by inhibiting the maturation of the viral hemagglutinin and the viral transcription factor immediate early 2 (IE2) as well as by activating the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (an antiviral intracellular protein). Lastly, NTZ exhibits an inhibitory effect on tumor cell progression by altering drug detoxification (glutathione-S-transferase P1), unfolded protein response, autophagy, anti-cytokines activity, and c-Myc inhibition [A31976].', 'The general effect of this medication is the prevention of microbe activity through disruption of important energy pathways for survival and proliferation [FDA label, A31976].

Under EMA approval, such fish oil pharmaceuticals comprised of virtually the same fish and fish oil derived omega-3-fatty acids EPA and DHA are indicated specifically for (a) adjuvant treatment in secondary prevention after myocardial infarction, in addition to other standard therapy (ie. statins, antiplatelet medicinal products, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors), and (b) as a supplement to diet when dietary measures alone are insufficient to produce an adequate response, particularly with type IV hypertriglyceridemia in monotherapy or type IIb/III in combination with statins, when control of triglycerides is insufficient [L2661]. In addition, prescribing information for EMA approved fish oil pharmaceuticals are also indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce very high (>=500 mg/dL) triglyceride levels in adult patients, much like similar FDA approved indications [F37, FDA Label].', 'The specific mechanism of action by which the fish oil EPA and DHA acids are capable of reducing serum triglyceride levels is not yet fully understood [FDA Label, A32933]. Nevertheless, it is proposed that such omega-3-fatty acids may not be the preferred substrates of the enzyme diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase that participates in the generation of triglycerides; that  they might interact with nuclear transcription factors that manage lipogenesis; or that their presence and increase in levels can cause cellular metabolism to subsequently shift toward a decrease in triglyceride synthesis and an increase in fatty acid oxidation [A32933]. Moreover, the EPA and DHA acids are also believed to be able to promote apolipoprotein B degradation in the liver through the stimulation of an autophagic process [A32933]. It may also be possible that these fish oil acids can accelerate the clearance of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles and chylomicron [A32933]. The combination of all these actions results in fewer VLDL particles being assembled and secreted, which is of considerable importance as VLDL particles are the major endogenous source of triglycerides [A32933].



Moreover, new paradigms of how inflammation is contained and dissipated involve various newly discovered chemical mediators, resolvins, and protectins [A32933]. Such agents are believed to be directly involved in blocking neutrophil migration, infiltration, recruitment, as well as blocking T-cell migration and promoting T-cell apoptosis [A32933]. Additionally, such protectins can also reduce tumor necrosis factor and interferon secretion [A32933]. Of particular importance, however, is the fact that protectins and resolvins are exclusively derived from omega-3-fatty acids and that EPA is the substrate of the resolvins family and DHA can be converted to both resolvins and protectins [A32933]. It is believed that these effects of such fish oil acids underlie the actions that fish oil have demonstrated on eliciting stability for vulnerable inflammatory plaques [A32933].



Finally, fish oil acids have demonstrated certain direct electrophysiological effects on the myocardium [A32933]. In animal studies, it was shown that the ventricular fibrillation threshold could be increased in both animals fed or infused with omega-3-fatty acids [A32933]. Further studies subsequently revealed that such fatty acids could reduce both sodium currents and L-type calcium currents on a cellular and ion channel level [A32933]. It is consequently hypothesized that during ischemia, a reduction in the sodium ion current protects hyperexcitable tissue, and a reduction in the calcium ion current could reduce arrhythmogenic depolarizing currents - and that perhaps the use of EPA and DHA fish oil acids could facilitate such activity [A32933]. For the time being, however, omega-3-fatty acids in pharmaceutical supplement form have not been shown to elicit such protection against heart conditions [L2662].', 'In general, the only practical method of obtaining and increasing the levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) fish oil omega-3-fatty acids in the body is to consume them directly from foods and/or dietary supplements [L784]. Having EPA and DHA is important because they facilitate numerous important functions in the human body. As an example, such supplementation of fish oil EPA and DHA demonstrates a legitimate ability to decrease triglyceride levels as their presence in the body can act as poor substrates for the enzymes that are ordinarily responsible for triglyceride synthesis and also inhibit the esterification of other fatty acids, among other mechanisms [FDA Label, L2661].



Moreover, such fish oil acids can become important components of the phospholipids that form the structures of cell membranes [L784]. Specifically, DHA is particularly high in the retina, brain, and sperm [L784]. Additionally, these acids also provide energy for the body and are used to form eicosanoids - signaling molecules that have similar chemical structures to the fish oil fatty acids from which they are derived [L784].

Moreover, there have also been studies demonstrating the capacity for lactulose to minimize the formation of gallstones and even some investigations regarding the experimental use of the agent in developing novel anticancer agents owing to its ability to bind galactin carbohydrates involved in various tumor progressions [L6202].', 'Lactulose is a synthetic disaccharide derivative of lactose that consists of one molecule of galactose and one molecule of fructose.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] Saccharolytic bacteria present in the large intestine subsequently break the substance down into organic acids like lactic acid and small amounts of formic and acetic acids.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] Such resultant volatile fatty acid metabolites, in combination with hydrogen and methane that is also generated consequently enhance intraluminal gas formation, peristaltic gut motility, and elicit an osmotic effect that facilitates an increase in the water content of stool as well as associated stool softening.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] All of these actions ultimately assist in facilitating and increasing the frequency of bowel movements in patients experiencing constipation, although it may take 24 to 48 hours after using the medication for this laxative effect to become evident.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]



At the same time, the formation of such acids via the metabolism of lactulose by colonic bacteria also acidifies the contents of the colon, thereby contributing to the treatment of portal-systemic encephalopathy (PSE).[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] As one of the principal features of PSE involves the accumulation of nitrogenous waste products like ammonia in the systemic circulation, a state in which the colonic contents become more acidic than blood allows ammonia in the circulation to diffuse into the colon.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]. Furthermore, ammonia that diffuses into the acidic colon is ionized to ammonium ions that are incapable of being absorbed back into the blood.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] These effects, combined with the laxative action of lactulose facilitates the excretion of excess ammonia.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] And finally, it is also believed that an acidic colonic environment results in the elimination of urease-producing bacteria that contribute to the formation of ammonia while surviving colonic bacteria use up any trapped ammonia in the colon as a source of nitrogen for protein synthesis.[L6202]', 'Lactulose formulations are most commonly administered via the oral route or the rectal route.[L6202] Consequently, because the substance experiences minimal absorption by the gut it typically remains localized in the gastrointestinal tract environment and ultimately demonstrates almost all of its pharmacologic effects within the gut.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] In particular, as lactulose elicits its laxative effects in enhancing stool amounts and softening stool, such biochemical and physiologic activities can cause increased bowel sounds (borborygmi), a feeling of bloatedness, belching, frequent flatus, and diarrhea.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]   ', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

(1) the treatment of erectile dysfunction [A175582, L5611, F3853, F3856, F3886]; and



(2) treatment of pulmonary hypertension, where:

a) the US FDA specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO Group I) in adults to improve exercise ability and delay clinical worsening [F3850]. The delay in clinical worsening was demonstrated when sildenafil was added to background epoprostenol therapy [F3850]. Studies establishing effectiveness were short-term (12 to 16 weeks), and included predominately patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class II-III symptoms and idiopathic etiology (71%) or associated with connective tissue disease (CTD) (25%) [F3850];



b) the Canadian product monograph specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of primary pulmonary arterial hypertension (PPH) or pulmonary hypertension secondary to connective tissue disease (CTD) in adult patients with WHO functional class II or III who have not responded to conventional therapy [F3859]. In addition, improvement in exercise ability and delay in clinical worsening was demonstrated in adult patients who were already stabilized on background epoprostenol therapy [F3859]; and



c) the EMA product information specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension classified as WHO functional class II and III, to improve exercise capacity [F3883]. Efficacy has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with connective tissue disease [F3883]. The EMA label also indicates sildenafil for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years old with pulmonary arterial hypertension [F3883]. Efficacy in terms of improvement of exercise capacity or pulmonary hemodynamics has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital heart disease [F3883].', 'Sildenafil is an oral therapy for erectile dysfunction [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. In the natural setting, i.e. with sexual stimulation, it restores impaired erectile function by increasing blood flow to the penis [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].



The physiological mechanism responsible for the erection of the penis involves the release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Nitric oxide then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].



Sildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in the corpus cavernosum, where PDE5 is responsible for degradation of cGMP [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Sildenafil has a peripheral site of action on erections [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum but potently enhances the relaxant effect of NO on this tissue [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. When the NO/cGMP pathway is activated, as occurs with sexual stimulation, inhibition of PDE5 by sildenafil results in increased corpus cavernosum levels of cGMP [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Therefore sexual stimulation is required in order for sildenafil to produce its intended beneficial pharmacological effects [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].



Moreover, apart from the presence of PDE5 in the corpus cavernosum of the penis, PDE5 is also present in the pulmonary vasculature [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614]. Sildenafil, therefore, increases cGMP within pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells resulting in relaxation [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614]. In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, this can lead to vasodilation of the pulmonary vascular bed and, to a lesser degree, vasodilatation in the systemic circulation [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614].', 'In vitro studies have shown that sildenafil is selective for phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Its effect is more potent on PDE5 than on other known phosphodiesterases [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. In particular, there is a 10-times selectivity over PDE6 which is involved in the phototransduction pathway in the retina [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. There is an 80-times selectivity over PDE1, and over 700-times over PDE 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. And finally, sildenafil has greater than 4,000-times selectivity for PDE5 over PDE3, the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase isoform involved in the control of cardiac contractility [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



In eight double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies of patients with either organic or psychogenic erectile dysfunction, sexual stimulation resulted in improved erections, as assessed by an objective measurement of hardness and duration of erections (via the use of RigiScan®), after sildenafil administration compared with placebo [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Most studies assessed the efficacy of sildenafil approximately 60 minutes post-dose [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The erectile response, as assessed by RigiScan®, generally increased with increasing sildenafil dose and plasma concentration [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The time course of effect was examined in one study, showing an effect for up to 4 hours but the response was diminished compared to 2 hours [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



Sildenafil causes mild and transient decreases in systemic blood pressure which, in the majority of cases, do not translate into clinical effects [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg, three times a day to patients with systemic hypertension the mean change from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was a decrease of 9.4 mmHg and 9.1 mmHg respectively [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg, three times a day to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension lesser effects in blood pressure reduction were observed (a reduction in both systolic and diastolic pressure of 2 mmHg)[F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614] . At the recommended dose of 20 mg three times a day no reductions in systolic or diastolic pressure were seen [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



Single oral doses of sildenafil up to 100 mg in healthy volunteers produced no clinically relevant effects on ECG [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg three times a day to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension no clinically relevant effects on the ECG were reported either [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



In a study of the hemodynamic effects of a single oral 100 mg dose of sildenafil in 14 patients with severe coronary artery disease (CAD) (> 70 % stenosis of at least one coronary artery), the mean resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased by 7 % and 6 % respectively compared to baseline [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Mean pulmonary systolic blood pressure decreased by 9% [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Sildenafil showed no effect on cardiac output and did not impair blood flow through the stenosed coronary arteries [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



Mild and transient differences in color discrimination (blue/green) were detected in some subjects using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test at 1 hour following a 100 mg dose, with no effects evident after 2 hours post-dose [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The postulated mechanism for this change in color discrimination is related to inhibition of PDE6, which is involved in the phototransduction cascade of the retina [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Sildenafil has no effect on visual acuity or contrast sensitivity. In a small size placebo-controlled study of patients with documented early age-related macular degeneration (n = 9), sildenafil (single dose, 100 mg) demonstrated no significant changes in visual tests conducted (which included visual acuity, Amsler grid, color discrimination simulated traffic light, and the Humphrey perimeter and photostress test) [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

[T116] ', 'Ramipril inhibits the RAAS system by binding to and inhibiting ACE thereby preventing the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. [T116] As plasma levels of angiotensin II fall, less activation of the G-protein coupled receptors angiotensin receptor I (AT<sub>1</sub>R) and angiotensin receptor II (AT<sub>2</sub>R) occurs. 



AT<sub>1</sub>R mediates vasoconstriction, inflammation, fibrosis, and oxidative stress through a variety of signaling pathways. [T116] These include G<sub>q</sub> coupling to the inositol triphosphate pathway, activation of phospholipases C, A<sub>2</sub>, and D which contribute to eicosanoid production, activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and MAP kinases, G<sub>i</sub> and G<sub>12/13</sub>, and eventual activation of the Jak/STAT pathway leading to cell growth and production of extracellular matrix components. AT<sub>1</sub>R activation also leads to increased activity of membrane-bound NADH/NADPH oxidase which contributes to production of reactive oxygen species. Decreased activation of this receptor mediates the renoprotective, antihypertensive, and cardioprotective effects of ramipril by reducing inflammation and vasoconstriction.



AT<sub>2</sub>R acts in opposition to the effects of AT<sub>1</sub>R by activating phosphotyrosine phosphatases which inhibit MAP kinases, inhibiting Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel opening, and stimulating cGMP and nitric oxide production leading to vasodilation. [T116] These counteracting effects are shared by the Mas receptor which is activated by Ang(1-7), a subtype of angiotensin produced by plasma esterases from AngI or by ACE2 from AngII produced through a secondary pathway by tonin and cathepsin G. Ang(1-7) also activates AT<sub>2</sub>R although the bulk of its effect is mediated by MasR.



ACE is also responsible for the breakdown of bradykinin. [T116] The resulting buildup of bradykinin due to ACE inhibition is thought to mediate the characteristic dry-cough as a side effect of ACE inhibitor medications.



', 'Ramipril is an ACE inhibitor similar to benazepril, fosinopril and quinapril. [T116] It is an inactive prodrug that is converted to ramiprilat in the liver, the main site of activation, and kidneys. Ramiprilat confers blood pressure lowing effects by antagonizing the effect of the RAAS. The RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from the granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. In the blood stream, renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to ATI, which is subsequently cleaved to ATII by ACE. ATII increases blood pressure using a number of mechanisms. First, it stimulates the secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone travels to the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and collecting tubule of nephrons where it increases sodium and water reabsorption by increasing the number of sodium channels and sodium-potassium ATPases on cell membranes. Second, ATII stimulates the secretion of vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone or ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland. ADH stimulates further water reabsorption from the kidneys via insertion of aquaporin-2 channels on the apical surface of cells of the DCT and collecting tubules. Third, ATII increases blood pressure through direct arterial vasoconstriction. Stimulation of the Type 1 ATII receptor on vascular smooth muscle cells leads to a cascade of events resulting in myocyte contraction and vasoconstriction. In addition to these major effects, ATII induces the thirst response via stimulation of hypothalamic neurons. ACE inhibitors inhibit the rapid conversion of ATI to ATII and antagonize RAAS-induced increases in blood pressure. ACE (also known as kininase II) is also involved in the enzymatic deactivation of bradykinin, a vasodilator. Inhibiting the deactivation of bradykinin increases bradykinin levels and may sustain the effects of ramiprilat by causing increased vasodilation and decreased blood pressure.', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

As neutrophils promote both the initiation and the maintenance of inflammation at sites of infection, suppressed neutrophil responses lead to extreme susceptibility to infection.[A35605] Low neutrophil levels, or neutropenia, caused by chronic neutropenia, myelosuppressive chemotherapy, and radiation therapy increases the risk of infection and related events.[A245868] Neutropenia caused by chemotherapy or radiation therapy can further progress into febrile neutropenia, which is associated with an elevated risk for life-threatening systemic infections and chemotherapy-associated morbidity and mortality.[A35591]



The production and release of functional neutrophils from the bone marrow are normally regulated by granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF), which are major cytokine regulators of neutrophilic granulocytes.[A35605] G-CSFs act on hematopoietic cells by binding to specific cell surface receptors to stimulate the proliferation‚ differentiation‚ and maturation of neutrophil progenitors. G-CSF also induces some end-cell functional activation of neutrophils, including enhanced phagocytic ability‚ priming of the cellular metabolism associated with respiratory burst‚ antibody-dependent killing, and the increased expression of some cell surface antigens.[L40714]  Filgrastim is a short-acting recombinant G-CSF that mimics the biological actions of endogenous G-CSF. It also facilitates the release of neutrophils from the bone marrow into the blood to reduce the incidence of infection and manage neutropenia.[A245858, A245868]', 'Filgrastim is used to reduce the incidence, severity and duration of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia in patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy.

Filgrastim is also used to mobilize hematopoietic progenitor cells into the peripheral blood in order to reduce the risk for bleeding complications and the need for platelet transfusions.

By doing so, it inhibits acid secretion into the gsatric lumen. This effect is dose-related and leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus.



Esomeprazole is the s-isomer of [DB00338], which is a racemate of the S- and R-enantiomer. Esomeprazole has been shown to inhibit acid secretion to a similar extent as [DB00338], without any significant differences between the two compounds _in vitro_. 



PPIs such as esomeprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]



Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as esomeprazole has been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

These folic acid congeners are transported across cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis where they are needed to maintain normal erythropoiesis, synthesize purine and thymidylate nucleic acids, interconvert amino acids, methylate tRNA, and generate and use formate. Using vitamin B12 as a cofactor, folic acid can normalize high homocysteine levels by remethylation of homocysteine to methionine via methionine synthetase.', 'Folic acid is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin found in foods such as liver, kidney, yeast, and leafy, green vegetables. Also known as folate or Vitamin B9, folic acid is an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in DNA and RNA synthesis. More specifically, folic acid is required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. Folic acid is the precursor of tetrahydrofolic acid, which is involved as a cofactor for transformylation reactions in the biosynthesis of purines and thymidylates of nucleic acids. Impairment of thymidylate synthesis in patients with folic acid deficiency is thought to account for the defective deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis that leads to megaloblast formation and megaloblastic and macrocytic anemias. Folic acid is particularly important during phases of rapid cell division, such as infancy, pregnancy, and erythropoiesis, and plays a protective factor in the development of cancer. As humans are unable to synthesize folic acid endogenously, diet and supplementation is necessary to prevent deficiencies. In order to function properly within the body, folic acid must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted by anti-metabolite therapies such as [DB00563] as they function as DHFR inhibitors to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, and therefore prevent the formation of DHF and THF.

It is used to provide local anesthesia by nerve blockade at various sites in the body [F4349, L5930, L5948]. It does so by stabilizing the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action [F4349, L5930, L5948]. In particular, the lidocaine agent acts on sodium ion channels located on the internal surface of nerve cell membranes [F4349, L5930, L5948]. At these channels, neutral uncharged lidocaine molecules diffuse through neural sheaths into the axoplasm where they are subsequently ionized by joining with hydrogen ions [F4349, L5930, L5948]. The resultant lidocaine cations are then capable of reversibly binding the sodium channels from the inside, keeping them locked in an open state that prevents nerve depolarization [F4349, L5930, L5948]. As a result, with sufficient blockage, the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron will ultimately not depolarize and will thus fail to transmit an action potential [F4349, L5930, L5948]. This facilitates an anesthetic effect by not merely preventing pain signals from propagating to the brain but by aborting their generation in the first place [F4349, L5930, L5948].



In addition to blocking conduction in nerve axons in the peripheral nervous system, lidocaine has important effects on the central nervous system and cardiovascular system [F4349, L5930, L5948]. After absorption, lidocaine may cause stimulation of the CNS followed by depression and in the cardiovascular system, it acts primarily on the myocardium where it may produce decreases in electrical excitability, conduction rate, and force of contraction [F4349, L5930, L5948].', 'Excessive blood levels of lidocaine can cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure [F4349, L5930]. With central neural blockade these changes may be attributable to the block of autonomic fibers, a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system, and/or the beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating action of epinephrine when present [F4349, L5930]. The net effect is normally a modest hypotension when the recommended dosages are not exceeded [F4349, L5930].



In particular, such cardiac effects are likely associated with the principal effect that lidocaine elicits when it binds and blocks sodium channels, inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of electrical action potential impulses necessary to facilitate muscle contraction [F4349, L5930, L5948]. Subsequently, in cardiac myocytes, lidocaine can potentially block or otherwise slow the rise of cardiac action potentials and their associated cardiac myocyte contractions, resulting in possible effects like hypotension, bradycardia, myocardial depression, cardiac arrhythmias, and perhaps cardiac arrest or circulatory collapse [F4349, L5930, L5948].



Moreover, lidocaine possesses a dissociation constant (pKa) of 7.7 and is considered a weak base [L5948]. As a result, about 25% of lidocaine molecules will be un-ionized and available at the physiological pH of 7.4 to translocate inside nerve cells, which means lidocaine elicits an onset of action more rapidly than other local anesthetics that have higher pKa values [L5948]. This rapid onset of action is demonstrated in about one minute following intravenous injection and fifteen minutes following intramuscular injection [L5930]. The administered lidocaine subsequently spreads rapidly through the surrounding tissues and the anesthetic effect lasts approximately ten to twenty minutes when given intravenously and about sixty to ninety minutes after intramuscular injection [L5930].



Nevertheless, it appears that the efficacy of lidocaine may be minimized in the presence of inflammation [L5948]. This effect could be due to acidosis decreasing the amount of un-ionized lidocaine molecules, a more rapid reduction in lidocaine concentration as a result of increased blood flow, or potentially also because of increased production of inflammatory mediators like peroxynitrite that elicit direct actions on sodium channels [L5948].', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

It is a very common over-the-counter medication widely used as an analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic.[A39096]



The use of ibuprofen and its enantiomer [DB09213] in a racemic mix is common for the management of mild to moderate pain related to dysmenorrhea, headache, migraine, postoperative dental pain, spondylitis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and soft tissue disorder.[A39097]



Due to its activity against prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis, ibuprofen has been attributed to alteration of platelet function and prolongation of gestation and labour.[A39092]



As ibuprofen is a widely used medication, the main therapeutic indications are:



* Patent Ductus Arteriosus - it is a neonatal condition wherein the ductus arteriosus (blood vessel that connects the main pulmonary artery to the proximal descending aorta) fails to close after birth causing severe risk of heart failure. The prostaglandin inhibition of ibuprofen has been studied for the treatment of this condition as it is known that prostaglandin E2 is responsible for keeping the ductus arteriosus open.[A39100]



* Rheumatoid- and osteo-arthritis - ibuprofen is very commonly used in the symptomatic treatment of inflammatory, musculoskeletal and rheumatic disorders.[A39176]



* Cystic fibrosis - the use of high dosages of ibuprofen has been proven to decrease inflammation and decreasing polymorphonuclear cell influx in the lungs.[A39177]



* Orthostatic hypotension - ibuprofen can induce sodium retention and antagonize the effect of diuretics which has been reported to be beneficial for patients with severe orthostatic hypotension.[A1651]



* Dental pain - ibuprofen is used to manage acute and chronic orofacial pain.[A10901]



* Pain - ibuprofen is widely used to reduce minor aches and pains as well as to reduce fever and manage dysmenorrhea. It is very commonly used for the relief of acute indications such as fever and tension headaches.[A39092] It is also used to manage mild to moderate pain and moderate to severe pain as an adjunct to opioid analgesics.[L40208]



* Investigational uses - efforts have been put into developing ibuprofen for the prophylaxis of Alzheimer''s disease, Parkinson disease, and breast cancer.[A39092]', 'The exact mechanism of action of ibuprofen is unknown. However, ibuprofen is considered an NSAID and thus it is a non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, which is an enzyme involved in prostaglandin (mediators of pain and fever) and thromboxane (stimulators of blood clotting) synthesis via the arachidonic acid pathway.[L4614]



Ibuprofen is a non-selective COX inhibitor and hence, it inhibits the activity of both COX-1 and COX-2. The inhibition of COX-2 activity decreases the synthesis of prostaglandins involved in mediating inflammation, pain, fever, and swelling while the inhibition of COX-1 is thought to cause some of the side effects of ibuprofen including GI ulceration.[A39195]', 'Ibuprofen has multiple actions in different inflammatory pathways involved in acute and chronic inflammation. The main effects reported in ibuprofen are related to the control of pain, fever and acute inflammation by the inhibition of the synthesis of prostanoids by COX-1 and COX-2. Pain relief is attributed to peripheral affected regions and central nervous system effects in the pain transmission mediated by the dorsal horn and higher spinothalamic tract. Some reports have tried to link the pain regulation with a possible enhancement on the synthesis of endogenous cannabinoids and action on the NMDA receptors. The effect on pain has been shown to be related to the cortically evoked potentials.[A39190]



The antipyretic effect is reported to be linked to the effect on the prostanoid synthesis due to the fact that the prostanoids are the main signaling mediator of pyresis in the hypothalamic-preoptic region.[A39190]



The use of ibuprofen in dental procedures is attributed to the local inhibition of prostanoid production as well as to anti-oedemic activity and an increase of plasma beta-endorphins. Some reports have suggested a rapid local reduction of the expression of COX-2 in dental pulp derived by the administration of ibuprofen.[A39190]



The administration of ibuprofen in patients with rheumatic diseases has shown to control joint symptoms.[A39092] 



Ibuprofen is largely used in OTC products such as an agent for the management of dysmenorrhea which has been proven to reduce the amount of menstrual prostanoids and to produce a reduction in the uterine hypercontractility.[A39181] As well, it has been reported to reduce significantly the fever and the pain caused by migraines.[A39182, A39183] This effect is thought to be related to the effect on platelet activation and thromboxane A2 production which produces local vascular effects in the affected regions. This effect is viable as ibuprofen can enter in the central nervous system.[A39190]



In the investigational uses of ibuprofen, it has been reported to reduce neurodegeneration when given in low doses over a long time.[A39184] On the other hand, its use in Parkinson disease is related to the importance of inflammation and oxidative stress in the pathology of this condition.[A39185] The use of ibuprofen for breast cancer is related to a study that shows a decrease of 50% in the rate of breast cancer.[A39186]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

**Metformin extended-release tablet (XR)**



The extended-release formulation of metformin is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Safety in children has not been determined to this date.[L12207]



**Metformin combination products**



Metformin is a component of a variety of combination products with other anti-diabetic agents. It is indicated, along with diet and exercise, to improve glycemic control in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in combination with DPP-4 inhibitors ([sitagliptin], [linagliptin], [alogliptin], or [saxagliptin]),[L11479,L40248,L40253,L40258,L40263] in combination with SGLT2 inhibitors ([canagliflozin], [empagliflozin], [ertugliflozin], or [dapagliflozin]),[L11479,L30503,L1134,L13679,L38729] or in combination with [pioglitazone].[L11419]', 'Metformin''s mechanisms of action are unique from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic drugs. Metformin decreases blood glucose levels by decreasing hepatic glucose production (also called gluconeogenesis), decreasing the intestinal absorption of glucose, and increasing insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.[L12207] It is well established that metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I activity, and it has since been generally postulated that its potent antidiabetic effects occur through this mechanism.[A36534, A36557]   The above processes lead to a decrease in blood glucose, managing type II diabetes and exerting positive effects on glycemic control.



After ingestion, the organic cation transporter-1 (OCT1) is responsible for the uptake of metformin into hepatocytes (liver cells). As this drug is positively charged, it accumulates in cells and in the mitochondria because of the membrane potentials across the plasma membrane as well as the mitochondrial inner membrane. Metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I, preventing the production of mitochondrial ATP leading to increased cytoplasmic ADP:ATP and AMP:ATP ratios.[A36534] These changes activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an enzyme that plays an important role in the regulation of glucose metabolism.[A176348] Aside from this mechanism, AMPK can be activated by a lysosomal mechanism involving other activators.  Following this process, increases in AMP:ATP ratio also inhibit _fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase_ enzyme, resulting in the inhibition of gluconeogenesis, while also inhibiting _adenylate cyclase_ and decreasing the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP),[A36534] a derivative of ATP used for cell signaling [A176351]. Activated AMPK phosphorylates two isoforms of acetyl-CoA carboxylase enzyme, thereby inhibiting fat synthesis and leading to fat oxidation, reducing hepatic lipid stores and increasing liver sensitivity to insulin.[A36534] 



In the intestines, metformin increases anaerobic glucose metabolism in enterocytes (intestinal cells), leading to reduced net glucose uptake and increased delivery of lactate to the liver. Recent studies have also implicated the gut as a primary site of action of metformin and suggest that the liver may not be as important for metformin action in patients with type 2 diabetes. Some of the ways metformin may play a role on the intestines is by promoting the metabolism of glucose by increasing glucagon-like peptide I (GLP-1) as well as increasing gut utilization of glucose.[A36534] 



In addition to the above pathway, the mechanism of action of metformin may be explained by other ways, and its exact mechanism of action has been under extensive study in recent years.[A36535, A36554, A36555, A36557]', '**General effects**



Insulin is an important hormone that regulates blood glucose levels.[T514] Type II diabetes is characterized by a decrease in sensitivity to insulin, resulting in elevations in blood glucose when the pancreas can no longer compensate. In patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, insulin is unable to exert adequate effects on tissues and cells (i.e. insulin resistance)[T514] and insulin deficiency may also be present.[L5753]



Metformin reduces hepatic production of glucose, decreases the intestinal absorption of glucose, and enhances insulin sensitivity by increasing both peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. In contrast with drugs of the sulfonylurea class, which lead to hyperinsulinemia, the secretion of insulin is unchanged with metformin use.[L12207]



**Effect on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c)**



HbA1c is an important periodic measure of glycemic control used to monitor diabetic patients. Fasting plasma glucose is also a useful and important measure of glycemic control. In a 29-week clinical trial of subjects diagnosed with type II diabetes, metformin decreased the fasting plasma glucose levels by an average of 59 mg/dL from baseline, compared to an average increase of 6.3 mg/dL from baseline in subjects taking a placebo.[L12207]  Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was decreased by about 1.4% in subjects receiving metformin, and increased by 0.4% in subjects receiving placebo only.[L12207]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

• Angiographically documented coronary artery disease in patients without heart failure or an ejection fraction < 40%', '**Mechanism of action on blood pressure**



Amlodipine is considered a peripheral arterial vasodilator that exerts its action directly on vascular smooth muscle to lead to a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance, causing a decrease in blood pressure. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow-channel blocker) that inhibits the influx of calcium ions into both vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Experimental studies imply that amlodipine binds to both _dihydropyridine_ and _nondihydropyridine_ binding sites, located on cell membranes. The contraction of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent on the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells by specific ion channels. Amlodipine blocks calcium ion influx across cell membranes with selectivity. A stronger effect of amlodipine is exerted on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells [FDA label]. Direct actions of amlodipine on vascular smooth muscle result in reduced blood pressure [F3757]. 



**Mechanism of action in angina**



The exact mechanism by which amlodipine relieves the symptoms of angina have not been fully elucidated to this date, however, the mechanism of action is likely twofold:



Amlodipine has a dilating effect on peripheral arterioles, reducing the total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the cardiac muscle functions. Since the heart rate remains stable during amlodipine administration, the reduced work of the heart reduces both myocardial energy use and oxygen requirements [F3757].



Dilatation of the main coronary arteries and coronary arterioles, both in healthy and ischemic areas, is another possible mechanism of amlodipine reduction of blood pressure. The dilatation causes an increase in myocardial oxygen delivery in patients experiencing coronary artery spasm (Prinzmetal''s or variant angina) and reduces coronary vasoconstriction caused by smoking [F3757].', '**General pharmacodynamic effects**



Amlodipine has a strong affinity for cell membranes, modulating calcium influx by inhibiting selected membrane calcium channels. This drug''s unique binding properties allow for its long-acting action and less frequent dosing regimen [A573], [FDA label].  



**Hemodynamic effects**



After the administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine to patients diagnosed with hypertension, amlodipine causes vasodilation, which results in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressure. During these blood pressure reductions, there are no clinically significant changes in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with long-term use. Acute intravenous administration of amlodipine reduces arterial blood pressure and increases heart rate in patients with chronic stable angina, however, chronic oral administration of amlodipine in clinical studies did not cause clinically significant alterations in heart rate or blood pressures in patients diagnosed with angina and normal blood pressure. With long-term, once daily oral administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours [FDA label]. 



**Electrophysiologic effects**



Amlodipine does not change sinoatrial (SA) nodal function or atrioventricular (AV) conduction in animals or humans. In patients who were diagnosed with chronic stable angina, the intravenous administration of 10 mg of amlodipine did not cause clinically significant alterations A-H and H-V conduction and sinus node recovery time after cardiac pacing. Patients administered amlodipine with concomitant beta-blockers produced similar results. In clinical trials in which amlodipine was given in combination with beta-blockers to patients diagnosed with hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were noted. In clinical studies comprised of angina patients alone, amlodipine did not change electrocardiographic intervals or produce high degrees of AV block [FDA label]. 



**Effects on angina**



Amlodipine relieves the symptoms of chest pain associated with angina. In patients diagnosed with angina, daily administration of a single amlodipine dose increases total exercise time, the time to angina onset, and the time to 1 mm ST-segment depression on ECG studies, decreases anginal attack frequency, and decreases the requirement for nitroglycerin tablets [F3757].

Cineol containing preparations of eucalyptus oil may contain up to 80% (or more) 1,8-cineole [A32243] and is one of the most common types of eucalyptus oil formulations used. As an active agent indicated for relieving certain cold symptoms and/or certain muscular sprains and cramps, it is believed that eucalyptus oil may possess some antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities.



Some in vitro studies of human blood monocytes suggest a dose-dependent effect of eucalyptus oil to elicit significant inhibition of multiple cytokines, perhaps in the treatment of airway inflammation [A32244, A32245]. Moreover, other studies in animal models discuss the possibility of eucalyptus oil demonstrating anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects that potentially account for inhibiting the formation of prostaglandins and cytokines by stimulated monocytes in vitro [A32246, A32247].



Furthermore, additional studies have observed eucalyptus oil anti-viral activity against herpes simplex virus (HSV-1, HSV-2) in cell cultures as well as the demonstration of broad antimicrobial activity of eucalyptus medicinal plant extracts against Alicyclobacillus acidoterretris, Bacillus cereus, E. coli, Enterococcus faecalis, MRSA, Propionibacterium acnes, S. aureus, fungus including C. albicans isolates, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and other Gram-positive bacteria. Specific activity against periodontopathic bacteria, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sobrinus has also been observed [A32250, A32251, A32252, A32253, A32254].', 'Lipophilic monoterpene formulations of eucalyptus oil appear to be readily absorbed orally, with a primarily oxidative metabolism that might necessitate induction of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system and subsequent urinary excretion [A32236].

Hydrocarbons are capable of partitioning into the cell and cytoplasmic membrane of microorganisms and disrupt their vital functions, which may result in leakage of ions such as potassium, and the inhibition of respiration [A32439]. Eventually, cell lysis may occur due to weakening of the cell wall, and loss of turgor pressure and subsequent rupture of the cytoplasmic membrane [A32441].

Flupentixol in combination with [melitracen] is indicated to manage symptoms of anxiety, depression, and asthenia in adults.[L31923]', 'The mechanism of action of flupentixol is not completely understood. The antipsychotic actions are mainly thought to arise from cis(Z)-flupentixol, the active stereoisomer, acting as an antagonist at both dopamine D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> receptors with equal affinities.[A229398] Schizophrenia is a mental illness characterized by positive (such as hallucinations and delusions) and negative (such as affect flattening and apathy) symptoms. While several neurotransmitter systems are implicated in the pathophysiologic processes leading to the development of symptoms, the dopamine and glutamate systems have been extensively studied. It is generally understood that positive symptoms of schizophrenia arise from a dysregulated striatal dopamine pathway, leading to hyperstimulation of D<sub>2</sub> receptors. Many antipsychotic agents work by blocking D<sub>2</sub> receptors as antagonists;[A229428] similarly, cis(Z)-flupentixol, the active stereoisomer, is an antagonist at D<sub>2</sub> receptors.[A229398] However, there is now evidence that antipsychotic agents can work by blocking other dopamine receptor subtypes, such as D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>3</sub>, or D<sub>4</sub> receptors.[A229413, A229433, A229438] One study showed that cis(Z)-flupentixol is an antagonist at both dopamine D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> receptors with equal affinities,[A229398] and binds to D3 and D4 receptors with lower affinities. It also binds to alpha-1 adrenoceptors.[A229083] Antidepressant effects of flupentixol are understood to be mediated by antagonism at 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors, which are commonly downregulated following repeated antidepressant treatment.[A177847] Flupentixol also binds to 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors.[A229083] ', 'Flupentixol is an antipsychotic agent with anxiolytic and mild sedative actions. It exerts weak anticholinergic and adrenergic effects. It possesses antiemetic actions. As flupentixol works by antagonizing dopamine actions, it can cause extrapyramidal effects,[L31808] mostly at doses greater than 10 mg. In clinical trials, flupentixol-induced extrapyramidal effects have been managed with anti-Parkinsonian drugs.[A229403] Drug esterification in the intramuscular formulation of the drug results in slow release of the drug from the injection site and a prolonged duration of action.[L31808] Flupentixol has been investigated for use in mild to moderate depression: compared to other antidepressant agents, flupentixol has a rapid onset of action, where antidepressive effects were observed within the first two to three days after administration.[A229403]



As with other antipsychotic agents, flupentixol can cause QTc prolongation and increase the risk of arrhythmias. In clinical trials, flupentixol was associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular adverse events, stroke, and venous thromboembolism. Flupentixol can elevate the levels of prolactin; however, the clinical significance of hyperprolactinemia caused by neuroleptic drugs is unclear. Long-term hyperprolactinemia, when associated with hypogonadism, may lead to decreased bone mineral density in both female and male subjects.[L31808]



Interestingly, recent studies show that flupentixol exhibits anti-tumour properties alone or synergistically with other anticancer drugs like gefitinib.

', '**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].



Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].



In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].



There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].



Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].



The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. 



In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].



In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].



The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].', 'Zinc is involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of human proteins may bind zinc, in addition to hundreds of proteins that transport and traffic zinc. It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is an essential element for a proper sense of taste and smell and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations [L2211].



Studies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions [L2095]:



**Colds:** Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently [L2095].



**Wound healing:** Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements [L2095]. 



**Diahrrea**: Oral zinc supplements can reduce the symptoms of diarrhea in children with low levels of zinc, especially in cases of malnutrition [L2095].

These types of neurons are especially involved in transmission from the vestibular apparatus to the vomiting centre. Motion sickness principally involves overstimulation of these pathways due to various sensory stimuli.

Furthermore since cyclizine possesses anti-cholinergic properties as well, the muscarinic receptors are similarly blocked.', 'Cyclizine is a piperazine-derivative antihistamine used as an antivertigo/antiemetic agent. Cyclizine is used in the prevention and treatment of nausea, vomiting, and dizziness associated with motion sickness. Additionally, it has been used in the management of vertigo in diseases affecting the vestibular apparatus. Although the mechanism by which cyclizine exerts its antiemetic and antivertigo effects has not been fully elucidated, its central anticholinergic properties are partially responsible. The drug depresses labyrinth excitability and vestibular stimulation, and it may affect the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone. It also possesses anticholinergic, antihistaminic, central nervous system depressant, and local anesthetic effects.', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Verapamil is commonly used off-label for prophylaxis of cluster headaches.[A13983]', 'Verapamil inhibits L-type calcium channels by binding to a specific area of their alpha-1 subunit,[L10478]Cav1.2, which is highly expressed on L-type calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle and myocardial tissue where these channels are responsible for the control of peripheral vascular resistance and heart contractility.[A175396] Calcium influx through these channels allows for the propagation of action potentials necessary for the contraction of muscle tissue and the heart''s electrical pacemaker activity. Verapamil binds to these channels in a voltage- and frequency-dependent manner, meaning affinity is increased 1) as vascular smooth muscle membrane potential is reduced, and 2) with excessive depolarizing stimulus.[L10478] 



Verapamil''s mechanism of action in the treatment of angina and hypertension is likely due to the mechanism described above. Inhibition of calcium influx prevents the contraction of vascular smooth muscle, causing relaxation/dilation of blood vessels throughout the peripheral circulation - this lowers systemic vascular resistance (i.e. afterload) and thus blood pressure. This reduction in vascular resistance also reduces the force against which the heart must push, decreasing myocardial energy consumption and oxygen requirements and thus alleviating angina.[L8791]



Electrical activity through the AV node is responsible for determining heart rate, and this activity is dependent upon calcium influx through L-type calcium channels. By inhibiting these channels and decreasing the influx of calcium, verapamil prolongs the refractory period of the AV node and slows conduction, thereby slowing and controlling the heart rate in patients with arrhythmia.[L8791]



Verapamil''s mechanism of action in the treatment of cluster headaches is unclear, but is thought to result from an effect on other calcium channels (e.g. N-, P-, Q-, or T-type).[A13983]

At the recommended dose, the T1 shortening effect is observed with the greatest sensitivity in T1-weighted magnetic resonance sequences.

These folic acid congeners are transported across cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis where they are needed to maintain normal erythropoiesis, synthesize purine and thymidylate nucleic acids, interconvert amino acids, methylate tRNA, and generate and use formate. Using vitamin B12 as a cofactor, folic acid can normalize high homocysteine levels by remethylation of homocysteine to methionine via methionine synthetase.', 'Folic acid is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin found in foods such as liver, kidney, yeast, and leafy, green vegetables. Also known as folate or Vitamin B9, folic acid is an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in DNA and RNA synthesis. More specifically, folic acid is required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. Folic acid is the precursor of tetrahydrofolic acid, which is involved as a cofactor for transformylation reactions in the biosynthesis of purines and thymidylates of nucleic acids. Impairment of thymidylate synthesis in patients with folic acid deficiency is thought to account for the defective deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis that leads to megaloblast formation and megaloblastic and macrocytic anemias. Folic acid is particularly important during phases of rapid cell division, such as infancy, pregnancy, and erythropoiesis, and plays a protective factor in the development of cancer. As humans are unable to synthesize folic acid endogenously, diet and supplementation is necessary to prevent deficiencies. In order to function properly within the body, folic acid must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted by anti-metabolite therapies such as [DB00563] as they function as DHFR inhibitors to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, and therefore prevent the formation of DHF and THF.

After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Specifically glucocorticoids induce lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis, which then binds to cell membranes preventing the phospholipase A2 from coming into contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to diminished eicosanoid production. The cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) expression is also suppressed, potentiating the effect. In other words, the two main products in inflammation Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes are inhibited by the action of Glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids also stimulate the lipocortin-1 escaping to the extracellular space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits various inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines etc.) from neutrophils, macrophages and mastocytes. Additionally the immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding.', 'Hydrocortisone is the most important human glucocorticoid. It is essential for life and regulates or supports a variety of important cardiovascular, metabolic, immunologic and homeostatic functions. Topical hydrocortisone is used for its anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive properties to treat inflammation due to corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. Glucocorticoids are a class of steroid hormones characterised by an ability to bind with the cortisol receptor and trigger a variety of important cardiovascular, metabolic, immunologic and homeostatic effects. Glucocorticoids are distinguished from mineralocorticoids and sex steroids by having different receptors, target cells, and effects. Technically, the term corticosteroid refers to both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, but is often used as a synonym for glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoids suppress cell-mediated immunity. They act by inhibiting genes that code for the cytokines IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha, the most important of which is the IL-2. Reduced cytokine production limits T cell proliferation. Glucocorticoids also suppress humoral immunity, causing B cells to express lower amounts of IL-2 and IL-2 receptors. This diminishes both B cell clonal expansion and antibody synthesis. The diminished amounts of IL-2 also leads to fewer T lymphocyte cells being activated.', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

The retention of phosphate plays a pivotal role in causing secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with osteodystrophy, and soft-tissue calcification. The mechanism by which phosphate retention leads to hyperparathyroidism is not clearly delineated. Therapeutic efforts directed toward the control of hyperphosphatemia include reduction in the dietary intake of phosphate, inhibition of absorption of phosphate in the intestine with phosphate binders, and removal of phosphate from the body by more efficient methods of dialysis. The rate of removal of phosphate by dietary manipulation or by dialysis is insufficient. Dialysis patients absorb 40% to 80% of dietary phosphorus. Therefore, the fraction of dietary phosphate absorbed from the diet needs to be reduced by using phosphate binders in most renal failure patients on maintenance dialysis. Calcium acetate when taken with meals combines with dietary phosphate to form insoluble calcium phosphate which is excreted in the feces. Maintenance of serum phosphorus below 6.0 mg/dl is generally considered as a clinically acceptable outcome of treatment with phosphate binders.

Candesartan confers blood pressure lowering effects by antagonizing the hypertensive effects of angiotensin II via the RAAS. RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. Renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is cleaved by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II increases blood pressure by increasing total peripheral resistance, increasing sodium and water reabsorption in the kidneys via aldosterone secretion, and altering cardiovascular structure. Angiotensin II binds to two receptors: type-1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1) and type-2 angiotensin II receptor (AT2). AT1 is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that mediates the vasoconstrictive and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II. Studies performed in recent years suggest that AT2 antagonizes AT1-mediated effects and directly affects long-term blood pressure control by inducing vasorelaxation and increasing urinary sodium excretion. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are non-peptide competitive inhibitors of AT1. ARBs block the ability of angiotensin II to stimulate pressor and cell proliferative effects.

', '**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].



Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].



In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].



There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].



Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].



The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. 



In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].



In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].



The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].', 'Zinc is involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of human proteins may bind zinc, in addition to hundreds of proteins that transport and traffic zinc. It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is an essential element for a proper sense of taste and smell and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations [L2211].



Studies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions [L2095]:



**Colds:** Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently [L2095].



**Wound healing:** Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements [L2095]. 



**Diahrrea**: Oral zinc supplements can reduce the symptoms of diarrhea in children with low levels of zinc, especially in cases of malnutrition [L2095].

Its role in potentiating insulin signalling cascades has been implicated in several studies. Chromium upregulates insulin-stimulated insulin signal transduction via affecting effector molecules downstream of the insulin receptor (IR). IR-mediated signalling pathway involves phoshorylation of multiple intracellular domains and protein kinases, and downstream effector molecules [A32353]. Upon activation by ligands, intracellular β-subunit of IR autophosphorylates and activates tyrosine kinase domain of the IR, followed by activation and phosphorylation of regulatory proteins and downstream signalling effectors including phosphatidylinositol 2-kinase (PI3K). PI3K activates further downstream reaction cascades to activate protein kinase B (Akt) to ultimately promote translocation of glucose transporter-4 (Glut4)-vesicles from the cytoplasm to the cell surface and regulate glucose uptake [A32353]. Chromium enhances the kinase activity of insulin receptor β and increases the activity of downstream effectors, pI3-kinase and Akt. 



Under insulin-resistant conditions, chromium also promotes GLUT-4 transporter translocation that is independent of activity of IR, IRS-1, PI3-kinase, or Akt; chromium mediates cholesterol efflux from the membranes via increasing fluidity of the membrane by decreasing the membrane cholesterol and upregulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein [A32353]. As a result, intracellular GLUT-4 transporters are stimulated to translocate from intracellular to the plasma membrane, leading to enhanced glucose uptake in muscle cells [L1990]. Chromium attenuates the activity of PTP-1B _in vitro,_ which is a negative regulator of insulin signaling. It also alleviates ER stress that is observed to be elevated the suppression of insulin signaling. ER stress is thought to activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which subsequently induces serine phosphorylation of IRS and aberration of insulin signalling [A32353]. Transient upregulation of AMPK by chromium also leads to increased glucose uptake [A32353]. ', 'Trivalent chromium is part of glucose tolerance factor, an essential activator of insulin-mediated reactions. Chromium helps to maintain normal glucose metabolism and peripheral nerve function. Chromium increases insulin binding to cells, increases insulin receptor density and activates insulin receptor kinase leading to enhanced insulin sensitivity [A32351].
