The risk may also be increased during coadministration of bupropion with other potentially epileptogenic agents such as interferons. Coadministration of beta interferons with other agents known to induce hepatotoxicity may potentiate the risk of liver injury. Use of beta interferons has been associated with rare cases of liver injury, including autoimmune hepatitis and severe liver damage leading to hepatic failure, some of which required transplantation. Symptoms of liver dysfunction typically began from 1 to 6 months following the initiation of therapy. Asymptomatic elevation of hepatic transaminases (particularly SGPT) have also been reported but is common with interferon therapy.', 'DDInter', 'Caution is advised if bupropion is administered with beta interferons, particularly in the elderly and in patients with a history of seizures or other risk factors for seizures (e.g., head trauma; brain tumor; severe hepatic cirrhosis; metabolic disorders; CNS infections; excessive use of alcohol or sedatives; addiction to opiates, cocaine, or stimulants; diabetes treated with oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin). The manufacturer recommends a lower initial dosage of bupropion and gradual dosage increments in patients receiving concurrent treatment with other potentially epileptogenic drugs. The total dose of bupropion should generally not exceed 450 mg/day (or 150 mg every other day in patients with severe hepatic cirrhosis). Bupropion should be discontinued and not restarted in patients who experience a seizure during treatment.The risk of hepatic injury should also be considered with this combination. Liver function tests should be monitored at regular intervals and the interferon dosage reduced if SGPT rises above 5 times the upper limit of normal. The dosage may be gradually re-escalated when enzyme levels return to normal. Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they experience signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as fever, rash, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, right upper quadrant pain, dark urine, and jaundice.

The proposed mechanism is decreased clearance due to inhibition of CYP450 2D6 activity. Increased concentrations of valbenazine and (+)-alfa-dihydrotetrabenazine may lead to clinically significant prolongation of the QT interval. In general, the risk of an individual agent or a combination of agents causing ventricular arrhythmia in association with QT prolongation is largely unpredictable but may be increased by certain underlying risk factors such as congenital long QT syndrome, cardiac disease, and electrolyte disturbances (e.g., hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia). The extent of drug-induced QT prolongation is dependent on the particular drugs involved and dosages of the drugs. In addition, central nervous system (CNS)-depressant effects may be additively or synergistically increased in patients taking valbenazine with certain other drugs that cause these effects, especially in elderly or debilitated patients.', 'DDInter', 'Pharmacologic response to valbenazine should be monitored more closely whenever a strong inhibitor of CYP450 2D6 (e.g., paroxetine, fluoxetine, quinidine) is added to or withdrawn from therapy. Valbenazine is not recommended for use in patients with congenital long QT syndrome or with arrhythmias associated with a prolonged QT interval. Assessment of baseline QT interval and periodic monitoring during therapy may be considered. The manufacturer recommends a dosage reduction for valbenazine during concomitant administration with strong CYP450 2D6 inhibitors or in patients who are poor metabolizers of CYP450 2D6. Patients should be advised to seek prompt medical attention if they experience symptoms that could indicate the occurrence of torsade de pointes such as dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, palpitation, irregular heart rhythm, shortness of breath, or syncope. When valbenazine is used in combination with other drugs that cause CNS depression, patients should be monitored for potentially excessive or prolonged CNS depression. Ambulatory patients should be counseled to avoid hazardous activities requiring mental alertness and motor coordination until they know how these agents affect them, and to notify their doctor if they experience excessive or prolonged CNS effects that interfere with their normal activities.', 'Metabolism', 'Pharmacologic response to valbenazine should be monitored more closely whenever a strong inhibitor of CYP450 2D6 (e.', 'Major', 'pharmacodynamic', NULL, 'https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/28539/', '[1] "Product Information.
