Serious adverse events include tetany, seizures, tremor, carpopedal spasm, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, and abnormal QT interval; however, patients do not always exhibit these symptoms. Hypomagnesemia can also cause impaired parathyroid hormone secretion, which may lead to hypocalcemia.
