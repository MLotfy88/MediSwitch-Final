Renal toxicity has been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion:  in such patients, NSAIDs may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin synthesis and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation.  Patients at greatest risk for this reaction include the elderly, those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, or liver dysfunction, and those taking diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers; discontinuation of NSAID therapy will usually lead to recovery to the pretreatment state.  No information is available regarding use NSAIDs in patients with advanced renal disease; the renal effects of NSAIDs may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease.  Volume status should be corrected in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating treatment.  Renal function should be monitored during therapy in patients with renal or liver dysfunction, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia.
