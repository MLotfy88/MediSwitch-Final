In addition, some have found that the benefits of ACE inhibitors on morbidity and mortality in post-acute myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, and particularly congestive heart failure may be compromised or even nullified by aspirin. The proposed mechanism is aspirin inhibition of cyclooxygenase, resulting in suppression of prostaglandin synthesis and prostaglandin-mediated hemodynamic effects of ACE inhibitors.
