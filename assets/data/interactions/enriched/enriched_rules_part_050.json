Patients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience potential signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as fever, rash, itching, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, malaise, right upper quadrant pain, dark urine, pale stools, and jaundice. Baseline and regular monitoring of hepatic function is recommended. Thioguanine therapy should be discontinued if there is evidence of toxic hepatitis or biliary stasis, as reversal of signs and symptoms of liver toxicity have been reported upon withdrawal. Early indications of liver toxicity are signs associated with portal hypertension such as thrombocytopenia out of proportion with neutropenia and splenomegaly. Elevations of liver enzymes have also been reported, but do not always occur.",

Discontinuation of the statin led to resolution of symptoms and normalization of TSH levels. In one case, the patient was subsequently prescribed pravastatin without any adverse effects on his thyroid status. No particular intervention should be necessary when lovastatin or simvastatin is prescribed to patients receiving thyroid hormone therapy, since the interaction appears to be extremely rare. However, thyroid hormone dosage may need to be adjusted if an interaction is suspected.

Symptoms of the excitatory reaction may include agitation, headache, diaphoresis, hyperpyrexia, flushing, shivering, myoclonus, rigidity, tremor, diarrhea, hypertension, tachycardia, seizures, and coma. The exact mechanism of interaction is unknown, but may involve excessive serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (i.e., serotonin syndrome). The interaction is unpredictable and has been reported primarily with meperidine or fentanyl and various MAOIs including phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid, moclobemide, and selegiline. Fatal hyperpyrexia and hypertension have also been observed in animal studies with meperidine and phenelzine or furazolidone. In contrast, symptoms of the depressive reaction probably stem from potentiation of CNS effects by MAOIs and include respiratory depression, cyanosis, hypotension, and coma.",
