In patients with prerenal conditions whose renal perfusion may be dependent on the function of renal prostaglandins, NSAIDs may precipitate overt renal decompensation via a dose-related inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.  Patients at greatest risk for this reaction include geriatric patients and those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, or substantial volume and/or sodium depletion (e.g., due to diuretics).  Therapy with ketorolac should be administered cautiously in such patients, and hypovolemia and hyponatremia should be corrected prior to initiating treatment.  Clinical monitoring of renal function is recommended during therapy.  If renal function declines or renal failure occurs, prompt discontinuation of ketorolac therapy will usually lead to recovery to the pretreatment state.
