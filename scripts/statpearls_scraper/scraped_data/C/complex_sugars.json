    "indications": "Radiation proctitis refers to injury or damage to the rectum secondary to radiation therapy. It is postulated that almost half of all patients with pelvic malignancies undergo treatment that involves radiation.\n[1]\n\nThe clinical manifestation of radiation proctitis varies and is broadly categorized into acute and chronic phases. Acute radiation proctitis typically occurs during or immediately after the radiation treatment period, manifesting with symptoms such as diarrhea, rectal urgency, and mild rectal bleeding. On the other hand, chronic radiation proctitis develops more than 3 months after the completion of radiation therapy, and its symptoms can be more persistent and severe. Chronic proctitis may lead to complications like rectal strictures, ulcerations, and even fistulas, significantly impacting the patient's quality of life.\n\nThe increasing incidence of radiation proctitis is closely tied to advancements in cancer treatment, leading to improved overall survival rates. As patients with pelvic malignancies live longer, healthcare professionals are likely to encounter a growing number of individuals experiencing the long-term effects of radiation proctitis. Management strategies involve a multidisciplinary approach, combining the expertise of radiation oncologists, gastroenterologists, advanced care practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals. Treatment may include medications to alleviate symptoms, dietary modifications, and, in severe cases, endoscopic or surgical interventions. Ongoing research continues to explore novel therapies and preventative measures, aiming to enhance the quality of care and patient outcomes for those affected by radiation proctitis.",
    "mechanism": "Radiation proctitis occurs as a result of radiation therapy for malignancy to organs in the pelvis, including the prostate, rectum, and reproductive organs. The degree of radiation proctitis varies, depending on the modality by which the radiation is delivered, the radiation dose, and the volume of irradiated tissue. Several specific risk factors have been identified, such as a dose of radiation to the rectum >45 Gy, a history of inflammatory bowel disease, HIV/AIDS, and a possible genetic predisposition.\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]",
    "monitoring": "After completing a thorough history and physical examination, the next step is to perform either a rigid or flexible sigmoidoscopy. An experienced colorectal surgeon or gastroenterologist should perform this exam with minimal insufflation as the inflamed bowel is more susceptible to perforation, especially as it becomes fixated. The examination is likely to reveal a friable mucosa with a multitude of changes, including edema, oozing, and ulcerations.\n[12]\n[13]\n\nThe mucosa may sometimes appear similar to that seen in inflammatory bowel disease with pseudopolyp formation. Areas of ulceration may require a biopsy, but this must be done cautiously (see\nImage.\nColonoscopy of Radiation Proctitis, Moderate-to-Severe). There are likely to be multiple areas of strictures that can be indistinguishable from recurrent malignancy.\n[14]\n\nBarium or water-soluble enema studies may also be performed, which can identify strictures, obstruction, shortening, and narrowing of the rectosigmoid area with loss of the normal curvature. It may also demonstrate decreased compliance of the rectum. The presacral space may appear to be increased due to rectal wall thickening.\n[15]\n\nOnce the diagnosis of radiation proctitis has been established, several grading systems exist to gauge severity, including RTOG/EORTC and LENT-SOMA.",
    "administration": "Primary Prevention\n\nProphylactic medical therapies such as sucralfate, amifostine, and misoprostol have failed to demonstrate a reduction in the risk of proctitis in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy. However, data suggests that selenium supplementation taken during radiation treatments may reduce the risk of grade 2+ diarrhea. A small randomized trial of patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy for uterine and cervical cancer taking 500 mg of selenium versus placebo demonstrated a significant reduction in the rate of grade 2+ diarrhea (20.5% vs 44.5%).\n[16]\n\nAnother avenue to minimize the risk of proctitis is the radiation planning and delivery process. Most of the data regarding late rectal complications are derived from the treatment of prostate cancer. There is a consistent dose-volume relationship with the risk of grade ≥2 rectal toxicity across several studies, specifically the volume of rectum receiving ≥60 Gy.\n[2]\nThis emphasizes the importance of radiation delivery and the planning process in preventing late rectal toxicities. Several dose constraints have been put forward. For conventionally fractioned radiotherapy, the V50 <50%, V65 <25%, V70 <20%, and V75 <15% have been used, although they were derived from the 3D treatment era and easily met Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT).\n[2]\nThe QUANTEC dose constraints are a conservative starting point that, if adhered to, predict a grade ≥2 late rectal toxicity <15%.\n[2]\nRectal constraints also exist for hypofractionated radiotherapy and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).\n\nWhile adherence to established dose constraints is essential, how radiotherapy is delivered can also influence the risk of late rectal toxicity. When comparing 3D conformal treatment to IMRT when treating the pelvis, the incidence of late rectal toxicity appears to be lower with IMRT in the treatment of genitourinary and gynecologic malignancies. Late rectal toxicity in patients treated with 3D radiation for prostate cancer was 13% versus 5% in those treated with IMRT.\n[17]\nPostoperative endometrial and cervical cancer patients treated with IMRT also demonstrate lower rates of late gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity compared to 3D conformal (42% vs 21%).\n[18]\n[19]\nDespite the claims that proton therapy will lead to even lower rates of toxicity, the data suggest that proton therapy, at best, has no effect and, at worst, may have higher rates of GI toxicity compared to IMRT for patients with prostate cancer.\n[20]\n[21]\n\nImprovements in daily image guidance also contribute to the reduction of late rectal toxicity as they allow for tumor and normal tissue motion to be taken into account, allowing for smaller planning target volumes (PTV) margins. Retrospective analysis of prostate cancer patients treated with IMRT and image guidance demonstrated a reduction in 3-year late rectal toxicity compared to those treated with IMRT without image guidance (4.1% vs 13.1%).\n[22]\n\nOther preventative methods include introducing a physical space between the rectum and the target structure. Hyaluronic acid spacers involve the injection of a gel into the perirectal fat, thus enlarging the space between the anterior rectal wall and the posterior aspect of the prostate. Randomized multicenter data have demonstrated not only improved rectal V50-80 dosimetric parameters but also a reduction in late rectal toxicity with no patients experiencing >1 grade toxicity. There were no differences in acute rectal toxicity.\n[23]\n\nMedical Interventions\n\nAcute Proctitis\n\nIf primary prevention fails, patients may develop acute radiation proctitis during treatment or within 6 months posttreatment. Acute proctitis is self-limited for most patients, and treatment is largely supportive. Unfortunately, many of these interventions lack evidence to support their use but are nevertheless utilized to address symptoms such as diarrhea, tenesmus, and rectal urgency. Patients who develop acute GI toxicity during treatment have a 42% ten-year likelihood of late GI toxicity compared to 9% in those who did not experience acute side effects.\n[17]\nAntimotility agents such as loperamide and diphenoxylate are used for patients experiencing diarrhea. Other symptoms, such as rectal urgency and tenesmus, have been treated with sodium butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid. A small randomized crossover trial of patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy demonstrated a clear remission of symptoms with topical sodium butyrate compared to saline enemas.\n[24]\nOther therapies include mesalamine or corticosteroid enemas. In cases of extreme discomfort, treatment may be suspended to allow some tissue recovery and symptom resolution, but this delay may adversely affect the oncological outcome.\n\nChronic Proctitis\n\nPatients who develop chronic proctitis over the ensuing months to years after treatment have several medical treatment options. Evidence for the various treatments ranges from anecdotal to small randomized prospective trials.\n\nSome studies found sucralfate enemas helpful, with clinical improvement in 73% of patients who received pelvic radiotherapy and had continued tenesmus and rectal bleeding.\n[25]\nA prospective randomized, double-blind study comparing sucralfate enemas to rectal sulfasalazine and prednisone demonstrated better tolerance of sucralfate and superior clinical response.\nNinety-two percent of patients had a significant reduction in rectal bleeding at the 4-month follow-up.\n[26]\nA possible mechanism of action is the repair of microvascular damage through the stimulation of angiogenesis and glutathione production.\n[27]\n\nFormalin (ie, formaldehyde 4% to 10%) has been studied and used to treat chronic radiation proctitis for over 20 years.\n[28]\nThe advantages of formalin treatment are that it can be utilized in the clinical setting without general anesthesia and with only light sedation. The mechanism of action of formalin is the chemical cauterization of the ulcers and telangiectasias, which are the source of bleeding in chronic proctitis. The formalin can be applied with the direct application of a gauze that has been soaked in formalin and the direct application of it to the mucosa of the affected areas, usually under direct vision using rigid proctoscopy. The concentration of formalin is typically 4%, although some studies have utilized a 10% solution. A study from Poland showed that after the first application, 50% of the patients had complete resolution of their symptoms, and most patients required an average of 2 treatments.\n[29]\n\nGlucocorticoid suppositories have also been utilized for patients with continued rectal bleeding. The anti-inflammatory effects are thought to lead to symptomatic improvement. However, an open randomized trial of mesalamine suppositories versus hydrocortisone foam demonstrated higher rates of hematochezia and mucus in the stool after 2 weeks of treatment with hydrocortisone foam.\n[30]\n\nThe latest clinical consensus guidelines from the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgery suggest that short-chain fatty acid enemas are not useful in treating chronic radiation proctitis.\n[31]\nOver the years, there have been investigations into other treatments, including ozone therapy, mesalamine, and metronidazole. However, no evidence exists to support their efficacy.\n[32]\n\nIn patients who are refractory to medical treatment, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) has reasonable evidence to support its use for radiation proctitis.\n[33]\n[34]\nA randomized trial of 2.0 atm vs 1.1 atm demonstrated a significant improvement in healing responses and late effects normal tissue-subjective, objective, management, and analytic (LENT-SOMA) scores.\n[35]\nA Cochrane review of HBO therapy concluded it is a safe and likely efficacious intervention for patients with refractory radiation proctitis.\n[36]\n\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that endoscopic argon beam plasma coagulation can reduce bleeding by approximately 79% to 100%.\n[37]\nThis treatment is not without adverse effects. Complications include rectal ulcerations and fistula formation. While endoscopic argon beam plasma coagulation treatment has been substantiated, other endoscopic treatments, such as bipolar electrocoagulation, radio-frequency ablation, and Nd-YAG laser, have not been sufficiently studied.\n[32]\n\nPatients may develop strictures and present with obstructive symptoms that may not respond to stool softeners. Endoscopic Savary-Gilliard dilatation may be used in patients with short strictures that are not responsive to medical therapy. In patients with longer strictures, surgery may be preferable.\n\nSurgery is reserved for patients who do not show improvement in their symptoms following the above medical and endoscopic interventions. It is also used for some of the more severe complications that are associated with radiation proctitis, including strictures that may lead to large bowel obstruction, fistulas, or even perforation. Studies have estimated that only 10% of patients with radiation proctitis will ultimately require operative intervention.\n[38]\nIn very severe cases, a proctectomy may be necessary. However, studies have demonstrated that diversion in the form of an ileostomy or colostomy may improve quality of life, and no further surgical procedures may be needed.\n[39]",
    "adverse_effects": "The complications of radiation proctitis can significantly impact the quality of life of individuals undergoing pelvic radiation therapy and include the following:\n\nColitis\nBowel perforation\nSepsis\nFistula formation\nRadiation associated malignancies\n\nIn its acute phase, patients may experience symptoms such as diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and abdominal pain. However, the transition to chronic radiation proctitis, occurring more than 3 months posttreatment, can lead to persistent and potentially severe complications. Chronic symptoms may include rectal strictures, fecal urgency, and incontinence, posing substantial challenges to daily activities. In some cases, radiation proctitis can progress to more severe outcomes, such as fistulas or perforations, necessitating surgical intervention. The complexity of managing these complications underscores the importance of proactive monitoring, early intervention, and a multidisciplinary approach to provide comprehensive care for individuals affected by radiation proctitis."
