    "toxicity": "Managing the Adverse Effects of Keratoconjunctivitis Therapy\n\nClinicians should anticipate adverse effects from keratoconjunctivitis treatments and be prepared to manage them. Addressing these effects helps preserve vision, enhance patient comfort, and minimize long-term complications.\n\nThe risks of using topical corticosteroids long-term include increased IOP, cataract formation, and secondary infections. To manage these risks, clinicians should regularly monitor IOP, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, and consider switching to safer alternatives like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs when appropriate.\n[111]\nSimilarly, preservatives like benzalkonium chloride, commonly found in eye drops, can cause chronic epithelial toxicity and worsen dryness with prolonged use. To mitigate these effects, switching to preservative-free formulations is recommended, and lubricating eye drops should be used to support epithelial healing.\n\nCyclosporine A (Restasis) may cause a burning sensation or irritation upon application. To manage these effects, clinicians can advise patients to store the medication in a cool place to reduce discomfort upon instilling. Additionally, adjunctive lubricants may be used to alleviate symptoms.\n[112]\nLifitegrast may cause dysgeusia (altered taste) or a burning sensation. Clinicians should encourage patients to continue using this medication, as these symptoms often diminish with time. Lubricating eye drops may be recommended alongside the treatment to reduce irritation.\n[113]\n\nContact or scleral lenses may cause ocular injury, eg, corneal abrasions, infections, or hypoxia, if they do not fit properly or are used for an extended period. Poor hygiene by the user may also contribute to ocular damage. To mitigate these risks, the specialist should ensure proper lens fitting and stress the importance of hygiene, regular lens replacement, and proper care. Use should be discontinued if active infection or inflammation occurs.\n[114]\n\nAllergy or hypersensitivity to medications may cause redness, swelling, and increased discomfort. Management involves discontinuing the offending medication and switching to an alternative treatment. Antihistamines may also be used to address allergic symptoms and alleviate discomfort.\n[115]\n\nManaging the Long-Term Complications of Chronic Inflammation\n\nChronic inflammation in keratoconjunctivitis can lead to fibrosis and scarring of the conjunctiva or cornea, resulting in visual impairment. In severe cases, antiscarring agents such as mitomycin C may be used to manage scarring. For advanced cases, surgical interventions like conjunctival transplantation may be necessary.\n[116]\n\nAdditionally, neurotrophic keratopathy, which results from a loss of corneal sensation, can lead to delayed epithelial healing and recurrent defects. Preservative-free lubricants and autologous serum eye drops are recommended to manage this condition. In severe instances, protective measures like tarsorrhaphy may be considered.\n[117]\n\nChronic inflammation also increases the risk of recurrent infections, whether bacterial or viral. Prophylactic use of antimicrobial agents during flare-ups, along with strict hygiene practices, can help reduce the occurrence of infections.\n\nSupportive Care and Patient Education\n\nPatients should be educated on the proper use of medications and the importance of adherence to prescribed treatment. Regular follow-up visits should be encouraged to monitor for early signs of toxicity or adverse effects. Lifestyle recommendations, such as avoiding allergens or irritants and using protective eyewear, should be provided.\n[118]\n\nEffective toxicity and adverse effect management are essential when treating keratoconjunctivitis to optimize outcomes and preserve vision. By identifying potential complications early and implementing tailored interventions, healthcare providers can minimize the risk of long-term damage and enhance the patient's quality of life."
