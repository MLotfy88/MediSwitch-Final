    "indications": "Cetirizine is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to it or any of its ingredients. Cetirizine is also contraindicated in anyone with a known hypersensitivity to hydroxyzine, as cetirizine is a metabolite of hydroxyzine.\n[35]\n\nWarnings and Precautions\n\nThere are few well-controlled human studies on cetirizine in pregnant mothers, although these showed it to be safe during pregnancy in animal studies. First-generation antihistamines, diphenhydramine, and doxylamine are safest to use during pregnancy. However, first-generation antihistamines are more likely than second-generation antihistamines to cause somnolence; clinicians should counsel the patients regarding the potential adverse effects of the medication they choose to take during pregnancy.\n[24]",
    "mechanism": "Cetirizine is a fast-acting, highly selective peripheral histamine H1-receptor antagonist. The H1-receptors inhibited by cetirizine are primarily on respiratory smooth muscle cells, vascular endothelial cells, immune cells, and the gastrointestinal tract. Unlike first-generation antihistamines such as diphenhydramine and doxylamine, cetirizine does not cross the blood-brain barrier to a large extent, avoiding the neurons of the central nervous system. As a result, cetirizine produces minimal sedation compared to many first-generation antihistamines.\n[13]\n\nGiven its antagonism with histamine H1-receptors, cetirizine effectively reverses many of the effects of histamine. Like other second-generation antihistamines, cetirizine decreases vascular permeability, decreasing fluid escaping to tissues from capillaries. Cetirizine is also an inhibitor of histamine-induced bronchospasm.\n[14]\n\nCetirizine has demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory activity, reducing the infiltration of inflammatory cells in allergic rhinitis.\n[15]\nSpecifically, research has found that cetirizine minimizes the migration of neutrophils and eosinophils.\n[16]\n\nPharmacokinetics\n\nAbsorption:\nCetirizine is absorbed rapidly in the gastrointestinal tract and undergoes substantial excretion by the kidney. Cetirizine reaches peak plasma concentration after approximately 1 hour. The effects of cetirizine typically begin after 20 to 60 minutes and persist for at least 24 hours. Food does not affect the extent of exposure (AUC) of cetirizine, but the time to attain peak concentration is delayed by 1.7 hours.\n\nDistribution:\nThe mean plasma protein binding of cetirizine is 93%.\n\nMetabolism:\nCetirizine undergoes oxidative O-dealkylation to a metabolite with negligible antihistaminic activity. Cetirizine is not a substrate of the CYP450 system.\n[17]\n[18]\nEvidence indicates that cetirizine is a P-glycoprotein substrate, which should be considered in patients using cetirizine concurrently with P-gp inhibitors.\n[19]\n\nExcretion:\nThe elimination half-life of cetirizine is 8.3 hours. Cetirizine is primarily excreted through the kidney.\n[20]",
    "administration": "Available Dosage Forms and Strengths\n\nCetirizine is available as oral tablets, capsules, solutions, and orally disintegrating tablets. The dosing of cetirizine depends on the patient's age. In adults and children 12 years or older, the recommended dose is 5 to 10 mg/d orally, depending on symptom severity.\n[21]\nCetirizine is available in 5 mg and 10 mg tablets and 5 mg/5 mL oral solution and elixir. The ophthalmic formulation is 0.24% cetirizine hydrochloride eye drops in 5 mL and 7.5 mL bottles. Cetirizine 5 mg combined with pseudoephedrine HCl 120 mg is a nasal decongestant that temporarily relieves sinus congestion and pressure.\n\nChildren 6 to 11 years old: 5 to 10 mg (1 or 2 teaspoons) once daily in syrup form is recommended, depending on symptom severity.\n[22]\nChildren 2 to 5 years old: 2.5 mg (half a teaspoon) in syrup form once daily.\nChildren 6 months to 23 months old: the recommended dose is 2.5 mg (half teaspoon) in syrup form once daily.\nOne drop (0.24% cetirizine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution) is instilled in the affected eye twice daily for patients with allergic conjunctivitis.\nThe FDA has approved the IV administration of cetirizine 10 mg to treat acute urticaria in adults and adolescents aged 12 and older.\n\nUse in Specific Patient Population\n\nBreastfeeding Considerations:\nOccasional and small doses of cetirizine are acceptable while breastfeeding. Prolonged use of larger doses may cause a decrease in the milk supply or drowsiness and other adverse effects in the infant, particularly when combined with pseudoephedrine. The use of an ophthalmic formulation of cetirizine by the mother is thought to have minimal risk to the breastfed infant. Clinicians should advise the mother to apply pressure over the tear duct by the corner of the eye and remove the leftover solution to decrease the drug that reaches the breast milk.\n[23]\n\nPregnancy Considerations:\nCetirizine is a former U.S. FDA pregnancy category B medicine.\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (ACOG-ACAAI) recommend cetirizine for pregnant women who require antihistamine treatment. Cetirizine should be used in pregnancy only when necessary.\n[24]\n[25]\n\nHepatic Impairment:\nAccording to the manufacturer's prescribing information, the dose for 12-year-old and older patients with hepatic impairment should be reduced to 5 mg daily. The manufacturer also recommends lowering the dose for patients 6 to 11 years old with hepatic impairment. Intravenous administration of cetirizine is intended for short-term use; no dose adjustment is required per the manufacturer's labeling.\n\nRenal Impairment:\nManufacturers' prescribing information suggests reducing the dose to 5 mg daily for patients aged 12 years and older with decreased renal function (CrCL 11 to 31 mL/min) and patients on hemodialysis. The manufacturer also recommends lowering the dose for 6 to 11-year-old patients with renal impairment. The IV formulation of cetirizine is intended for short-term use; no dose adjustment is required per the manufacturer's labeling.\n\nPediatric Patients:\nAccording to one meta-analysis, there is moderate to low certainty evidence that cetirizine may improve clinical outcomes and quality of life in children with allergic rhinitis. Cetirizine demonstrates comparable efficacy with other antihistamines and is generally well tolerated, although there is an increased risk of somnolence in the pediatric population.\n[26]\nThe intravenous formulation is FDA-approved for urticaria in children 6 months and older. For adolescents aged 12 years and older, the recommended intravenous dosage of cetirizine is 10 mg. Children aged 6 to 11 years old may receive either 5 mg to 10 mg, depending on symptom severity. For children aged 6 months to 5 years, the recommended intravenous dosage is 2.5 mg.\n\nOlder Patients:\nEfficacy evaluations did not include an adequate number of patients aged 65 years and older to determine potential divergent response patterns compared to younger patients. Safety assessments of cetirizine in older patients compared to younger adults revealed no significant differences. However, sensitivity to adverse drug reactions in certain older individuals remains a possibility.\n\nOphthalmic Formulation:\nEach bottle of 0.24% cetirizine hydrochloride contains benzalkonium chloride and can be absorbed by contact lenses. Manufacturers advise patients to remove contact lenses and wait 10 minutes after administration until the reinsertion of lenses. If irritation or redness persists after this precaution, contact lenses should be avoided. Cetirizine has proven safe and effective for pediatric patients 2 years and older in clinical studies.\n[27]",
    "adverse_effects": "Cetirizine is safe and relatively well-tolerated for treating allergic rhinitis and urticaria. Although uncommon, its primary adverse effects in adults include somnolence, fatigue, pharyngitis, dizziness, and dry mouth.\n[1]\n\nSomnolence appears to be a dose-related effect of cetirizine. Research indicates that in some patients, cetirizine contributes to daytime sleepiness.\n[28]\n\nChildren taking cetirizine most commonly experience similar side effects as adults taking cetirizine (eg, somnolence, fatigue, and dry mouth). Children, in particular, are more likely than adults to experience headaches while taking cetirizine.\n[29]\n\nIn pediatric patients aged 2 to 11, the majority of adverse reactions reported with cetirizine were mild or moderate. Somnolence appeared to be dose-related, and abdominal pain was considered treatment-related.\n\nCommon adverse drug reactions of cetirizine ophthalmic solution are conjunctival hyperemia and instillation site pain.\n[6]\n\nA few cases of transient, reversible hepatic transaminase elevations during cetirizine therapy have been reported in the literature. Some reports of hepatitis with elevated bilirubin have also been documented. In postmarketing studies, rare, potentially severe adverse events, including severe hypotension, anaphylaxis, hemolytic anemia, cholestasis, orofacial dyskinesia, glomerulonephritis, hepatitis, stillbirth, and thrombocytopenia, have been reported.\n[30]\n\nThe most common adverse reactions to ophthalmic formulations include local pain at the instillation site, ocular hyperemia, and decreased visual acuity.\n\nDrug-Drug Interactions\n\nPatients should be advised not to use cetirizine concurrently with alcohol or other CNS depressants, such as benzodiazepines or opioids, as this combination may result in dose-related sedation.\n[31]\n\nPitolisant is a histamine-3 receptor competitive antagonist and inverse agonist used in patients with narcolepsy. Concurrent use with antihistamines like cetirizine may diminish the therapeutic efficacy of pitolisant. This combination should be avoided.\n[32]\n\nCetirizine decreases gabapentin plasma concentrations and reduces systemic exposure to gabapentin. However, gabapentin is a CNS depressant. Pharmacodynamic synergism between these 2 drugs may lead to additional and observable CNS depression.\n[33]\n\nCetirizine is a substrate of P-glycoprotein, and verapamil is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. Concurrent administration of both drugs prevents the efflux of cetirizine from the CNS and increases antihistaminic activity.\n[19]\n\nCetirizine should not be administered with erdafitinib, an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (ABCB1, MDR1).\n[34]",
    "monitoring": "Patients taking cetirizine require monitoring for the relief of symptoms. Healthcare team members should also monitor patients for adverse effects such as fatigue and somnolence in adults and headaches in children.\n\nThe kidney primarily excretes cetirizine; as a result, the risk of toxicity is typically higher in patients with impaired renal function. Patients with renal impairment should take a lower medication dosage in their age bracket.\n[36]\n\nLiver function and enzymes should be closely monitored in patients with hepatic impairment. Healthcare providers should make dosage adjustments as needed for patients with hepatic impairment.\n[37]\n\nCetirizine may be confused with sertraline (look-alike-sound-alike drugs). Clinicians and pharmacists should be careful while prescribing and dispensing this drug.\n[38]",
    "toxicity": "Animal studies\n\nStudies using rat models have shown the minimal lethal dose of cetirizine to be approximately 460 times the maximum recommended daily dose for adults. The primary target of acute toxicity in rodents was the central nervous system. The primary target of multiple-dose toxicity in rodents was the liver.\n\nSigns and Symptoms of Overdose\n\nA small number of cases of cetirizine overdose appear in the literature. However, many overdoses of cetirizine in children result from improper medication storage by adults living in the same home. Most overdose incidents in children resolve spontaneously, with drowsiness and sedation being the main adverse effects observed. Drug-induced liver damage is common with numerous medications; there are reports of a small number of cases of cetirizine-induced liver damage. In all cases, liver enzyme values returned to normal after cetirizine cessation.\n[39]\nAn adult who overdosed on 150 mg cetirizine had somnolence but did not have abnormal blood chemistry, hematology results, or other clinical signs. An infant overdosed on 180 mg of cetirizine and experienced restlessness and irritability, followed by drowsiness. Several hours after an accidental overdose of cetirizine, the 6-year-old child presented with fixed and dilated pupils, tachycardia, agitation, hyperthermia, and hallucinations consistent with anticholinergic toxicity.\n[40]\n\nManagement of Overdose\n\nThere is no known specific antidote to cetirizine, and it can not be effectively removed by dialysis. When overdosed on cetirizine, treatment should be supportive and symptomatic, considering any concomitantly ingested medications.\n[41]"
