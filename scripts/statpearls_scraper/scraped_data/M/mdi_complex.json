    "indications": "Multidirectional instability (MDI) of the glenohumeral joint is a complex clinical entity characterized by symptomatic, involuntary subluxation or dislocation in 2 or more directions, typically including an inferior component.\n[1]\nThe condition, first described by Neer and Foster in 1980, highlights the delicate balance between mobility and stability in the human body's most mobile joint; a sophisticated interplay of static and dynamic stabilizers maintains this balance.\n[2]\nThe static stabilizers include the bony architecture of the glenoid and humeral head, the glenoid labrum, which deepens the socket, the capsuloligamentous complex, and the negative intra-articular pressure.\n[3]\nThe dynamic stabilizers consist of the muscles surrounding the shoulder joint, including the rotator cuff, the long head of the biceps tendon, and the periscapular musculature, which maintain stability through active concavity-compression and coordinated neuromuscular control. MDI represents a failure of this integrated system, wherein the humeral head translates beyond the physiologic boundaries of the glenoid, resulting in pain, apprehension, and functional disability.\n[4]\n\nHistorically, shoulder instability was conceptualized through a dichotomous classification system called TUBS (traumatic, unilateral, Bankart, surgical) and AMBRI (atraumatic, multidirectional, bilateral, rehabilitation, inferior capsular shift). While valuable for introducing the concept of atraumatic instability, this framework is now considered obsolete as it fails to account for the significant clinical heterogeneity and the spectrum of pathology observed in patients with MDI.\n[5]\n[6]\nA substantial portion of patients with MDI have a history of trauma, and many with traumatic instability have underlying ligamentous laxity, blurring the lines of this rigid classification.\n[6]\n[7]\n\nA modern approach, reflecting a more advanced understanding of the condition, emphasizes the underlying etiological factors.\n[5]\n[6]\nA recent systematic review proposed a more clinically relevant \"AB classification,\" which categorizes patients based on the presence or absence of (A) significant trauma and (B) generalized hyperlaxity.\n[8]\nThis framework acknowledges that MDI is not a single entity but a heterogeneous condition.\n[5]\nThis moves the clinical focus from a rigid algorithm to a patient-specific diagnosis, which better guides treatment decisions and helps standardize future research.\n[8]\nThis shift in thinking, from a simple dichotomy to a multifactorial spectrum, is fundamental to the contemporary management of MDI.\n[9]\n[10]",
    "mechanism": "The etiology of MDI can be broadly categorized into 2 primary pathways, which may exist independently or concurrently in a given patient.\n[4]\nThe first pathway is atraumatic or constitutional, from congenital or developmental factors.\n[4]\nThis is most commonly associated with generalized ligamentous hyperlaxity, a condition characterized by excessive joint mobility. This hyperlaxity can be a feature of systemic connective tissue disorders such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, or osteogenesis imperfecta, or it can be part of a benign joint hypermobility syndrome.\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\nIn these individuals, the collagen that comprises the joint capsule and ligaments is inherently more extensible, leading to a patulous and redundant capsuloligamentous complex that provides insufficient static restraint to the glenohumeral joint.\n\nThe second pathway is acquired, most often resulting from repetitive microtrauma.\n[14]\nThis is frequently observed in overhead athletes, such as swimmers, baseball pitchers, volleyball players, and gymnasts.\n[15]\nOver time, the repetitive, high-demand, end-range motions inherent to these sports gradually stretch the static capsuloligamentous stabilizers.\n[15]\nThis leads to an acquired, sport-specific capsular laxity that may not be associated with generalized hypermobility. Unlike traumatic unidirectional instability, there is typically no identifiable inciting event; the instability develops insidiously as the static restraints progressively fail.\n[3]\n\nRegardless of the initial cause, be it a congenitally lax capsule or stretched by repetitive microtrauma, the development of symptomatic MDI represents a failure of compensation.\n[16]\nMany individuals with constitutional hyperlaxity remain asymptomatic throughout their lives because their dynamic stabilizers, the rotator cuff and periscapular muscles, provide sufficient neuromuscular control to keep the humeral head centered in the glenoid.\n[16]\nMDI becomes clinically manifest only when this dynamic control system is overwhelmed, fatigued, or uncoordinated and can no longer compensate for the deficient static restraints. This concept is central to understanding both the pathophysiology of MDI and the rationale for its primary treatment, which focuses on restoring this dynamic stability.\n[16]\n[17]",
    "monitoring": "While MDI is primarily a clinical diagnosis, imaging is crucial in confirming the underlying pathology, ruling out other conditions, and guiding surgical planning when necessary.\n[4]\n[18]\n\nRadiographs and Computed Tomography\n\nThe initial imaging workup for suspected MDI includes a standard radiographic series of the shoulder, consisting of a true anteroposterior view in the scapular plane, a scapular-Y view, and an axillary lateral view.\n[18]\nIn the majority of MDI cases, these radiographs are normal.\n[34]\nTheir primary utility is to exclude other potential causes of shoulder pain and instability, such as significant glenoid bone loss (eg, a large bony Bankart lesion), glenoid dysplasia or hypoplasia, humeral head impaction fractures (Hill-Sachs lesions), or an os acromiale accessory ossicle.\n[34]\nComputed tomography is not routinely indicated for the initial diagnosis of MDI, but becomes invaluable for preoperative planning if there is suspicion of significant bony pathology.\n[35]\n[36]\nComputed tomography provides superior characterization and quantification of glenoid or humeral head bone loss, allowing for precise measurement of glenoid version, which can contribute to instability.\n[35]\n\nMagnetic Resonance Arthrography\n\nMagnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) is the imaging modality of choice for evaluating the soft-tissue structures in MDI.\n[37]\n[38]\nThe procedure involves injecting a dilute gadolinium-based contrast agent directly into the glenohumeral joint, which distends the joint capsule.\n[38]\nThis capsular distension is critical, as it separates and clearly delineates the labrum, ligaments, and capsule, allowing for a much more sensitive and specific assessment than nonarthrographic magnetic resonance imaging.\n[37]\nThe evolution of MRA has begun to shift the diagnosis of MDI from a purely subjective clinical assessment to one that is supported by objective, measurable data.\n[10]\n[27]\nThe key findings on MRA in a patient with MDI can be organized by the anatomic structures involved, including capsular, rotator interval, labral, and ligamentous pathology.\n\nCapsular Pathology\n\nThe hallmark of MDI on MRA is evidence of a globally redundant and capacious joint capsule.\n[27]\n[39]\nThis is most characteristically seen as a patulous inferior capsule and axillary recess, which appears as a large, U-shaped pouch rather than a taut, V-shaped structure.\n[40]\nThis finding is the radiological correlate of a positive clinical sulcus sign. Beyond this qualitative assessment, quantitative metrics have been developed to objectify the diagnosis. The glenocapsular (GC) ratio, calculated by dividing the capsule's cross-sectional area by the glenoid's height on a coronal image, is a particularly useful tool.\n[40]\n[41]\nResults from a study found that a GC ratio greater than 1.42 demonstrated a sensitivity of 92.3% and a specificity of 89.2% for diagnosing MDI, providing a powerful, objective measure of inferior capsular redundancy.\n[40]\n\nRotator Interval Pathology\n\nThe rotator interval, the space between the supraspinatus and subscapularis tendons containing the superior glenohumeral and coracohumeral ligaments, is frequently abnormal in MDI.\n[22]\nMRA can demonstrate widening of this interval, suggesting laxity of these important superior static restraints.\n[39]\n\nAssociated Labral and Ligamentous Pathology\n\nWhile MDI is primarily a disorder of capsular laxity, subtle or overt labral tears can coexist.\n[42]\nMRA is highly effective at identifying these lesions, which can include attenuation or fraying of the labrum, concealed tears such as a posteroinferior Kim lesion, or more extensive tears like SLAP (superior labrum anterior to posterior) lesions that may extend into the posterior labrum.\n[43]\nThe glenohumeral ligaments may appear thinned, attenuated, or stripped from their insertions.\n[38]\n[44]",
    "administration": "Treatment for individuals with MDI requires a nuanced approach that begins with recognizing the unique demands placed on the shoulder. Joint laxity may be a competitive advantage in some sports, making a standardized algorithm inappropriate. Instead, management is tailored to each patient’s goals, expectations, and functional needs. Given the complex interplay of capsular laxity, neuromuscular control, and individual factors, MDI remains challenging for clinicians and patients. Overall, the management of MDI is tailored to the individual patient, considering their symptoms, functional demands, and underlying etiology.\n[45]\nA structured, stepwise approach beginning with nonoperative management is the universally accepted standard of care.\n[16]\n[17]\n\nOverview\n\nMDI commonly develops when the balance between dynamic and static stabilizers is disrupted. Accordingly, first-line treatment centers on physical therapy that targets strengthening the dynamic stabilizers of the shoulder, particularly the rotator cuff and periscapular musculature. Closed kinetic chain exercises are emphasized to retrain co-contraction and coordinated movement, thereby improving dynamic stability. Therapy should be extensive, lasting at least 3 to 6 months, before more aggressive interventions are considered. This approach is supported by the natural stiffening of the shoulder with age, as symptoms of MDI often decrease near skeletal maturity, making prolonged rehabilitation strongly recommended.\n[21]\n[46]\n[47]\n[48]\n[49]\n[50]\n[51]\n\nRehabilitation alone is not always sufficient. Individuals with generalized hyperlaxity or entrenched maladaptive movement patterns may fail to respond to standard protocols. Recent literature highlights this complexity, suggesting that outcomes may hinge less on isolated muscle strengthening and more on how patients relearn coordinated shoulder control through movement retraining and feedback mechanisms. Hippensteel et al emphasize that rehabilitation success is closely tied to restoring neuromuscular control rather than simply targeting specific muscle groups.\n[1]\n\nPain modulation strategies are gaining increasing recognition in managing multidirectional shoulder instability. Contemporary rehabilitation programs incorporate cognitive-behavioral principles and motor control retraining, particularly for individuals with chronic symptoms. The therapeutic emphasis extends beyond traditional strengthening exercises, focusing instead on restoring efficient, unguarded movement patterns through neuromuscular re-education and cognitive engagement.\n[52]\nInterestingly, there has been a recent push toward biological surgery. Various open vs arthroscopic stabilization procedures are described in the literature. Traditional open inferior capsular shift procedures are being replaced by arthroscopic capsular plication techniques, which are less invasive and preserve more motion.\n\nThe documented long-term results of arthroscopic pancapsular shift show sustained functional improvement at 9-year follow-up.\n[19]\nStabilization procedures include capsular shift, closure of the rotator interval, and plication of redundant capsular tissue.\n[53]\nCapsular allograft reconstruction, although uncommon, has also been described for those with collagen disorders. All glenoid or labrum pathology should be addressed at the same time if they are found to contribute to the patient’s instability. Several studies have explored procedures like posterior bone block augmentation and soft tissue reinforcement in hyperlax or congenital MDI cases.\n\nA 2024 case series by Di Francia et al employed arthroscopic subscapularis augmentation with a posterior bone block and reported more than 45% improvement in Constant scores (assessing shoulder function, strength, and range of motion) and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores (evaluating pain and daily activity) at 1-year follow-up.\n[42]\nHowever, these findings are based on small series, and evidence that capsular plication consistently preserves full shoulder range of motion has not been reliably reproduced across multiple studies. A systematic review by Sahin et al acknowledged that these newer methods, although appealing, still lack long-term data.\n[54]\nSome patients, such as overhead athletes, reported subtle limitations in external rotation or difficulties returning to play.\n\nRehabilitation strategies are becoming more targeted, surgical techniques are refined, and classification systems are more thoughtful. However, each advancement brings new questions. Given the variability and patient-specific nature of MDI, a cautious and individualized approach remains essential. Innovation must be balanced with clinical judgment and adaptability.\n\nNonsurgical Management\n\nA comprehensive, supervised physical therapy program is the definitive first-line treatment for patients with MDI; this should be diligently pursued for a minimum of 3 to 6 months before considering surgical intervention.\n[3]\nWhile historical rehabilitation programs focused on generalized strengthening, modern protocols are based on a sophisticated understanding of the neuromuscular deficits in MDI.\n[22]\nThe goal is not simply to build stronger muscles but to retrain the brain and nervous system to control unstable joints.\n[8]\n[16]\n\nKey principles of MDI rehabilitation\n\nScapular stabilization\nCorrecting scapular dyskinesis is a foundational step.\n[22]\n[23]\nExercises focus on strengthening the serratus anterior, rhomboids, and lower trapezius to provide a stable base for glenohumeral motion.\n[51]\nNeuromuscular re-education and proprioception\nThe program emphasizes restoring coordinated muscle activation patterns.\n[22]\n[23]\nThis involves closed-chain exercises to promote co-contraction of the rotator cuff and deltoid and drills that challenge joint position sense.\n[22]\nPhased and progressive approach\nStructured protocols, such as the Watson Instability Program, guide patients through specific stages of treatment.\n[51]\nThe initial stages focus on establishing control of the scapular and humeral heads in low elevation ranges. Subsequent stages progressively introduce more complex, multi-planar, and functional movements, culminating in sport-specific or occupation-specific drills.\n[8]\n[16]\n[17]\n[51]\nThe success of nonoperative management is variable.\n[10]\n[27]\nMany patients achieve significant and lasting symptom relief.\n[8]\n[16]\nHowever, long-term studies indicate that a substantial minority, particularly those with more severe laxity or higher functional demands, may ultimately fail conservative care and require surgery.\n[16]\n[17]\n\nSurgical Management\n\nSurgical intervention is reserved for patients with persistent, debilitating symptoms that have failed to improve despite a compliant and comprehensive trial of nonoperative management.\n[8]\nThe fundamental goal of surgery is to reduce the pathologic capsular volume and restore appropriate tension to the static stabilizers, thereby eliminating symptomatic instability.\n[8]\n[55]\nThe historical gold standard procedure was the open inferior capsular shift, which involved a subscapularis tenotomy to expose the joint. This was followed by incising and advancing the inferior capsule superiorly to tighten it.\n[1]\n[22]\nWhile effective, this procedure has mainly been supplanted by less invasive techniques.\n\nThe current standard of care is arthroscopic pancapsular plication, also known as capsular shift. Performed through small portals, this technique allows the surgeon to systematically imbricate and suture the redundant capsular tissue from the joint's anterior, inferior, and posterior aspects, effectively tailoring the volume reduction to the patient's specific pattern of laxity. This approach avoids the morbidity of taking down the subscapularis tendon, allows for diagnosing and treating any coexisting intra-articular pathology (eg, labral tears), and is associated with a faster recovery.\n[55]\n[56]\nLong-term studies of arthroscopic pancapsular shift have demonstrated durable and significant improvements in patient-reported outcomes, with up to 82% at an 8-year follow-up.\n[19]\nDespite these excellent results, a notable portion of patients (approximately 29%) may report some residual feelings of instability, even if they are highly satisfied with their functional improvement and pain relief.\n[19]\n\nEmerging and Novel Treatment Strategies\n\nFor patients with recalcitrant MDI, particularly those with underlying connective tissue disorders or who have failed previous surgery, the future of treatment is moving beyond simply \"tightening the capsule.\" Several novel strategies target different aspects of MDI's complex pathophysiology, heralding a future of more personalized and targeted interventions.\n[44]\n\nBiological augmentation (collagen cross-linking)\n\nTargeting the material properties of the capsule itself, preclinical research is investigating the use of riboflavin and ultraviolet light to induce cross-linking within the collagen matrix of the capsule. This process has been shown to increase the biomechanical stiffness of the tissue significantly and may eventually offer a method to augment capsular integrity without surgical resection.\n[57]\n\nNeuromuscular modulation with electric muscle stimulation\n\nThe \"shoulder pacemaker\" concept utilizes neuromuscular electrical stimulation to retrain aberrant muscle firing patterns to address central neuromuscular control deficits.\n[58]\nA recent randomized controlled trial demonstrated that neuromuscular electrical stimulation-enhanced physical therapy was significantly more effective than physical therapy for patients with functional shoulder instability, suggesting a powerful new tool to augment rehabilitation.\n[47]\n[59]\n\nAdvanced ligamentous and bony reconstruction\n\nAdvanced reconstructive options are being developed for the most severe and complex cases. Coracohumeral ligament reconstruction, using a tendon allograft or autograft, has been described as a salvage procedure for patients with a persistently incompetent rotator interval and inferior instability after failed primary surgery.\n[8]\nIn rare instances of MDI associated with congenital glenoid hypoplasia or significant bone deficiency, bone-based augmentation procedures using bone blocks can be employed to enhance static stability by increasing the depth and surface area of the glenoid.\n[5]\nThese emerging therapies represent a critical shift in the field. Rather than relying on a one-size-fits-all approach, future treatments evolve toward highly individualized strategies tailored to each patient’s specific pathology, whether rooted in tissue quality, neuromuscular control, or structural deficiency.\n[60]",
    "adverse_effects": "Most complications associated with MDI are related to its surgical treatment.\n[61]\nWhile relatively uncommon, potential complications include:\n\nPostoperative stiffness\nOvertightening of the capsule during a plication procedure can result in a significant loss of motion, particularly in external rotation. This is the most common complication and can be challenging to manage.\n[62]\nRecurrence of instability\nDespite surgical tightening, some patients may experience a recurrence of their instability, particularly those with underlying collagen disorders or who return to high-demand activities prematurely.\n[63]\nRecurrence of instability was commonly seen following thermal capsulorrhaphy as it induced irreparable damage to the shoulder capsule. For this reason, thermal capsulorrhaphy has fallen out of favor and is now only mentioned for historical purposes.\n[64]\n[65]\nNerve injury\nThe axillary nerve is at risk during dissection around the inferior aspect of the glenohumeral joint, particularly during open procedures. Injury can result in deltoid weakness and sensory loss.\nPostcapsulorrhaphy arthritis\nHistorically, overly aggressive tightening procedures were associated with increased joint reaction forces, leading to accelerated chondral wear and glenohumeral arthritis.\n[62]\nCapsulorrhaphy-induced arthritis was commonly seen following Magnuson-Stack or Putti-Platte procedures, which dramatically tightened the capsule and compressed the humeral head into the glenoid, effectively increasing the rate of cartilage degeneration. Modern, more anatomic techniques have reduced this risk.\nSubscapularis deficiency\nThis is a specific complication of open capsular shift procedures that require taking down and repairing the subscapularis tendon. Failure of the tendon to heal can lead to significant weakness and dysfunction.\n[62]\nThis complication is avoided mainly with arthroscopic techniques."
