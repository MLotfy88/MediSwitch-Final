    "indications": "Box Warnings\n\nAlmotriptan is contraindicated in patients with renal dysfunction or insufficiency and with advanced age due to a physiological decrease in renal function and renal clearance with advanced age.\n[15]\n\nMinor almotriptan clearance occurs through the CYP450 system (specifically, CYP3A4); therefore, the clinician should avoid other drugs metabolized through this pathway because they may decrease almotriptan clearance. These drugs include but are not limited to verapamil, nifedipine, losartan, cyclosporine, and moclobemide.\n[15]\nPatients with reduced enzyme activity should be cautious in dosing the drug.\n\nWarnings and Precautions\n\nContraindications to almotriptan include patients with underlying cardiovascular disease due to the presence of 5HT1B receptors in the coronary arteries. Almotriptan potentially binds to such receptors, further narrowing the arteries or spasms.\n[18]\nPatients with hypersensitivity to almotriptan should not use the drug, nor should patients with a history of a hemiplegic or basilar migraine or a heart condition. Moreover, this medication is not used in patients with cerebrovascular syndromes, peripheral vascular disease, or high blood pressure. Caution is necessary if dosing almotriptan within 24 hours of using a serotonin agonist or an ergotamine class medication due to the vasoconstrictive effects of both drugs.\n[20]",
    "mechanism": "Mechanism of Action\n\nAlmotriptan is a selective serotonin agonist on the 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors in the cranial arteries. Activation of the 5HT receptors is associated with reducing neurogenic inflammation, which researchers hypothesize to be involved in the migraine relief process.\n\nPharmacokinetics\n\nAlmotriptan narrows the brain's blood vessels, reduces cerebral blood flow, and reduces the transmission of pain signals to the brain.\n[14]\n\nAbsorption\n\nThe drug has a relatively short half-life of 3 hours, and the oral bioavailability was 69.1%.\n[15]\nThe currently available oral delivery system of almotriptan has limited bioavailability because of poor aqueous solubility. To improve the solubility of almotriptan, researchers have created a buccal delivery system for almotriptan, which was tested in a rabbit model.\n[16]\nThe buccal delivery system demonstrated greater absorption when compared to the current oral delivery system\n\nDistribution, Metabolism, Elimination\n\nAlmotriptan is excreted in the urine and metabolized predominantly by the cytochrome CYP450 system.\n[15]\nCompared with earlier generation triptans such as sumatriptan, almotriptan has a higher oral bioavailability and a shorter plasma half-life.\n[14]",
    "administration": "Adult Dosage\n\nThe recommended oral dose of almotriptan is 12.5 mg to treat acute migraine attacks in adults and adolescents effectively.\n[15]\nThe dose may be repeated after 2 hours if a headache returns. More than 2 doses or 25 mg/d is not recommended. Studies have also shown that almotriptan has a synergistic effect when combined with aceclofenac 100 mg to treat an acute migraine attack.\n[3]\n\nFood intake does not affect the absorption of almotriptan.\n[15]\n\nRenal Impairment\n\nDosing adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency.\n\nHepatic Impairment\n\nDosing adjustment is necessary when the drug is used with cytochrome P450 inducers (eg, phenytoin, phenobarbital) and cytochrome P450 inhibitors (eg, certain antimicrobials, grapefruit juice, ketoconazole, protease inhibitors).",
    "adverse_effects": "The common adverse effects of almotriptan are drowsiness, dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, and fatigue.\n[17]\nThe drug is associated with a similar incidence of nausea or vomiting compared to other classes of triptans (eg, sumatriptan). However, it shows a decreased incidence of common adverse effects, especially compared to first-generation triptans.\n[14]\n[17]\n\nAlmotriptan binds to 5HT1B receptors, which are present in the coronary arteries. The administration may result in coronary artery narrowing or spasms, leading to potential coronary artery vasospasm or myocardial infarction.\n[18]\nSome rare side effects of almotriptan include pulmonary vasoconstriction, serotonin syndrome, and inhibition of trigeminal nerves.\n[19]\n[20]",
    "monitoring": "Patients prescribed almotriptan should be monitored for the presence of side effects and response to therapy. Kidney function should be monitored when taking the drug as renal clearance may affect the overall drug clearance from the body, causing toxicity. Regular blood pressure monitoring should occur at each clinical visit due to the narrowing effect of the 5-HT1B receptors on the blood vessels to assess the drug's effectiveness.\n[20]",
    "toxicity": "There are no associated toxicities with almotriptan due to the limited data, although studies demonstrate increased preterm birth rates in pregnant women who were prescribed triptans for migraine relief.\n[21]\n\nAn analysis of several case reports of patients undergoing dual triptan-SSRI/SNRI, eg, fluoxetine and venlafaxine therapy or triptan monotherapy, suggested adding triptans to SSRI/SNRI therapy does not necessarily increase patients' risk of developing serotonin syndrome. However, clinicians should remain cautious and vigilant of the symptoms.\n[22]"
