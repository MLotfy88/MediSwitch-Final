Serotonin syndrome is a rare but serious and potentially fatal condition thought to result from hyperstimulation of brainstem 5-HT1A and 2A receptors. Symptoms of the serotonin syndrome may include mental status changes such as irritability, altered consciousness, confusion, hallucinations, and coma; autonomic dysfunction such as tachycardia, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, shivering, blood pressure lability, and mydriasis; neuromuscular abnormalities such as hyperreflexia, myoclonus, tremor, rigidity, and ataxia; and gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Since many serotonergic agents can also cause central nervous system depression, concomitant use with opioids may result in increased sedation and impairment of judgment, thinking, and psychomotor skills.",
      "management_text": "Caution is advised when opioids are used concomitantly with serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), other antidepressants/psychotropic agents (e.g., amoxapine, buspirone, lithium, maprotiline, mirtazepine, nefazodone, trazodone, vilazodone), 5-HT1 receptor agonists (triptans), 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, cyclobenzaprine, dextromethorphan, 5-hydroxytryptophan, and St. John's wort. Patients should be monitored for symptoms of the serotonin syndrome during treatment. If serotonin syndrome develops or is suspected during the course of therapy, all serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately and supportive care rendered as necessary.",

These drugs may increase the risk of hypoglycemia by enhancing insulin sensitivity (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, fibrates, ginseng); stimulating insulin secretion (salicylates, disopyramide, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, quinidine, quinine, MAOIs, ginseng); decreasing insulin clearance and resistance (4-aminoquinolines); increasing peripheral glucose utilization (SSRIs, insulin-like growth factor); inhibiting gluconeogenesis (SSRIs, MAOIs, insulin-like growth factor); slowing the rate of gastric emptying (amylin analogs); and/or suppressing postprandial glucagon secretion (amylin analogs). Clinical hypoglycemia has been reported during use of some of these agents alone or with insulin and/or insulin secretagogues.",

Electrophysiological testing may be performed at baseline and every six months during therapy to detect asymptomatic neuropathy. Consideration should be given to immediate discontinuation of thalidomide in patients who develop peripheral neuropathy to limit further damage. Symptoms may improve or return to baseline in some patients upon discontinuation of thalidomide, although the complete time course of this toxicity has not been fully characterized. Because bradycardia is a risk factor for torsade de pointes arrhythmia, caution is advised when thalidomide is used with drugs that can prolong the QT interval or induce torsade de pointes arrhythmia.

Baseline and regular monitoring of hepatic function is recommended. Thioguanine therapy should be discontinued if there is evidence of toxic hepatitis or biliary stasis, as reversal of signs and symptoms of liver toxicity have been reported upon withdrawal.
