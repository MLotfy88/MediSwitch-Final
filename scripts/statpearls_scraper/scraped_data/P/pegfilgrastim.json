    "indications": "Pegfilgrastim can cause hypersensitivity reactions.\n[22]\nTherefore, it is contraindicated for patients with a history of sensitivity to pegfilgrastim, filgrastim, or any formulation component. The additional warnings and precautions as per labeling are given below.\n\nWarnings and Precautions\n\nSplenic rupture:\nLeft upper quadrant or shoulder pain with splenomegaly may be observed. Splenic rupture may occur following pegfilgrastim administration.\n[23]\n[24]\n\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS):\nARDS can occur in patients receiving pegfilgrastim. ARDS should be considered if patients exhibit fever, lung infiltrates, or respiratory distress after pegfilgrastim administration. Discontinue pegfilgrastim if ARDS is confirmed. Rare cases of interstitial pneumonia have been reported.\n[25]\n\nSevere allergic reactions:\nThe first dose of pegfilgrastim can cause severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Discontinue pegfilgrastim permanently in patients who experience severe allergic reactions and avoid its use in patients with a history of severe allergic reactions to pegfilgrastim or filgrastim.\n\nSickle cell disorders:\nPegfilgrastim can induce severe, potentially fatal sickle cell crises in patients with sickle cell disease. Discontinue pegfilgrastim if a sickle cell crisis occurs.\n[26]\n\nGlomerulonephritis:\nSome patients receiving pegfilgrastim may develop glomerulonephritis, with signs like azotemia, hematuria, and proteinuria. Consider stopping the pegfilgrastim in glomerulonephritis.\n\nThrombocytopenia:\nThrombocytopenia can occur; clinicians must monitor platelet counts.\n\nCapillary leak syndrome:\nSystemic capillary leak syndrome (SCLS) is caused by increased capillary permeability to proteins. Fluid extravasation from the blood vessels leads to hypotension, pleural effusion, anasarca, and pericardial effusion. Severe cases of SCLS may cause multiorgan dysfunction, cardiovascular collapse, shock, and death. Close monitoring and appropriate treatment, including possible intensive care, are essential.\n[27]\n[28]\n\nAortitis:\nAortitis can occur during the initial phase of pegfilgrastim therapy. Discontinue pegfilgrastim if aortitis is suspected.\n[29]\n[30]\n[31]\n\nMyelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia:\nPegfilgrastim with chemotherapy/radiotherapy increases the risk of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Clinicians must monitor these patients for MDS or AML.\n[32]\n[33]",
    "mechanism": "Pegfilgrastim is the long-acting form of filgrastim, a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Pegfilgrastim has a polyethylene glycol molecule covalently bound to it, resulting in prolonged action duration. This medication helps prevent febrile neutropenia by increasing the body's neutrophil level and inducing neutrophil proliferation, differentiation, and maturation. Pegfilgrastim also enhances the survival of mature neutrophils.\n[9]\n\nPharmacokinetics\n\nAbsorption:\nSubcutaneous pegfilgrastim has a lower absolute bioavailability compared to filgrastim. The drug's absorption is primarily mediated through the lymphatic system due to the PEG group attached to the molecule, which increases its size. As a result, pegfilgrastim is slowly absorbed, with peak concentrations typically occurring 1 to 2 days after subcutaneous administration.\n\nDistribution:\nThe volume of distribution is approximately 170 L.\n\nMetabolism:\nPegfilgrastim is internalized by the neutrophil and subsequently undergoes nonspecific degradation.\n\nExcretion:\nPegfilgrastim's serum clearance is 14 mL/h/kg. Pegfilgrastim is formed by conjugating a polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety to filgrastim, resulting in a larger molecule. This modification reduces renal clearance via glomerular filtration, making neutrophil-mediated clearance the primary elimination route. The dosage and the absolute neutrophil count influence the clearance of pegfilgrastim. In patients with neutropenia, the drug's biological activity is prolonged due to the reduced availability of mature neutrophils to clear it from circulation.\n[10]",
    "administration": "Available Dosage Forms and Strengths\n\nPegfilgrastim has specific administration instructions for both the prevention of febrile neutropenia and the hematopoietic sub-syndrome known as acute radiation syndrome.\n\nPegfilgrastim has 2 administration options: one is a prefilled syringe, and the other is an on-body injector.\n[11]\nThe pegfilgrastim prefilled syringe and on-body injector are typically given on the back of the upper arm or the abdomen, at least 2 inches from the navel. When receiving pegfilgrastim in the prefilled syringe, the patient must make an extra trip to a healthcare facility for subcutaneous administration by a healthcare professional. With the on-body injector, the patient can have it administered the day of their chemotherapy regimen before leaving the clinic, improving patient satisfaction and compliance.\n\nThe healthcare professional fills the on-body injector with the pegfilgrastim dose immediately before applying it to the patient's skin. Once filled with the medication, the unit activates automatically. The on-body injector deploys a needle 3 minutes after activation, which the healthcare provider inserts into the patient subcutaneously. The device is then attached to the patient via its adhesive backing. The pegfilgrastim dose is not injected into the patient until 27 hours after activation. Following administration, the patient may appropriately discard the on-body injector.\n[12]\n\nAdult Dosage\n\nMyelosuppressive chemotherapy:\nTo prevent febrile neutropenia, a 6 mg pegfilgrastim dose is given to the patient at least 24 hours after receiving chemotherapy.\n[3]\nThe patient should also receive pegfilgrastim with the first dose of chemotherapy, and administrations should continue throughout their subsequent chemotherapy cycles. Pegfilgrastim should not be given to children under 45 kg because they require weight-based dosing. Since the prefilled syringe and on-body injector both administer precisely 6 mg of pegfilgrastim and have no marks for measuring, they should not be used for patients who require weight-based dosing.\n[3]\n\nAcute radiation syndrome:\nTo prevent acute radiation syndrome, the recommended dose of pegfilgrastim is 2 doses of 6 mg each, and they should be administered 1 week apart after the patient has undergone radiation exposure therapy.\n[6]\n\nSpecific Patient Populations\n\nHepatic impairment:\nNo dosage adjustments are specified in the product labeling; research is required.\n\nRenal impairment:\nNo dosage adjustment is necessary in cases of renal impairment.\n[9]\nPegfilgrastim may cause glomerulonephritis with acute kidney injury. Milder cases might be overlooked; routine renal function and urinalysis are essential.\n[13]\n\nPregnancy considerations:\nThere is limited data on the use of pegfilgrastim in pregnant women to assess the risk of congenital disabilities, miscarriage, or adverse outcomes for the mother or fetus. However, filgrastim use during pregnancy has not been linked to significant congenital disabilities, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal effects. International consensus suggests that using granulocyte growth factors is likely safe, although data remain limited.\n[14]\n\nBreastfeeding considerations:\nFilgrastim, a recombinant G-CSF, and pegfilgrastim are minimally excreted into breast milk, with levels becoming undetectable within 3 days after injection. Withholding breastfeeding for up to 3 days post-injection is an option. However, the effects of filgrastim or pegfilgrastim on lactation and infant health have not been fully established. Caution and counseling of the mother regarding risk and benefit are recommended due to the limited data.\n[15]\n\nPediatric patients:\nThe dose of pegfilgrastim for pediatric patients is based on weight. Caution and close monitoring are advised. The subcutaneous doses for children based on weight ranges are listed below.\n\n<10 kg: 0.1 mg/kg\n10 to 20 kg: 1.5 mg\n21 to 30 kg: 2.5 mg\n31 to 44 kg: 4 mg\n≥45 kg: 6 mg\n\nOlder patients:\nNo differences in safety and efficacy have been observed compared to younger patients. Studies show that pegfilgrastim reduces hospitalizations from neutropenia by approximately 50%.\n[16]",
    "adverse_effects": "The most common adverse effect experienced with pegfilgrastim is bone pain. Bone pain associated with pegfilgrastim may be managed with analgesics, such as acetaminophen or NSAIDs, which remain first-line options per ASCO guidelines.\n[17]\nNSAIDs may not be an appropriate option for pain relief in some patient populations, such as older adults or those with kidney disease. Although some studies, including the NOLAN phase 2 trial, have explored the use of loratadine for preventing bone pain, it is not recommended by ASCO.\n[18]\n\nDrug-Drug Interactions\n\nClozapine:\nClozapine has the potential to induce neutropenia and agranulocytosis, whereas granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) promotes the production of neutrophils. When administered concurrently, G-CSF may mitigate the neutropenic effects associated with clozapine, necessitating careful monitoring.\n[19]\nWhen pegfilgrastim is used with drugs that cause neutropenia, the absolute neutrophil count should be monitored.\n[20]\n\nExagamglogene:\nGranulocyte colony-stimulating factor should be used cautiously after day 21 to aid neutrophil recovery following myeloablative conditioning. This promotes safe immune system reconstitution to maintain the efficacy of exagamglogene in sickle cell disease.\n[21]",
    "monitoring": "Since pegfilgrastim works on neutrophils to prevent febrile neutropenia, it is imperative to monitor the patient's complete blood count throughout the treatment regimen, with particular attention given to the white blood cell count.\n[17]\nPegfilgrastim has been shown to cause leukocytosis, so it is essential to monitor for elevated white blood cell counts exceeding 11,000/mm\n3\n.\n[34]\nPegfilgrastim and all other granulocyte colony-stimulating factors can also cause capillary leak syndrome. Therefore, it is vital to monitor for signs of capillary leak syndrome, which include hypotension, edema, and hypoalbuminemia.\n[35]\nMonitoring the patient's temperature to detect the potential onset of febrile neutropenia is also critical.\n[17]",
    "toxicity": "Signs and Symptoms of Overdose\n\nThe maximum safe dose of pegfilgrastim has not been established. The highest dose studied in clinical trials is 300 μg/kg. There have been instances of accidental overdoses occurring in patients. In one case, the patient was a 79-year-old man who self-administered pegfilgrastim for 8 days in a row. He experienced no symptoms during this time but was monitored closely by his doctor 3 times a week, during which he only complained of bone pain. In another case, the patient was a 69-year-old man who self-administered a 36 mg overdose of pegfilgrastim. He was admitted to the hospital, where clinical staff observed leukocytosis, bone pain, and rhinorrhea. Due to the current lack of appropriate treatment for pegfilgrastim overdose, the best course of action for overdose is prevention by vigilant monitoring for signs and symptoms of toxicity.\n[36]\n\nManagement of Overdose\n\nThere is no antidote for pegfilgrastim.\n[37]\nEmergency medicine physicians should provide supportive care. Consult a medical toxicologist or the National Poison Control Center for complicated cases or pediatric patients.\n[38]"
