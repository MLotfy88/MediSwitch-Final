[Paliperidone], another commonly used SGA, is the primary active metabolite of risperidone (i.e. 9-hydroxyrisperidone).[L12885]

Schizophrenia and various mood disorders are thought to be caused by an excess of dopaminergic D2 and serotonergic 5-HT2A activity, resulting in overactivity of central mesolimbic pathways and mesocortical pathways, respectively. Risperidone is thought to reduce this overactivity through inhibition of dopaminergic D2 receptors and serotonergic 5-HT2A receptors in the brain.[L12885]

Risperidone binds with a very high affinity to 5-HT2A receptors, approximately 10-20 fold greater than the drug''s binding affinity to D2 receptors, and carries lesser activity at several off-targets which may responsible for some of its undesirable effects.[L12885]','["N05AX08"]','[]'),(10431,'Aaa','ششش','30','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',877,'2022-12-08',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10435,'Sigmacortin 500mg pd. for i.m./i.v.','سيجماكورتين 500مجم باودر فيال','34','','Glucocorticoid','Hydrocortisone sodium succinate','Sigma','Unknown','غير محدد','500mg','1','','','6221172002034','',1166,'2022-12-08',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10436,'Sigmataxim 500mg i.v. / i.m. vial','سيجماتاكسيم 500مجم فيال','14','','Antibiotic.cephalosporin.third-generation','Cefotaxime','Rameda > sigma','Vial','فيال','500mg','1','','','6221172002287','',784,'2023-04-11',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Cefotaxime is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic.

More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Simvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] Increasing use of the statin class of drugs is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, [rosuvastatin] is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg [rosuvastatin] per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels, while simvastatin has been found to have an average decrease in LDL-C of ~35%.[A181409,A181535,A181538,A1793] Potency is thought to correlate to tissue permeability as the more lipophilic statins such as simvastatin are thought to enter endothelial cells by passive diffusion, as opposed to hydrophilic statins such as [pravastatin] and [rosuvastatin] which are taken up into hepatocytes through OATP1B1 (organic anion transporter protein 1B1)-mediated transport.[A181424,A181460] Despite these differences in potency, several trials have demonstrated only minimal differences in terms of clinical outcomes between statins.[A181427]','["A10BH51", "C10AA01", "C10BX04", "C10BA02", "C10BX01", "C10BA04"]','[]');

It is a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). Penile erection is a hemodynamic process initiated by the relaxation of smooth muscle in the corpus cavernosum and its associated arterioles. During sexual stimulation, nitric oxide is released from nerve endings and endothelial cells in the corpus cavernosum. Nitric oxide activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase resulting in increased synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the smooth muscle cells of the corpus cavernosum. The cGMP in turn triggers smooth muscle relaxation, allowing increased blood flow into the penis, resulting in erection. The tissue concentration of cGMP is regulated by both the rates of synthesis and degradation via phosphodiesterases (PDEs). The most abundant PDE in the human corpus cavernosum is the cGMPspecific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5); therefore, the inhibition of PDE5 enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP.','["G04BE09"]','[]'),(10685,'Aaa','ششش','7','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','0','','','','',682,'2022-12-03',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10687,'Solvin 80mg/100ml syrup 120ml','سولفين 80مجم/100مل شراب 120 مل','6','','Mucolytic','Bromhexine+ipeca tincture+senega extract+tolu syrup','Arab drug company.','Syrup','شراب','80mg','1','','','6221060003266','',1210,'2023-01-05',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'R05CA06',NULL),(10688,'Solvin 2mg/ml oral drops 15 ml','سولفين 2مجم/مل نقط للفم 15مل','14','5.5','Mucolytic','Bromhexine','Arab drug company.','Sol','محلول','2mg','1','','','6221060001354','',1462,'2025-10-25',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'R05CB02',NULL),(10689,'Aaa','ششش','7','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','0','','','','',831,'2023-01-05',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10690,'Solvinal 10 sachets eff','سولفينال 10 اكياس فوار','5','','Antigout.analgesic','Atropine sulphate+colchicine+piperazine','Memphis','Sol','محلول','','1','علاج حالات املاح حمض اليوريك','','6221050070063','',2138,'2023-01-05',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10695,'Aaa','ششش','190','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','0','','','','',664,'2023-04-27',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10696,'Somatropin 4 i.u./ vial','سوماتروبين 4وحدة دولية / فيال','321','228','Human growth hormone','Somatropin','Sedico','Vial','فيال','','1','هرمون نمو بشري','','6221042593402','',16499,'2024-07-07',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'H01AC',NULL),(10698,'Somazina supra 100mg/ml oral drops 30 ml','سومازينا سوبرا 100مجم/مل نقط للفم 30 مل','250','210','Cerebral circulatory inhancer','Citicholine','October pharma > ferrer international sa -spain','Drops','نقط','100mg','1','لتحفيز الدورة الدموية بالمخ','citicoline is a brain chemical that occurs naturally in the body. as a medicine it is taken by mouth as a supplement or given by iv or as a shot. citicoline is used for alzheimer s disease and other types of dementia head trauma cerebrovascular disease su','6224009165285','',8201,'2025-11-09',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL);

The result of doing so allows cGMP present in both the penis and pulmonary vasculature to elicit smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation that subsequently facilitates relief in pulmonary arterial hypertension and the increased flow of blood into the spongy erectile tissue of the penis that consequently allows it to grow in size and become erect and rigid [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

Interestingly enough, it is precisely via this mechanism why sildenafil was at first researched as a potential treatment for angina - or chest pain associated with inadequate blood flow to the heart - before being serendipitously indicated for treating erectile dysfunction in the late 1980s [A175732]. Nevertheless, it is because of this mechanism that sildenafil is also indicated for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension but is also additionally notorious for interacting with various anti-anginal or anti-hypertensive agents to develop potentially rapid, excessive, and/or fatal hypotensive crises [A175579, A175582, A175654].

Regardless, sildenafil, among a variety of other similar or related PDE5 inhibitors, has become a common and effective treatment for erectile dysfunction and since its formal approval for medical use in the public in 1998 [A175732], continues to see millions of prescriptions written for it internationally. Although the medication has historically been most popularly recognized as Pfizer''s brand name Viagra, sildenafil is currently available generically and even as a non-prescription over the counter medication in some countries [L5656].','["G01AE10", "G04BE03"]','[]'),(10802,'Spiramycin 1.5 m.i.u. 10 tab.','سبيراميسين 1.5 مليون وحدة دولية 10 قرص','20','','Antibiotic.macrolide','Spiramycin','Pharopharma','Tab','أقراص','','1','مضاد حيوي','about spiramycin macrolide antibiotic antibacterial (systemic antiprotozoal in toxoplasmosis cryptosporidiosis. mechanism of action of spiramycin spiramycin is a member of macrolide antibiotic. it binds to the 50s sub unit of bacterial ribosome and inhibi','6221094077219','',1370,'2022-12-09',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'J01FA02',NULL),(10803,'Spiramycin 3 m.i.u. 10 tab.','سيبراميسين 3م.و.د 10اقراص','42','','Antibiotic.macrolide','Spiramycin','Pharopharma','Tab','أقراص','','1','مضاد حيوي','about spiramycin macrolide antibiotic antibacterial (systemic antiprotozoal in toxoplasmosis cryptosporidiosis. mechanism of action of spiramycin spiramycin is a member of macrolide antibiotic. it binds to the 50s sub unit of bacterial ribosome and inhibi','6221094077233','',1558,'2022-12-09',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'J01FA02',NULL),(10804,'Spirazole 20 tab.','سبيرازول 20 قرص','50','21.75','Antibiotic.macrolide.combined with nitroimidazoles','Metronidazole+spiramycin','Pharopharma','Tab','أقراص','','2','','pregnancy related information use with caution. breast feeding related information contraindicated indications for metronidazole + spiramycin 1.dental abscess 2.cellulites of the jaw 3.pericoronitis 4.gingivitis 5.stomatitis 6.parotitis 7.submaxillaritis','6221094077257','',1264,'2024-12-11',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10805,'Aaa','ششش','22','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',763,'2022-10-15',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10806,'Spirazole forte 20 tab.','سبيرازول فورت 20 قرص','142','36','Antibiotic.macrolide.combined with nitroimidazoles','Metronidazole+spiramycin','Pharopharma','Tab','أقراص','','2','','pregnancy related information use with caution. breast feeding related information contraindicated indications for metronidazole + spiramycin 1.dental abscess 2.cellulites of the jaw 3.pericoronitis 4.gingivitis 5.stomatitis 6.parotitis 7.submaxillaritis','6221094077240','',2332,'2024-12-11',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10808,'Aaa','ششش','32','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',738,'2022-06-04',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10811,'Aaa','ششش','21','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',729,'2022-08-14',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10813,'Spiriva 18mcg 30 inh. caps.+handihaler','سبيريفا 18مكجم 30 كبسولة + جهاز','416','403.25','Bronchodilator','Tiotropium bromide','Boehringer ingelheim','Cap','كبسولة','18mcg','3','','','4048846000507','',1251,'2022-12-09',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'R03AL06',NULL),(10814,'Azithrochidia 1% eye drops 15*0.4ml sdu','ازيثرو كيديا 1% قطرة عين 15*0.4 مل وحدات مفردة','66','45','Antibiotic.macrolide','Azithromycin','Orchidia','Drops','نقط','1%','1','','','','',928,'2025-08-04',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Azithromycin is a broad-spectrum macrolide antibiotic with a long half-life and a high degree of tissue penetration [A174172].

It is primarily used for the treatment of respiratory, enteric and genitourinary infections and may be used instead of other macrolides for some sexually transmitted and enteric infections. It is structurally related to erythromycin [A174169].

Azithromycin [9-deoxo-9a-aza-9a-methyl-9a-homoerythromycin] is a part of the _azalide_ subclass of macrolides, and contains a 15-membered ring, with a methyl-substituted nitrogen instead of a carbonyl group at the 9a position on the aglycone ring, which allows for the prevention of its metabolism. This differentiates azithromycin from other types of macrolides [A174175].

In March 2020, a small study was funded by the French government to investigate the treatment of COVID-19 with a combination of azithromycin and the anti-malaria drug [hydroxychloroquine]. The results were positive, all patients taking the combination were virologically cured within 6 days of treatment, however, larger studies are required.[A192546]','["J01RA07", "S01AA26", "J01FA10"]','[]'),(10816,'Spironolactone (delta) 100mg 20 tab.','سبيرونولاكتون 100مجم 20 قرص','17','','Diuretic.potassium-sparing diuretics','Spironolactone','Global napi pharmaceuticals > al delta pharmaceuticals trading co.','Tab','أقراص','100mg','2','','about spironolactone selective aldosterone antagonist antiandrogen potassium-sparing diuretic. mechanism of action of spironolactone spironolactone is a steroid with structural similarity to aldosterone which exerts it`s pharmacological actions by acting','','',2980,'2022-10-18',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Spironolactone is a potassium sparing diuretic like [eplerenone] that competitively inhibits mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal convoluted tubule to promote sodium and water excretion and potassium retention.[A11837] Spironolactone was originally developed purely for this ability before other pharmacodynamic properties of the drug were discovered.[A11837,A178246] It is indicated to treat a number of conditions including heart failure, deem, hyperaldosteronism, adrenal hyperplasia, hypertension, and nephrotic syndrome.[Label] Off label uses of spironolactone involving its antiandrogenic activity include hirsutism, female pattern hair loss, and adult acne vulgaris.[A178135] Spironolactone is also frequently used in medical gender transition.[A178138]

As of the end of 1995, more than 10 million patients worldwide have been treated with fluvoxamine.','["N06AB08"]','[]'),(10875,'Lezberg trio 40/10/25mg 30 f.c.tabs.','ليزبيرج تريو 40/10/25مجم 30 قرص','162','123','Anti-hypertensive.combined angiotensin blocker & ca++ channel blocker & diuretic','Amlodipine+olmesartan+hydrochlorothiazide','Global advanced pharmaceuticals (gap)','Tab','أقراص','25mg','3','','','6223005941282','',1211,'2025-08-04',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10876,'Ojera - skin emollient 50 gm cream','اوجيرا كريم ملطف للجلد 50 جم','45','','Skin emollient& moisturizing cream','Tea tree oil+honey+panthenol+vit. e+olive oil+beeswax','Merk share','Cream','كريم','50 gm','1','','','','',918,'2024-06-15',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10877,'Meladodo 3mg 30 tabs','ميلادودو 3مجم 30 قرص','270','245','Sleep aid','Melatonin','Masenz danya group','Tab','أقراص','3mg','3','','','','',796,'2025-04-06',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Melatonin is a biogenic amine that is found in animals, plants and microbes. Aaron B. Lerner of Yale University is credited for naming the hormone and for defining its chemical structure in 1958.  In mammals, melatonin is produced by the pineal gland. The pineal gland is small endocrine gland, about the size of a rice grain and shaped like a pine cone (hence the name), that is located in the center of the brain (rostro-dorsal to the superior colliculus) but outside the blood-brain barrier. The secretion of melatonin increases in darkness and decreases during exposure to light, thereby regulating the circadian rhythms of several biological functions, including the sleep-wake cycle. In particular, melatonin regulates the sleep-wake cycle by chemically causing drowsiness and lowering the body temperature.  Melatonin is also implicated in the regulation of mood, learning and memory, immune activity, dreaming, fertility and reproduction. Melatonin is also an effective antioxidant.  Most of the actions of melatonin are mediated through the binding and activation of melatonin receptors. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may have lower than normal levels of melatonin. A 2008 study found that unaffected parents of individuals with ASD also have lower melatonin levels, and that the deficits were associated with low activity of the ASMT gene, which encodes the last enzyme of melatonin synthesis. Reduced melatonin production has also been proposed as a likely factor in the significantly higher cancer rates in night workers.','["N05CH01"]','[]');

Ergocalciferol was isolated for the first time from yeast in 1931 and its structure was elucidated in 1932.[T580]

Ergocalciferol is considered the first vitamin D analog and is differentiated from [cholecalciferol] by the presence of a double bond between C22 and C23 and the presence of a methyl group at C24. These modifications reduce the affinity of ergocalciferol for the vitamin D binding protein resulting in faster clearance, limits its activation, and alters its catabolism.[A177637]

TCAs are structurally similar to phenothiazines. They contain a tricyclic ring system with an alkyl amine substituent on the central ring. In non-depressed individuals, clomipramine does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. In depressed individuals, clomipramine exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Tertiary amine TCAs, such as clomipramine, are more potent inhibitors of serotonin reuptake than secondary amine TCAs, such as nortriptyline and desipramine. TCAs also down-regulate cerebral cortical β-adrenergic receptors and sensitize post-synaptic serotonergic receptors with chronic use. The antidepressant effects of TCAs are thought to be due to an overall increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. TCAs also block histamine-H1receptors, α1-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively. See toxicity section below for a complete listing of side effects. Clomipramine may be used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder and disorders with an obsessive-compulsive component (e.g. depression, schizophrenia, Tourette’s disorder).

Oseltamivir exerts its antiviral activity by inhibiting the activity of the viral neuraminidase enzyme found on the surface of the virus, which prevents budding from the host cell, viral replication, and infectivity.

The clinical benefit of use of oseltamivir is greatest when administered within 48 hours of the onset of influenza symptoms since effectiveness decreases significantly after that point in time; there is generally no benefit in use beyond 48 hours for healthy, low-risk individuals as influenza is a self-limiting illness.[A180574, L7267, A180580] However, antiviral treatment might be beneficial when initiated after 48 hours for patients with severe, complicated or progressive illness or for hospitalized patients.[A180583] According to the CDC, data from clinical trials and observational studies have demonstrated that early antiviral treatment can shorten the duration of fever and illness symptoms, and may reduce the risk of some complications (including pneumonia and respiratory failure). They recommend the use of oseltamivir in people with a higher risk of developing complications including children younger than 2 years, people over 65 years, people with some chronic conditions or immunosuppression, pregnant women, residents of long term care facilities, and indigenous communities for example.[L7264]

The benefits of oseltamivir use are controversial; a 2014 Cochrane Review of the evidence found that oseltamivir treatment had limited benefit. The authors concluded that oseltamivir use in healthy adults had small, non-specific effects on symptoms (where the time to first alleviation of symptoms was only reduced from 7 to 6.3 days), it had no effect on hospitalizations, and that there was no evidence for any reductions in complications of influenza such as pneumonia.[A179962, A179965, A179968] Due to the risk of adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, psychiatric effects and renal adverse events in adults and vomiting in children, the harms are generally considered to outweigh the small clinical benefit of use of oseltamivir. 

Notably, in 2017, the World Health Organization downgraded oseltamivir from its essential medicines list from a "core" drug to a "complementary" drug, due to limited cost-effectiveness.[A179086] Yearly vaccination with the influenza vaccine is still considered the best preventative measure.','["J05AH02"]','[]'),(11150,'Tamol 100mg/ml oral drops 10 ml','تامول 100مجم/مل نقط فم 10 مل','9','','Analgesics.narcotic opioid','Tramadol','Marcyrl co.','Drops','نقط','100mg','1','مسكن للألام المتوسطة او الشديدة','(indications): this medication is an opioid analgesic prescribed for moderate to severe pain in adults.it works by changing the way the body senses pain.

Due to its good tolerability profile and multimodal mechanism of action, tramadol is generally considered a lower-risk opioid option for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. It is considered a Step 2 option on the World Health Organization''s pain ladder and has about 1/10th of the potency of [morphine]. 

Tramadol differs from other traditional opioid medications in that it doesn''t just act as a μ-opioid agonist, but also affects monoamines by modulating the effects of neurotransmitters involved in the modulation of pain such as serotonin and norepinpehrine which activate descending pain inhibitory pathways.[A182279] Tramadol''s effects on serotonin and norepinephrine mimic the effects of other SNRI antidepressants such as [duloxetine] and [venlafaxine].

Tramadol exists as a racemic mixture consisting of two pharmacologically active enantiomers that both contribute to its analgesic property through different mechanisms and are also themselves metabolized into active metabolites: (+)-tramadol and its primary metabolite (+)-O-desmethyl-tramadol (M1) are agonists of the μ opioid receptor while (+)-tramadol inhibits serotonin reuptake and (-)-tramadol inhibits norepinephrine reuptake. These pathways are complementary and synergistic, improving tramadol''s ability to modulate the perception of and response to pain.[A4269,A183842] 

Tramadol has also been shown to affect a number of other pain modulators within the central nervous system as well as non-neuronal inflammatory markers and immune mediators.[A183728,A183734,A183761,A17159,A182300] Due to the broad spectrum of targets involved in pain and inflammation, it''s not surprising that the evidence has shown that tramadol is effective for a number of pain types including neuropathic pain, post-operative pain, lower back pain, as well as pain associated with labour, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and cancer. Due to its SNRI activity, tramadol also has anxiolytic, antidepressant, and anti-shivering effects which are all frequently found as comorbidities with pain.[A182300]

Similar to other opioid medications, tramadol poses a risk for development of tolerance, dependence and abuse. If used in higher doses, or with other opioids, there is a dose-related risk of overdose, respiratory depression, and death.[A183830,F4679] However, unlike other opioid medications, tramadol use also carries a risk of seizure and serotonin syndrome, particularly if used with other serotonergic medications.[A183836,A179926]','["N02AJ16", "N02AJ13", "N02AJ14", "N02AX02"]','[]'),(11151,'Aaa','ششش','12','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',813,'2022-11-30',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(11152,'Revano soft 50 gm cream','ريفانو سوفت كريم 50 جم','55','','Moisturizing and emollient cream','Panthenol+sun flower oil+alo vera extract+avocado oil+shea butter','Revano pharm','Cream','كريم','50 gm','1','','','','',924,'2024-08-02',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(11153,'Tamoxifen 10mg 30 tablets','تاموكسيفين 10مجم 30 قرص','66','25.5','Estrogen antagonist','Tamoxifen','Technopharm','Tablet','أقراص','10mg','3','علاج بعض امراض النساء ولتنشيط التبويض لتأخر الحمل','','6224008302407','',4175,'2025-04-11',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Tamoxifen is a non-steroidal antiestrogen used to treat estrogen receptor positive breast cancers as well as prevent the incidence of breast cancer in high risk populations.[A1025,L7799,L7802] Tamoxifen is used alone or as an adjuvant in these treatments.[L7799,L7802] Tamoxifen may no longer be the preferred treatment for these types of cancers as patients generally have better survival, side effect profiles, and compliance with [anastrozole].[A1026]

ARBs such as valsartan have been shown in a number of large-scale clinical outcomes trials to improve cardiovascular outcomes including reducing risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, the progression of heart failure, and hospitalization.[A174124,A178153,A173869,A185324,A185327,A185333,A185342,A185345] Valsartan also slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy due to its renoprotective effects.[A174157,A174160,A174163] Improvements in chronic kidney disease with valsartan include both clinically and statistically significant decreases in urinary albumin and protein excretion in patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and in nondiabetic patients diagnosed with chronic kidney disease.[A174124,A173869]

Valsartan was initially approved in 1996 in Europe for the treatment of hypertension in adults. Shortly after, in 1997, this drug was approved in the United States.[A174124] Valsartan is generally well-tolerated with a side-effect profile superior to that of other antihypertensive drugs.[A174130,A174133]','["C09DX05", "C10BX10", "C09DA03", "C09CA03", "C09DX02", "C09DX01", "C09DB08", "C09DB01", "C09DX04"]','[]'),(11182,'Tareg 80mg 14 f.c. tab.','تارج 80مجم 14 قرص','148','113','Antihypertensive.angiotensin blocker','Valsartan','Novartis','Tab','أقراص','80mg','2','علاج ارتفاع ضغط الدم','','6223002641123','',6552,'2024-08-04',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Valsartan belongs to the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs, which also includes [telmisartan], [candesartan], [losartan], [olmesartan], and [irbesartan]. ARBs selectively bind to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) and prevent the protein angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects, which include vasoconstriction, stimulation and synthesis of aldosterone and ADH, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, among others. Overall, valsartan''s physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium. 

Valsartan also affects the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays an important role in hemostasis and regulation of kidney, vascular, and cardiac functions. Pharmacological blockade of RAAS via  AT1 receptor blockade inhibits negative regulatory feedback within RAAS, which is a contributing factor to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal disease. In particular, heart failure is associated with chronic activation of RAAS, leading to inappropriate fluid retention, vasoconstriction, and ultimately a further decline in left ventricular function. ARBs have been shown to have a protective effect on the heart by improving cardiac function, reducing afterload, increasing cardiac output and preventing ventricular hypertrophy and remodelling.[A174154] 

By comparison, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) class of medications (which includes drugs such as [ramipril], [lisinopril], and [perindopril]) inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II through inhibition of the ACE enzyme. However, this does not prevent the formation of all angiotensin II within the body.

Without sufficient quantities of circulating thyroid hormones, symptoms of hypothyroidism begin to develop such as fatigue, increased heart rate, depression[A179620], dry skin and hair, muscle cramps, constipation, weight gain, memory impairment, and poor tolerance to cold temperatures.[F4636,A35722]

In response to Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) release by the pituitary gland, a normally functioning thyroid gland will produce and secrete T4, which is then converted through deiodination (by type I or type II 5′-deiodinases)[A179941] into its active metabolite T3. While T4is the major product secreted by the thyroid gland,  T3exerts the majority of the physiological effects of the thyroid hormones; T4and T3have a relative potency of ~1:4 (T4:T3).[F4633] T4and T3act on nearly every cell of the body, but have a particularly strong effect on the cardiac system.[A179935] As a result, many cardiac functions including heart rate, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance are closely linked to thyroid status.[A179938]

Prior to the development of levothyroxine, [DB09100] or desiccated thyroid, used to be the mainstay of treatment for hypothyroidism. However, this is no longer recommended for the majority of patients due to several clinical concerns including limited controlled trials supporting its use. Desiccated thyroid products contain a ratio of T4 to T3 of 4.2:1, which is significantly lower than the 14:1 ratio of secretion by the human thyroid gland. This higher proportion of T3 in desiccated thyroid products can lead to supraphysiologic levels of T3 which may put patients at risk of thyrotoxicosis if thyroid extract therapy is not adjusted according to the serum TSH.[A35722, F4636]','["H03AA01"]','[]'),(11402,'Westrino mouth wash 120 ml','ويسترينو غسول للفم 120 مل','25','','','','International medical guide','Mouth wash','غسول للفم','120 ml','1','','','','',827,'2024-07-20',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(11403,'Iro-oley plus syrup 100 ml','ايرو اولي بلس شراب 100 مل','70','60','Multivitamin','Iron','Marvel','Syrup','شراب','100 ml','1','','','','',741,'2025-08-04',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'A metallic element found in certain minerals, in nearly all soils, and in mineral waters.

It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infections along with other antibiotics including [amoxicillin], [clarithromycin], and [metronidazole], for example.[A177271][F4498] Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [omeprazole], [esomeprazole], [lansoprazole], [dexlansoprazole], and [rabeprazole].

Pantoprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cell. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of pantoprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, pantoprazole''s duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as pantoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]

PPIs such as pantoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]

Pantoprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing as rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as pantoprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion.[A177574]','["A02BD04", "A02BD11", "A02BC02"]','[]'),(11421,'Iishou 36 cpasules','ليشو 36 كبسولة','250','','Weight loss','','Company','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','علاج للسمنة وزيادة الوزن','','6932474320121','',864,'2023-01-18',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(11422,'Ivy tec-ac syrup 100 ml','ايفي تك شراب 100 مل','60','45','Cough product','Ivy extract','Company','Syrup','شراب','100 ml','1','','','','',886,'2025-02-13',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(11428,'Aaa','ششش','6','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',383,'2022-12-13',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(11430,'Timbestatin 10/20 mg 7 f.c. tab','تيمبيستاتين 10/20 مجم 7 قرص','68','','Antihyperlipidemic.cholesterol absorption inhibitors.combined with statin','Ezetimibe+simvastatin','Dbk pharma > royal group','Tab','أقراص','20 mg','1','يعمل على خفض الدهون والكوليسترول بالجسم.','','','',2762,'2022-07-24',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(11431,'Timogel 0.1% ophth. gel 5 ml','تيموجل 0.1% جل للعين 5 مل','13','','Antihypertensive.beta blocker.unselective','Timolol','Orchidia pharmaceutical industries','Gel','جل','0.1%','1','','','','',977,'2022-11-23',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Timolol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonist given in an eye drop solution to reduce intraocular pressure, or pressure in the eyes.[L6724] It is also used in tablet form as a drug to treat hypertension.[L6727] Timolol was first approved by the FDA in 1978.[L6724] This drug is marketed by several manufacturers [L6736] and is an effective agent for the management of conditions such as open-angle glaucoma and hypertension.','["C07AA06", "S01ED51", "C07BA06", "C07DA06", "S01ED01"]','[]'),(11432,'Timogen 10mg/5ml syrup 120ml','تيموجين شراب 120 مل','23','14','Antispasmodic','Tiemonium methylsulphate','Delta pharma','Syrup','شراب','10mg','1','مضاد للتقلصات.','tiemonium methylsulfate - treatment of acute intense or refractory painful syndromes with a spasmodic component. the use of noramidopyrine is only justified when its activity confers a real advantage over other analgesics. indications: smooth muscle spasm','6221163007222','',2867,'2024-09-10',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(11433,'Timolol-elnile 0.5% eye drops 5 ml (n/a)','تيمولول 0.5% قطرة عين 5 مل','8','','Antihypertensive.beta blocker.unselective','Timolol','El nile.','Drops','نقط','0.5%','1','','about timolol nonselective beta adrenergic blocker ophthalmic- antiglaucoma antimigraine. mechanism of action of timolol timolol is a non selective beta blocker. it inhibits the beta receptors (beta-2) present in the eye such as in the ciliary body epithe','6221077062515','',2217,'2022-12-13',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Timolol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonist given in an eye drop solution to reduce intraocular pressure, or pressure in the eyes.[L6724] It is also used in tablet form as a drug to treat hypertension.[L6727] Timolol was first approved by the FDA in 1978.[L6724] This drug is marketed by several manufacturers [L6736] and is an effective agent for the management of conditions such as open-angle glaucoma and hypertension.','["C07AA06", "S01ED51", "C07BA06", "C07DA06", "S01ED01"]','[]');

TCAs are structurally similar to phenothiazines. They contain a tricyclic ring system with an alkyl amine substituent on the central ring. In non-depressed individuals, imipramine does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. In depressed individuals, imipramine exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Tertiary amine TCAs, such as imipramine and amitriptyline, are more potent inhibitors of serotonin reuptake than secondary amine TCAs, such as nortriptyline and desipramine. TCAs also block histamine H1receptors, α1-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively [A6584]. Imipramine has less sedative and anticholinergic effects than the tertiary amine TCAs, amitriptyline and clomipramine. Imipramine may be used to treat depression and nocturnal enuresis in children [FDA Label].

Vitamin D3 and D2 require hydroxylation in order to become biologically active in the human body.

By inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver, statins lower abnormal cholesterol and lipid levels, and ultimately reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid. This conversion is a critical metabolic reaction involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport, including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as "bad cholesterol"), and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing statins is considered standard practice for patients following any cardiovascular event, and for people who are at moderate to high risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The evidence supporting statin use, coupled with minimal side effects and long term benefits, has resulted in wide use of this medication in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Atorvastatin and other statins including [lovastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [simvastatin] are considered first-line treatment options for dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] The increasing use of this class of drugs is largely attributed to the rise in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (such as heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke) in many countries.[A181084] An elevated cholesterol level (elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in particular) is a significant risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Several landmark studies demonstrate that the use of statins is associated with both a reduction in LDL levels and CVD risk.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins were shown to reduce the incidences of all-cause mortality, including fatal and non-fatal CVD, as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Some evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within five years) statin use leads to a 20%-22% relative reduction in the number of major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

Atorvastatin was first synthesized in 1985 by Dr. Bruce Roth and approved by the FDA in 1996.[T568] It is a pentasubstituted pyrrole [A177415] formed by two contrasting moieties with an achiral heterocyclic core unit and a 3,5-dihydroxypentanoyl side chain identical to its parent compound.[T571] Unlike other members of the statin group, atorvastatin is an active compound and therefore does not require activation.[A177436]','["C10BA05", "C10BX11", "C10BX12", "C10BX18", "C10AA05", "C10BX15", "C10BX03", "C10BX08", "C10BX06"]','[]'),(11557,'Radiseas 60 ml spray','راديسيز سبراي 60 مل','70','','Solution','Sea water+vitamin a+aloe vera extract+glycerine+eucalyptus oil+vitamin e+benzalkonium chloride+panthenol+hyaluronic acid+menthol','Radix pharma','Spray','بخاخ','60 ml','1','','','','',1582,'2023-02-06',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(11562,'Total 500mg/5ml syrup 120 ml','توتال 500مجم/5مل شراب 120 مل','120','75','Omega 3','Cod liver oil','Hochster pharmaceutical industries','Syrup','شراب','500mg','1','غني بالفيتامينات مثل أوميجا ثري -- فيتامين أ -- فيتامين د','total is a suspension with natural orange flavor rich in vitamin a vitamin d and omega 3 fatty acids vitamin a : protects children and young adults from vitamin a deficiency night blindness vitamin d : helps normal growth of bone and teeth omega 3 fatty a','6224007751350','',8447,'2025-03-04',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'D03AA',NULL);

It is considered a Step 2 option on the World Health Organization''s pain ladder and has about 1/10th of the potency of [morphine]. 

Tramadol differs from other traditional opioid medications in that it doesn''t just act as a μ-opioid agonist, but also affects monoamines by modulating the effects of neurotransmitters involved in the modulation of pain such as serotonin and norepinpehrine which activate descending pain inhibitory pathways.[A182279] Tramadol''s effects on serotonin and norepinephrine mimic the effects of other SNRI antidepressants such as [duloxetine] and [venlafaxine].

Tramadol exists as a racemic mixture consisting of two pharmacologically active enantiomers that both contribute to its analgesic property through different mechanisms and are also themselves metabolized into active metabolites: (+)-tramadol and its primary metabolite (+)-O-desmethyl-tramadol (M1) are agonists of the μ opioid receptor while (+)-tramadol inhibits serotonin reuptake and (-)-tramadol inhibits norepinephrine reuptake. These pathways are complementary and synergistic, improving tramadol''s ability to modulate the perception of and response to pain.[A4269,A183842] 

Tramadol has also been shown to affect a number of other pain modulators within the central nervous system as well as non-neuronal inflammatory markers and immune mediators.[A183728,A183734,A183761,A17159,A182300] Due to the broad spectrum of targets involved in pain and inflammation, it''s not surprising that the evidence has shown that tramadol is effective for a number of pain types including neuropathic pain, post-operative pain, lower back pain, as well as pain associated with labour, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and cancer. Due to its SNRI activity, tramadol also has anxiolytic, antidepressant, and anti-shivering effects which are all frequently found as comorbidities with pain.[A182300]

Similar to other opioid medications, tramadol poses a risk for development of tolerance, dependence and abuse. If used in higher doses, or with other opioids, there is a dose-related risk of overdose, respiratory depression, and death.[A183830,F4679] However, unlike other opioid medications, tramadol use also carries a risk of seizure and serotonin syndrome, particularly if used with other serotonergic medications.[A183836,A179926]','["N02AJ16", "N02AJ13", "N02AJ14", "N02AX02"]','[]'),(11577,'Nebraglob oral drops 30 ml','نبراجلوب نقط فم 30 مل','75','65','Iron supplement','Iron+vit.(c+b12)+folic acid','Nebras pharmaceutical','Drops','نقط','30 ml','1','','','','',2230,'2025-05-29',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(11578,'Tramal 100mg/ml oral drops. 10 ml','ترامال 100مجم/مل نقط للفم 10 مل','18','','Analgesics.narcotic opioid','Tramadol','Mina pharm > grunenthal-germany','Drops','نقط','100mg','1','','(indications): this medication is an opioid analgesic prescribed for moderate to severe pain in adults.it works by changing the way the body senses pain.

It is considered a Step 2 option on the World Health Organization''s pain ladder and has about 1/10th of the potency of [morphine]. 

Tramadol differs from other traditional opioid medications in that it doesn''t just act as a μ-opioid agonist, but also affects monoamines by modulating the effects of neurotransmitters involved in the modulation of pain such as serotonin and norepinpehrine which activate descending pain inhibitory pathways.[A182279] Tramadol''s effects on serotonin and norepinephrine mimic the effects of other SNRI antidepressants such as [duloxetine] and [venlafaxine].

Tramadol exists as a racemic mixture consisting of two pharmacologically active enantiomers that both contribute to its analgesic property through different mechanisms and are also themselves metabolized into active metabolites: (+)-tramadol and its primary metabolite (+)-O-desmethyl-tramadol (M1) are agonists of the μ opioid receptor while (+)-tramadol inhibits serotonin reuptake and (-)-tramadol inhibits norepinephrine reuptake. These pathways are complementary and synergistic, improving tramadol''s ability to modulate the perception of and response to pain.[A4269,A183842]

It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infections along with other antibiotics including [DB01060], [DB01211], and [DB00916], for example.[A177271, F4498] Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [DB00338], [DB00213], [DB00448], [DB05351], and [DB01129]. Esomeprazole is the s-isomer of [DB00338], which is a racemate of the S- and R-enantiomer. Esomeprazole has been shown to inhibit acid secretion to a similar extent as [DB00338], without any significant differences between the two compounds _in vitro_. 

Esomeprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of esomeprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, esomeprazole''s duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]

PPIs such as esomeprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as esomeprazole has been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients such as iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]

Rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as esomeprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion.[A177574] Esomeprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing to prevent this rebound effect.','["A02BD06", "A02BC05", "M01AE52"]','[]'),(11658,'Aaa','ششش','6','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',741,'2022-12-13',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(11659,'Tricogyn vaginal jel 50 gm','ترايكوجين 50 جرام جيل','90','80','Lubricant','Tea tree oil+chamomile extract+thyme oil+triclosan+carbomer 940+glycerin+alum extract+propylene glyc','Hi-care > novex','Unknown','غير محدد','50 gm','1','مزلق - لتخفيف الاحتكاك','**indications : used as a lubricant in vaginal dryness to relieve the pain and improve the sexual pleasure . rejuvenation of the vaginal mucosa after delivery . post menopausal vaginal atrophy . vagina tightening gel','769503325026','',10640,'2025-01-27',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(11660,'Aaa','ششش','27','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',756,'2022-09-21',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(11664,'Tridil 50mg ( 5mg/ml ) amp 10 ml','تريديل 50مجم امبول 10 مل','46','','Organic nitrates','Glyceryl trinitrate','Infra services private limited','Amp','أمبول','50mg','1','علاج الذبحة الصدرية -- علاج فشل القلب الاحتقاني -- علاج ارتفاع الضغط','','','',4010,'2023-05-05',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,'C01DA02',NULL),(11665,'Aaa','ششش','380','','','','','Unknown','غير محدد','','1','','','','',464,'2022-08-17',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,NULL),(11667,'Trilafon 8mg 100 tab','تريلافون 8مجم 100 قرص','106','','Psychiatric.antipsychotics','Perphenazine','Sigma','Tab','أقراص','8mg','1','علاج الامراض النفسية','','','',939,'2023-01-26',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'An antipsychotic phenothiazine derivative with actions and uses similar to those of chlorpromazine.','["N05AB03"]','[]'),(11669,'Trileptal 300mg 50 f.c.tab.','ترايلبتال 300مجم 50 قرص','356','223','Anti-epileptic.carboxamides','Oxcarbazepine','Novartis','Tab','أقراص','300mg','5','علاج الصرع -- تقليل التشنجات','','','',9880,'2024-12-08',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Oxcarbazepine is an anti-epileptic medication used in the treatment of partial onset seizures that was first approved for use in the United States in 2000.[L8627,L8630,L8633] It is a structural derivative of [carbamazepine][A186101] and exerts a majority of its activity via a pharmacologically active metabolite, MHD, which exists as a racemate in the blood - a pro-drug of the more active (S)-enantiomer is also marketed as a separate anti-epileptic under the name [eslicarbazepine].[A186011] Compared to other anti-epileptic drugs, which are generally metabolized via the cytochrome P450 system, oxcarbazepine has a reduced propensity for involvement in drug-drug interactions owing to its primarily reductive metabolism.[A186032]','["N03AF02"]','[]'),(11670,'Quetiapine 300mg 30 f.c. tabs.','كويتيابين 300مجم 30 قرص','336','','Psychiatric.antipsychotics','Quetiapine','Global napi pharmaceuticals > future pharmaceutical industries (fpi)','Tab','أقراص','300mg','3','','','','',1366,'2024-08-29',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,'Initially approved by the FDA in 1997, quetiapine is a second-generation atypical antipsychotic used in schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar disorder.[L8546] Quetiapine demonstrates a high level of therapeutic efficacy and low risk of adverse effects during long-term treatment.
