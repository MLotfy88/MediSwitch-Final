    "indications": "Mercury has been used for centuries in multiple capacities, including medicinal and widespread industrial use. Because of this, it is a common chemical exposure and environmental pollutant. There are several forms of mercury that lead to different mercury intoxication syndromes.\n[1]",
    "mechanism": "Mercury exists in organic and inorganic forms. The inorganic form could be further subdivided into elemental mercury (also known as \"quicksilver\") and mercury salts. Elemental exposures are typically from mercury-containing devices such as thermometers. Mercury salt exposures can be seen with disc battery ingestion or laxative abuse. Organic mercury can also be subdivided into short-chain and long-chain compounds. Organic mercury exposure usually occurs from ingestion of contaminated seafood, paints containing mercury, or ingestion/injections of thimerasol.\n[2]",
    "monitoring": "In the emergency department, the most critical facet of the evaluation is a thorough history, including possible exposures and identifying the symptoms consistent with any of the mercury toxicity syndromes.  Initial testing would include a chest radiograph, urinalysis,  and basic bloodwork such as a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. A 24-hour urine collection for mercury levels should be obtained as well as whole-blood mercury levels in the case of organic mercury exposure as there is very little urinary excretion of these compounds. Positive levels confirm exposure, but the levels do not directly correlate with toxicity.",
    "administration": "Initial treatment in the emergency department consists of removal from the exposure and decontamination of the patient. After the patient and department are safe from exposure, supportive measures should begin, including oxygen and intravenous (IV) fluids. Monitor and manage any complications of the toxicity, such as respiratory distress, gastrointestinal bleeding, renal failure, and bowel perforation. GI decontamination should be attempted if possible, although there are risks of perforation. Charcoal which is not a highly effective binding metal should still be attempted, in addition to whole bowel irrigation, even if only minimally effective. Chelation should be initiated early in mercury exposure cases as it may decrease the toxic effects. Inorganic mercury and elemental mercury can be treated with an initial course of intramuscular dimercaprol and then followed by oral succimer. The dosing regimen for dimercaprol starts at 5 mg/kg per dose every 4 hours for 48 hours, followed by 2.5 mg/kg per dose every 6 hours for 48 hours, and then 2.5 mg/kg per dose every 12 hours for 7 days. Oral succimer follows this treatment at a dose of 10 mg/kg per dose orally 3 times a day for 5 days, then twice daily for 14 days. Organic exposures should not be treated with dimercaprol as there is evidence it can exacerbate neurologic toxicity.  In these cases, the only succimer should be administered. It is controversial whether peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis is beneficial due to the high degree of protein binding and distribution, although dialysis may be necessary due to renal damage. In addition, exchange transfusions should be attempted, but there is no supporting evidence of improved outcomes.\n[10]"
