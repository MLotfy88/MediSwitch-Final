Serious infections including sepsis, as well as opportunistic infections like Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis, and aspergillosis have been reported with the use of leflunomide, particularly in patients on concomitant hematotoxic therapy. Agents that may be significantly immuno- or myelosuppressive include antineoplastic agents, radiation, zidovudine, linezolid, some antirheumatic agents, high dosages of corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic agents , and long-term topical or inhaled corticosteroids. Rare cases of pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia have also occurred with leflunomide alone, but were most frequent in the presence of concomitant or recent use of methotrexate or other myelotoxic agents. Due to the prolonged elimination half-life of leflunomide''s active metabolite, an interaction may occur even when hematotoxic agents are initiated after the discontinuation of leflunomide. Administering a washout procedure with cholestyramine or activated charcoal helps to accelerate elimination of the active metabolite from plasma and reduce the overlap of systemic exposure to these agents.', 'DDInter', 'Close monitoring for the development of infection is recommended if leflunomide or teriflunomide is used in patients who are currently receiving or have recently received other immuno- or myelosuppressive agents, and vice versa.
