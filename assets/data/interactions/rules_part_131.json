Repeat procedures with contrast media, if necessary, should not occur until at least 72 hours after the previous contrast exposure and renal function has fully recovered. Although it is not necessary to measure the serum creatinine levels of every patient before contrast administration, measurements should generally be made in patients receiving contrast agent by intraarterial administration (which is associated with increased risk of nephropathy relative to intravenous administration) and patients with a history of kidney disease, proteinuria, kidney surgery, diabetes, hypertension, gout, or other risk factors for nephropathy.

Serious infections including sepsis, as well as opportunistic infections like Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis, and aspergillosis have been reported with the use of leflunomide, particularly in patients on concomitant hematotoxic therapy. Agents that may be significantly immuno- or myelosuppressive include antineoplastic agents, radiation, zidovudine, linezolid, some antirheumatic agents, high dosages of corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic agents , and long-term topical or inhaled corticosteroids. Rare cases of pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia have also occurred with leflunomide alone, but were most frequent in the presence of concomitant or recent use of methotrexate or other myelotoxic agents. Due to the prolonged elimination half-life of leflunomide's active metabolite, an interaction may occur even when hematotoxic agents are initiated after the discontinuation of leflunomide.

The risk is thought to extend to teriflunomide, its principal active metabolite, because recommended dosages of both result in a similar range of plasma concentrations of teriflunomide. Serious infections including sepsis, as well as opportunistic infections like Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis, and aspergillosis have been reported with the use of leflunomide, particularly in patients on concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. Rare cases of pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia have also occurred with leflunomide alone, but were most frequent in the presence of concomitant or recent use of methotrexate or other myelotoxic agents. No specific data are available regarding use in combination with fingolimod, an agent that causes reversible sequestration of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues. The concomitant or sequential use (without the recommended leflunomide washout period or procedure) of other agents known to induce hepatotoxicity may potentiate the risk of liver injury associated with leflunomide. The risk is thought to extend to teriflunomide, its principal active metabolite, because recommended dosages of both result in a similar range of plasma concentrations of teriflunomide. Elevated liver transaminases, hepatitis, jaundice/cholestasis, hepatic failure, and acute hepatic necrosis have been reported with leflunomide. Liver enzyme elevations were generally mild (2-fold ULN or less) and resolved while continuing treatment. Marked elevations (greater than 3-fold ULN) occurred infrequently and reversed with dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment. However, fatalities associated with severe liver injury have also been reported rarely.",

Liver enzymes, bilirubin, platelet, white blood cell count, and hemoglobin or hematocrit should be evaluated at baseline and regularly during therapy. If evidence of serious hepatotoxicity (i.e., ALT elevation greater than 3-fold ULN or persistent elevations between 2- and 3-fold ULN despite dose reduction), infection, or bone marrow suppression occurs, treatment should be stopped, and cholestyramine or charcoal administered to accelerate elimination of leflunomide's active metabolite from plasma, which otherwise may take up to two years. Similarly, recent complete blood count and transaminase and bilirubin levels (i.e., within last 6 months) should be available before initiating treatment with fingolimod. If a serious infection or significant liver injury develops, treatment should be suspended and the benefits and risks reassessed prior to restarting treatment. Because fingolimod remains in the blood for up to two months after the last dose, continued monitoring is recommended throughout this period. Patients should be advised to seek medical attention if they develop an infection or experience potential signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as fever, rash, itching, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, malaise, right upper quadrant pain, dark urine, light colored stools, and jaundice.",
