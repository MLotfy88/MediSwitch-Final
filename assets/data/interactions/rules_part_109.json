The risk of hypocalcemia may also be increased, as drug-induced renal tubular damage can lead to renal loss of calcium and other electrolytes such as magnesium. Bisphosphonates alone often cause mild, asymptomatic hypocalcemia via inhibitive effects on bone resorption and possibly chelation of blood calcium.

The risk is thought to extend to teriflunomide, its principal active metabolite, because recommended dosages of both result in a similar range of plasma concentrations of teriflunomide. Serious infections including sepsis, as well as opportunistic infections like Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis, and aspergillosis have been reported with the use of leflunomide, particularly in patients on concomitant hematotoxic therapy. Agents that may be significantly immuno- or myelosuppressive include antineoplastic agents, radiation, zidovudine, linezolid, some antirheumatic agents, high dosages of corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic agents , and long-term topical or inhaled corticosteroids. Rare cases of pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia have also occurred with leflunomide alone, but were most frequent in the presence of concomitant or recent use of methotrexate or other myelotoxic agents. Due to the prolonged elimination half-life of leflunomide's active metabolite, an interaction may occur even when hematotoxic agents are initiated after the discontinuation of leflunomide. Administering a washout procedure with cholestyramine or activated charcoal helps to accelerate elimination of the active metabolite from plasma and reduce the overlap of systemic exposure to these agents.",

Patients should be advised to contact their physician if they develop signs and symptoms of infection such as fever, chills, diarrhea, sore throat, muscle aches, shortness of breath, blood in phlegm, weight loss, red or inflamed skin, body sores, and pain or burning during urination. If evidence of serious infection or bone marrow suppression occurs, treatment should be stopped, and cholestyramine or charcoal administered to accelerate elimination of leflunomide's active metabolite from plasma, which otherwise may take up to two years.",

      "management_text": "Concomitant use of azathioprine with other immunosuppressive or myelosuppressive agents should be avoided whenever possible. Close clinical and laboratory monitoring for hematologic toxicity is advised if coadministration is required. Since azathioprine is considered a slow-acting drug, delayed myelosuppression may occur, and effects may persist even after the drug has been discontinued. Prompt reduction in dosage or temporary withdrawal of azathioprine may be necessary if a persistently low or rapid decline in leucocyte count occurs, or if there is other evidence of bone marrow depression.",
