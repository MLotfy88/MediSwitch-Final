This can affect divers at any depth, including commonly-seen recreational diving depths of 20m/60ft or less.\nIncreased inhaled partial pressures of oxygen, generally beyond 1.4-1.6atm, increases risk of oxygen toxicity. This is typically not a substantial risk in common depths of recreational divers at 20m/60ft of depth or less, but can be for more advanced divers at deeper depths.",
