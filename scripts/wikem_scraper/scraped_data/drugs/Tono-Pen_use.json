      "text": "The Pen should be calibrated if the batteries have been changed or if the LCD reads “CAL” followed by “- - - -”.\nCalibration involves depressing the Operator Button TWICE and getting ONE line (- - - -).\nIf so,\nPoint the transducer end straight down towards the floor.\nPress the Operator Button “distinctly, two times, within 1.5 seconds.”\nInitially “CAL” appears on the LCD, followed by “UP” (after about 15 - 30 seconds!)\nInvert the transducer end to point straight up toward the sky.\nA properly functioning Pen will display “”Good”.\nIf “bAd”, repeat the calibration again.",
