    "indications": "Known allergies or hypersensitivities to the drug or excipients are a contraindication to using oseltamivir. Cases of anaphylaxis have been reported.\n[28]\n\nWarning and Precautions\n\nCommercially available oral suspension of oseltamivir contains sorbitol and saccharin sodium and should be used cautiously in patients with hereditary fructose intolerance.\n[29]\nSince the suspension contains sodium benzoate, watch for gasping syndrome in neonates.\n[30]\nOseltamivir should not be used in patients with influenza illnesses due to strains confirmed as resistant to oseltamivir. In addition, it should not be used for diseases caused by organisms other than influenza viruses.\n[7]",
    "mechanism": "Oseltamivir is an antiviral neuraminidase inhibitor with potent and selective competitive inhibition of the influenza virus neuraminidase, an enzyme necessary for viral replication. Oseltamivir phosphate is an inactive prodrug that exerts pharmacologic activity when hydrolyzed in vivo to the active form, oseltamivir carboxylate. This activated form interferes with the release of progeny influenza virus from infected host cells and halts the spread of infection to new host cells. Oseltamivir reduces the duration of shedding and the viral titer and can shorten the length of symptoms by 0.5 to 3 days.\n[6]\n\nMechanism of Resistance:\nThe mechanism of resistance of influenza viruses involves antigenic drift and shift in their surface glycoproteins. Antigenic drift is the process in which minor modifications occur in key viral epitopes through point mutations; antigenic shift results in a complete exchange of hemagglutinin (HA) or neuraminidase (NA) genes. Antigenic shift emerges mainly in influenza A viruses due to their vast animal reservoirs. Antigenic shift is a process frequently associated with the outbreak of pandemics.\n[7]\n\nPharmacokinetics\n\nAbsorption:\nOseltamivir is an orally administrated prodrug. The oral bioavailability of oseltamivir is approximately 80%. Oral intake does not seem to impact the pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir significantly.\n\nDistribution:\nThe volume of distribution is approximately 23 to 26 liters. Oseltamivir is moderately bound to plasma proteins (42%), while oseltamivir carboxylate has poor plasma protein binding.\n\nMetabolism:\nHepatic carboxylesterases extensively hydrolyze oseltamivir to the active drug oseltamivir carboxylate (OC). The active metabolite, oseltamivir, is a major circulating component (95%) in plasma, and the prodrug oseltamivir accounts for only 5% of the circulating component.\n\nElimination:\nOsaletmevir carboxylate is eliminated (>99%) through renal excretion by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion. The half-life of oseltamivir carboxylate is 6 to 10 hours, while the half-life of oseltamivir is approximately 3 hours.\n[8]",
    "administration": "Available Dosage Forms\n\nOseltamivir phosphate is administered orally, with or without meals, and is available in capsule form of 3 different dosages (30, 45, and 75 mg) and an oral powder for reconstitution to suspension for pediatric patients. Therapy should be initiated as early as possible, and maximum benefit is derived when started within 48 hours of the onset of illness. However, treatment must be initiated before the 48-hour window for severe illness or patients at risk of complications.\n\nAdult Dosing\n\nSeasonal Influenza A and B Treatment (5-day oral course)\n[5]\n\nAdults: 75 mg BID\nInfants 0 to 8 months: 3 mg/kg/dose BID\nInfants 9 to 11 months: 3.5 mg/kg/dose BID\nChildren 1 to 12 yrs old:\n<15 kg: 30 mg BID\n15 kg to 23 kg: 45 mg BID\n23 kg to 40 kg: 60 mg BID\n>40 kg: 75 mg PO BID\n\nPatients with severe infections admitted to an intensive care unit, or immunosuppressed may require oseltamivir treatment for a prolonged indeterminate duration (more than 5 days).\n\nTreatment Dosing Adjustments for Creatinine Clearance\n\nCrCl 30 to 60 mL/min: 30 mg BID\nCrCl less than 30 mL/min: 30 mg daily\nPatients on hemodialysis: 30 mg after dialysis x 5 days (assumes 3 HD sessions)\n\nSeasonal Influenza A and B Prophylaxis (7 to 10-day oral course)\n\nAdults: 75 mg daily\n[9]\nInfants 0 to 8 months: 3 mg/kg/dose daily (not indicated for under 3 months unless clinically critical)\nInfants 9 to 11 months: 3 mg/kg/dose daily\nChildren 1 to 12 yrs old:\n<15 kg: 30 mg daily\n15 kg to 23 kg: 45 mg daily\n23 kg to 40 kg: 60 mg daily\n>40 kg: 75 mg daily\n\nProphylaxis Dosing Adjustments for Creatinine Clearance\n\nCrCl 30 to 60 mL/min: 30 mg daily\nCrCl less than 30 mL/min: 30 mg every other day\nEnd-stage renal disease: use is not recommended\n\nWhile recommendations for oseltamivir include the treatment of avian influenza infections, the optimum dosage and duration of therapy are unknown for these infections.\n[10]\n\nSpecific Patient Populations\n\nHepatic impairment:\nAccording to the manufacturer's labeling information, no dosage adjustment is recommended in case of mild to moderate liver disease. In severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C), oseltamivir exposure (AUC) is elevated by a factor of 6. Use in severe hepatic impairment is not recommended.\n[11]\n\nRenal impairment:\nThe first dose should be 75 mg for patients with normal body mass. Subsequent doses should be decreased according to the degree of renal impairment. In patients on hemodialysis, reduce the oseltamivir dosage by 30 mg and an additional 30 mg after each hemodialysis session, ensuring the treatment duration does not exceed 5 days.\n[12]\n\nPregnancy considerations:\nComplications of influenza during pregnancy include late pregnancy loss and a decrease in mean birth weight.\n[13]\nSince pregnant and postpartum women are at increased risk of severe seasonal and pandemic influenza infection complications, the CDC recommends treatment and prevention with oseltamivir or zanamivir according to viral strain. Complications of influenza during pregnancy include late pregnancy loss and a decrease in mean birth weight.\n[14]\n\nBreastfeeding considerations:\nLimited clinical information suggests that oseltamivir and its active metabolites are excreted into breast milk in trace amounts. Oseltamivir is a former FDA pregnancy class C. A maternal dose of 150 mg of oseltamivir daily produces low levels in milk and is not anticipated to cause adverse drug reactions in breastfed infants.\n[15]\n\nPediatric patients:\nFor pediatric patients, administer oral suspension (6 mg/mL) based on weight. Ensure accurate dosing for infants. Use oral suspension if swallowing capsules is difficult. Postexposure prophylaxis lasts 10 days, while seasonal prevention is up to 6 weeks (or 12 weeks in immunocompromised cases). A recent study indicates that administering oseltamivir early in hospitalized children led to reduced hospitalization duration and the likelihood of 7-day readmission, ECMO use, and mortality. These results affirm the current guidelines advocating oseltamivir utilization in hospitalized children with influenza.\n[16]\n\nOlder patients:\nNo dose adjustments are needed for older adults in treatment and prevention with oseltamivir, considering drug exposure and tolerability.",
    "adverse_effects": "Oseltamivir is generally well-tolerated.\n[17]\nThe most common side effects include nausea (up to 10%), vomiting (2% to 15%), abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, insomnia, and vertigo. Vomiting is the most frequently reported side effect in children (16% of children aged 1 to 12).\n[18]\n\nOther adverse effects occurring less than 1% of the time include conjunctivitis, epistaxis, allergy, arrhythmia, GI bleeding, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, confusion, seizures, and neuropsychiatric events.\n[6]\n[19]\n[20]\n\nCutaneous adverse drug reactions like erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis have also been reported.\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n\nSerum aminotransferase elevations have been reported in 2% of clinical trials, but enzyme elevation in patients was transient and asymptomatic. The mechanism of hepatotoxicity is thought to be immunoallergic. Rare cases of liver injury and jaundice have been reported, but influenza infection can also lead to serum enzyme elevations and jaundice. Consequently, the likelihood score is D (possible rare cause of clinically apparent liver injury).\n[24]\n\nDrug-Drug Interactions\n\nInfluenza antiviral medications may decrease the efficacy of LAIV4 (live attenuated influenza vaccine) if administered within 48 hours to 14 days after LAIV4.\n[25]\nOseltamivir is an ester prodrug, and oseltamivir carboxylate contributes to the antiviral activity. Hydrolytic activation is mediated by human carboxylesterase (HCE) 1. In the presence of clopidogrel, the hydrolysis of oseltamivir is inhibited, leading to reduced antiviral efficacy.\n[26]\n[27]",
    "monitoring": "Repeat RT-PCR or viral culture can determine the viral load in critically ill patients. Neuropsychiatric events, including self-injury, confusion, and delirium, should be monitored, especially in children; reports of these events in children primarily occur in Japan and have also had correlations with fatalities.\n[31]\nThe influenza risk assessment tool is a systematic approach for evaluating and monitoring threats by influenza viruses.\n[32]",
    "toxicity": "Oseltamivir is generally very well tolerated and has few drug interactions. Multiple animal toxicity studies, pre-marketing, and post-marketing of oseltamivir have indicated respiratory suppression resulting from central nervous system suppression, hypothermia, hypoactivity, and sudden death. This adverse event correlates with sudden-onset-type neuropsychiatric reactions in human patients (especially children from Japan), but no definitive link has been established.\n[33]\nThe oseltamivir-induced liver injury requires discontinuation of the drug and avoidance of reexposure. Most patients recover after discontinuation of oseltamivir without specific interventions.\n[24]"
