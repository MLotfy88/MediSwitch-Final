Eighth cranial nerve damage may manifest as tinnitus and varying degrees of hearing impairment.  Nephrotoxicity is usually evidenced by transient elevations in BUN or serum creatinine concentrations, as well as the presence of hyaline and granular casts and albumin in the urine.  Rarely, acute interstitial nephritis has been reported.  Although vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity is generally reversible following discontinuation of the drug, death from uremia has occurred.  Therapy with vancomycin should be administered cautiously at reduced dosages in patients with renal impairment, since they may be at increased risk for oto- and nephrotoxicity due to drug accumulation.  To minimize the risk of toxicity, the usual dosage should not be exceeded, use with other neuro- and nephrotoxic agents should be avoided, and serum drug concentrations should be periodically determined and dosage adjusted to maintain desired levels.  Oto- and nephrotoxicity has generally been associated with serum vancomycin levels of 80 to 100 mcg/mL, although toxic reactions have also been reported at levels as low as 25 mcg/mL.  Renal and eighth cranial nerve function should be closely monitored, and the dosage reduced or therapy withdrawn if toxicity develops.Oral vancomycin is generally not associated with systemic toxicity due to poor absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.  However, clinically significant serum concentrations have been reported in some patients following multiple oral doses of vancomycin for active Clostridium difficile pseudomembranous colitis.  The risk for systemic adverse effects may be greatest in patients with preexisting renal impairment.  Therefore, when vancomycin is administered orally, clinicians may want to heed the usual warnings and precautions associated with intravenous use of the drug.', '3', '', 'DDInter', 0);
