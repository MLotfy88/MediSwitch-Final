Patients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience potential signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as fever, rash, itching, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, right upper quadrant pain, dark urine, pale stools, and jaundice.', 'Synergism', NULL, NULL, 'Moderate', NULL, 'DDInter', 'pharmacodynamic', 1767317476);
