    "clinical_significance": "The clinical significance of the polyol pathway is tied to diabetes in terms of complications and specific treatment modalities. The complications in a diabetic patient that can arise from the polyol pathway include lens swelling, osmotic imbalance, and peripheral neuropathy.\n[24]\nResearch has also shown that the polyol flux is a key component in developing cataracts, especially in diabetic patients.\n[31]\nThe mechanism is likely due to the overproduction of free radicals and decreased ability to handle those radicals due to the suppressed glutathione reductase activity and the likely accumulation of sugar within the aqueous humor. The polyol pathway also sheds light on potential treatment options for diabetic patients. Aldolase reductase inhibitors have been extensively researched to examine whether they can be effective treatments. The mechanism behind this treatment is that the accumulation of sorbitol is limited by inhibiting the first enzyme of the polyol pathway, aldolase reductase. Aldolase reductase inhibitors include flavonoids, spirohydantoins, and carboxylic acid derivatives.\n[32]\nAdverse effects of these drugs include hypersensitivity reactions. Studies have shown that aldolase reductase inhibitors have been effective in the early stages of diabetic complications.\n[33]\nAldolase reductase inhibitors have shown significant results in delaying cataract formation in animals, but minimal research has occurred testing this on humans. Another study has concluded that aldolase reductase inhibitors may provide significant relief to diabetic patients with certain complications.\n[34]\nDue to the redox imbalance caused by the polyol pathway, GLP-1 agonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors are efficacious in reducing renal oxidative stress and their effects on glycemic control.\n[35]\nThe lack of consensus warrants further research into the indications and effectiveness of aldolase reductase inhibitors as a potential breakthrough in diabetic treatment."
