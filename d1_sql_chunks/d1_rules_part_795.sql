Signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia may occur immediately or hours after drug exposure.  Patients or their caregivers should be advised to seek medical attention if they notice signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia (e.g., cyanotic skin discoloration, abnormal blood coloration, nausea, headache, dizziness, lightheadedness, lethargy, fatigue, dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia, palpitation, anxiety, and confusion).  In severe cases, patients may progress to central nervous system depression, stupor, seizures, acidosis, cardiac arrhythmias, syncope, shock, coma, and death.  Methemoglobinemia should be considered if central cyanosis is unresponsive to oxygen.  Calculated oxygen saturation and pulse oximetry are generally not accurate in the setting of methemoglobinemia.  The diagnosis can be confirmed by an elevated methemoglobin level of at least 10% using co-oximetry.  Methemoglobin concentrations greater than 10% of total hemoglobin will typically cause cyanosis, and levels over 70% are frequently fatal.  However, symptom severity is not always related to methemoglobin levels.  Mild cases often respond to withdrawal of offending agents and symptomatic support.  If a patient does not respond to administration of oxygen, clinically significant or symptomatic methemoglobinemia can be treated with methylene blue 1 to 2 mg/kg by slow intravenous injection over 5 to 10 minutes, which may be repeated within 30 to 60 minutes if necessary.
