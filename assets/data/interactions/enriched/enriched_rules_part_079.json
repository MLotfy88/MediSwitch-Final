Haloperidol treatment alone has been associated with a number of reported cases of torsade de pointes and sudden death. The majority of cases involved intravenous administration or use of higher than recommended dosages. Lithium has also been reported to prolong the QT interval in some patients. In general, the risk of an individual agent or a combination of agents causing ventricular arrhythmia in association with QT prolongation is largely unpredictable but may be increased by certain underlying risk factors such as congenital long QT syndrome, cardiac disease, and electrolyte disturbances (e.g., hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia). In addition, the extent of drug-induced QT prolongation is dependent on the particular drugs involved and dosages of the drugs. Although haloperidol and lithium have been used safely together in many patients, there have been a few reported cases of encephalopathic syndrome consisting of severe neurotoxic effects and extrapyramidal symptoms, followed by irreversible brain damage, associated with the combination.

Serotonin syndrome is a rare but serious and potentially fatal condition thought to result from hyperstimulation of brainstem 5-HT1A and 2A receptors. Symptoms of the serotonin syndrome may include mental status changes such as irritability, altered consciousness, confusion, hallucinations, and coma; autonomic dysfunction such as tachycardia, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, shivering, blood pressure lability, and mydriasis; neuromuscular abnormalities such as hyperreflexia, myoclonus, tremor, rigidity, and ataxia; and gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Since many serotonergic agents can also cause central nervous system depression, concomitant use with opioids may result in increased sedation and impairment of judgment, thinking, and psychomotor skills.",
      "management_text": "Caution is advised when opioids are used concomitantly with serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), other antidepressants/psychotropic agents (e.g., amoxapine, buspirone, lithium, maprotiline, mirtazepine, nefazodone, trazodone, vilazodone), 5-HT1 receptor agonists (triptans), 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, cyclobenzaprine, dextromethorphan, 5-hydroxytryptophan, and St. John's wort. Patients should be monitored for symptoms of the serotonin syndrome during treatment. If serotonin syndrome develops or is suspected during the course of therapy, all serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately and supportive care rendered as necessary.",

      "effect": "Concomitant use of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as acetazolamide, topiramate, and zonisamide with each other or with other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may increase the risk and severity of metabolic acidosis as well as the risk of kidney stone formation due to possible additive pharmacologic effects. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can decrease serum bicarbonate in a dose-related manner and induce non-anion gap, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. In addition, they can promote stone formation by reducing urinary citrate excretion and increasing urinary pH. Because they alter electrolyte and fluid balance, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may also predispose patients to heat-related disorders. Oligohidrosis and hyperthermia have specifically been reported with the use of topiramate or zonisamide, particularly in pediatric patients, and coadministration with other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may potentiate the risk according to the manufacturers. Oligohidrosis and hyperthermia are sometimes associated with serious sequelae, but may be preventable by prompt recognition of symptoms and appropriate treatment.",
      "management_text": "The use of more than one carbonic anhydrase inhibitor at a time is generally not recommended. Patients receiving treatment with a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor should have baseline and periodic measurements of serum bicarbonate. If metabolic acidosis develops and persists, consideration should be given to reducing the dosage or discontinuing treatment. Manifestations of acute or chronic metabolic acidosis may include hyperventilation, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and anorexia, or more severe sequelae like cardiac arrhythmias or stupor. If left untreated, metabolic acidosis can also lead to nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis, osteomalacia (or rickets in children), osteoporosis, and reduced growth rates in pediatric patients. Increased fluid intake is recommended during therapy with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors to increase urinary output, which lowers the concentration of substances involved in stone formation. Patients, particularly pediatric patients, should be monitored closely for evidence of decreased sweating and increased body temperature, especially in warm or hot weather. Proper hydration before and during vigorous activities or exposure to warm temperatures is recommended. Patients (or their guardians or caregivers) should contact their doctor immediately if they develop signs or symptoms of kidney stones such as sudden back pain, abdominal pain and/or blood in the urine, of if they are not sweating as usual, with or without a fever. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors should be used cautiously in the presence of predisposing factors to acidosis, such as renal impairment, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, prolonged or severe diarrhea, a ketogenic diet (i.e., high protein/low carbohydrate), or surgery.",

Theoretically, adverse effects such as drowsiness, paresthesia, tinnitus, electrolyte imbalance, metabolic acidosis, and gastrointestinal disturbances may be increased. Carbonic anhydrase inhibition can also promote kidney stone formation by reducing urinary citrate excretion and increasing urinary pH, and cause oligohidrosis or hyperthermia by altering electrolyte and fluid balance.
