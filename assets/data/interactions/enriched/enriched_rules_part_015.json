Clinical hypoglycemia has been reported during use of some of these agents alone or with insulin and/or insulin secretagogues.",

For the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, tadalafil should be started at 20 mg once daily in patients who have been receiving cobicistat for at least one week. The dosage may be increased to 40 mg once daily based upon individual tolerability. The use of tadalafil for PAH should be avoided during the initiation of cobicistat-containing antiretroviral therapy. The manufacturers recommend that tadalafil be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to initiating the cobicistat regimen. After at least one week, tadalafil may be resumed at 20 mg once daily, and the dosage increased to 40 mg once daily based upon individual tolerability. All patients treated with tadalafil should be advised to promptly notify their physician if they experience pain or tightness in the chest or jaw, irregular heartbeat, nausea, shortness of breath, visual disturbances, syncope, or prolonged erection (greater than 4 hours).",

Caution is advised when inotersen is prescribed with high dosages and/or chronic use of NSAIDs. Serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR), and a urinalysis should be obtained prior to initiation of inotersen and regularly during and for at least 8 weeks after treatment in accordance with the product labeling.

In addition, ddI phosphorylation to the active metabolite may be enhanced by the accumulation of IMP, which is an efficient phosphate donor. Pharmacodynamically, the risk of mitochondrial toxicities such as lipodystrophy, peripheral neuropathy, pancreatitis, and lactic acidosis associated with ddI and other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors may also be increased during coadministration with ribavirin.
