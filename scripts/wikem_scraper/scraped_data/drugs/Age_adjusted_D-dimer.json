      "text": "The\nPE\nderivation and validation study for usage of the\nage adjusted d-dimer\nformula concluded that when combining the d-dimer adjustment with clinical probability, less patients required CTA for exclusion and offered no clinical increase in the rate of missed\nPulmonary embolism\n[1]\n[2]\nSimilarly, using the age adjusted d-dimer in combination with clinical probability can reduce the need for further testing in DVT evaluations with no substantial risk to patient safety\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]",
