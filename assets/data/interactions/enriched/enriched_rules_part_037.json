Close clinical and laboratory monitoring for bleeding complications is recommended if concurrent therapy is required. Drotrecogin alfa should be discontinued immediately if clinically significant bleeding occurs. Continued use of other agents that may have contributed to the bleeding should be carefully assessed. Once adequate hemostasis is attained, drotrecogin alfa may be resumed if necessary.",
