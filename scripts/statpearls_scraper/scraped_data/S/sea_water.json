    "indications": "The physical and mental contraindications for working in compressed air environments align closely with commercial diving. To ensure safe compressed air work practices, a comprehensive evaluation of medical history, medication use, and psychological readiness must be conducted. Any medications or other treatment regimens the worker may be on must also be elucidated. Understanding medications, underlying medical conditions, and their interaction with the hyperbaric environment is crucial. Any significant symptoms or adverse effects from medications under normal conditions may warrant rejection.\n\nMedical evaluations for compressed air workers should be conducted by undersea and hyperbaric medicine physicians, preferably certified by organizations such as the Association of Diving Contractors International (ADCI) and the Dive Medical Advisory Committee (DMAC), having completed a course called Medical Examiner of Divers. These experts follow established protocols and guidelines to ensure the safety and health of compressed air workers, with comprehensive lists of contraindications available on their respective websites.\n\nCompressed air work conditions can vary widely, posing challenges such as environmental changes, technical malfunctions, or emergencies. Before commencing work, each compressed air worker must assess their physical readiness, mental preparedness, and skill level. In addition to obtaining medical clearance, each individual should address the following critical questions undertaking any task:\n\nIs my physical condition sufficient to cope with the required strain?\nAm I mentally prepared to effectively manage the demanding situation?\nDo I possess the necessary skills and proficiency required for this specific activity?\n\nThus, each compressed air worker requires a tailored assessment consisting of more than medical conditions and medications to discover any possible contraindications that they may have to compressed air work.\n[8]",
    "clinical_significance": "Continuous medical oversight is essential for compressed air workers to ensure their fitness for duty; monitor chronic conditions such as dysbaric osteonecrosis, barotrauma, and silicosis; and mitigate environmental and gas-related effects, including risks associated with nitrogen narcosis, oxygen toxicity, and high-pressure nervous syndrome. Regular medical evaluations and surveillance play a crucial role in maintaining the health and safety of these workers in their challenging operating environments. However, the health care provided to compressed air workers lacks consistency and standardization, with occupational medicine physicians, undersea and hyperbaric medicine physicians, and primary care practitioners typically conducting health evaluations.\n\nCurrent OSHA guidelines require physicians caring for compressed air workers to have experience with individuals exposed to extreme atmospheric pressure. This requirement highlights the need for significant revision to ensure proper training, qualifications, and experience comparable to any other medical specialty.\n[10]\nUndersea and hyperbaric medicine physicians undergo rigorous 1-year fellowship training to attain board certification, enabling them to provide comprehensive care for compressed air workers at the expected standard of any medical specialty. Although some occupational medicine physicians and primary care providers may have relevant experience, particularly in regions with commercial diving activities, maintaining accurate health records is crucial, considering compressed air workers often relocate.\n\nAccess to these records ensures responsible and consistent care during periodic health evaluations and follow-ups, especially for organ systems impacting their careers. The days of only monitoring health issues such as myopia, decompression sickness, and silica exposure in caisson workers have passed.\n[17]\n[33]\n[34]\n[35]\nHowever, despite the pressing need for new clinical trials to assess risks to compressed air workers, ongoing studies are scarce, relying mainly on limited communications and self-reporting from divers.\n[36]\nSubstantial policy changes are warranted to address immediate health concerns and long-term healthcare needs for compressed air workers."
