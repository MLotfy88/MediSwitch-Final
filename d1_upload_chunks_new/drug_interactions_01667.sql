Nonselective and high doses of cardioselective beta-blockers may cause severe or fatal bronchospasm by opposing theophylline-induced bronchodilation. Ophthalmic beta-blockers undergo significant systemic absorption and may also interact. In addition, propranolol and other beta-blockers may reduce the CYP450 hepatic metabolism of theophylline, and serum theophylline levels may be increased.', 'DDInter', 'Oral and ophthalmic nonselective beta-blockers (e.g., carteolol, carvedilol, levobunolol, metipranolol, nadolol, oxprenolol, penbutolol, pindolol, propranolol, sotalol, and timolol) are considered contraindicated in patients with bronchospastic diseases. Cardioselective beta-blockers should generally be avoided, or used with extreme caution if no other alternatives are available and the benefits outweigh the risks of potentially severe bronchospasm. If patients do receive this combination, they should be closely monitored for increased serum theophylline levels but decreased bronchodilatory effectiveness.', 'Antagonism', 'Oral and ophthalmic nonselective beta-blockers (e.', 'Major', 'pharmacodynamic', NULL, 'https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/166969/', '', 'Amlodipine, Ivabradine', 'Omalizumab, Tezepelumab, Mercaptopurine, Benralizumab, Caffeine, Reslizumab, Mepolizumab, Roflumilast, Zafirlukast, Bromotheophylline', 1767369485);
