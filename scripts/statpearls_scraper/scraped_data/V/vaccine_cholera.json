    "indications": "Patients with T-cell deficiencies (including SCID) should not be vaccinated with the live-attenuated vaccine because there is a danger that the antigen will reverse its pathogenicity and cause illness. Patients with IgA deficiency should not receive IgG preparations that are not highly purified because there is a danger of a hypersensitivity reaction. If the immune system does not recognize the IgA in the preparation, this can be life-threatening. Patients with DiGeorge syndrome should not be transplanted with a thymus older than 14 weeks because a graft-versus-host reaction may occur. The donor can be a sibling or a parent if genetic compatibility exists. Blood group compatibility for major antigens (such as the ABO system and Rh system) must match.\n[14]\n[16]",
    "mechanism": "Intravenous Immunoglobulins (IVIG)\n\nIVIG is a product isolated from fractionation pools of thousands of plasma donations collected in blood transfusion services. Traces of IgM, IgA, and cytokines are present in IVIG. IVIGs have several proposed mechanisms of action including:\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n\nEffects of IVIG on activated B-lymphocytes\nInfusion of IVIG results in auto-IgG suppression\nInteraction of Fc fragment with Fc receptors\nInteraction of infused IgG with complement proteins\nModulation of synthesis of cytokines\nModulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis\nRemyelination\nNeutralizes pathogenic autoantibodies\nInterferes with antigen presentation\nFunctional blockade of Fc receptors on splenic macrophages\nSelection of immune repertoires\nNeutralization of bacterial toxins and superantigens\nHindrance of natural killer cell activity\nInhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-9\nSuppression of NF-kB activation and IkB degradation\nG1 cell cycle arrest\nPrevention of tumor growth\nEnhances the expansion of Tregs\n\nIVIG has been used with some success to improve the symptoms and clinical signs of conditions that include:\n\nImmune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)\nGuillain-Barre syndrome\nChronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)\nIdiopathic inflammatory myopathies\nANCA-associated vasculitis\nMultiple motor neuropathy\nMultiple sclerosis\nMyasthenia gravis\nKawasaki disease\nAutoimmune uveitis\nDermatomyositis\nSystemic sclerosis\nSjögren syndrome\nAntiphospholipid antibody syndrome\nStill disease\nAcute disseminated encephalomyelitis\nDiabetic neuropathy\nLambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome\nOpsoclonus-myoclonus\nPediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections\nPolymyositis\nRasmussen encephalitis\nStiff person syndrome\nPrimary immunodeficiency disorders\nSecondary immunodeficiency disorder\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia\nBone marrow transplantation\nTreatment-induced neutropenia and thrombocytopenia\nAIDS\nAutoimmune thyroiditis\nInclusion-body myositis\nGraft-versus-host disease\nRecurrent pregnancy loss\nCancer\nSevere infections\nToxic epidermal necrolysis\nStevens-Johnson syndrome\nNeonatal hemochromatosis\n\nTransfer Factor\n\nTransfer factor is a dialysable extract of leukocytes that can transfer cell-mediated immunity from one individual to another. It may be used for several pathologies, including immunodeficiencies, viral infections, malignancies, and recurrent fungal infections. Some patients with type I hypersensitivity disorders have demonstrated a response to this product.\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n\nImmunosuppressors\n\nSteroids inhibit cytokine synthesis, affect cell migration, and inhibit the production of leukocytes. Together with chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide acts by covalent alkylation to exert an immunomodulatory effect. This combination inhibits the separation of DNA strands during replication. Methotrexate is an analog of folic acid and blocks pathways essential for DNA synthesis. Azathioprine is a drug that can convert to 6-mercaptopurine to be incorporated into DNA as a fraudulent base.\n[13]\n\nTransplantation\n\nTransplantation is a promising solution for many rare diseases that can manifest as primary immunodeficiencies, including severe-combined immunodeficiency disorder (SCID), DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and X-linked agammaglobulinemia.\n[14]\n\nSeveral Immunotherapy Modalities Used in Cancer Treatment\n\nThe use of monoclonal antibodies can be used in cancer immunotherapy (eg, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). These drugs include pembrolizumab and atezolizumab. These ICIs unlock the immune system, which is then able to recognize tumors and kill them.\n[4]\n\nCytokines have successfully treated certain malignancies. For example, IL-2 combined with interferon-γ for renal carcinoma, interferon-α and β for hairy leukemia, and TNF-α used in various tumors caused a notable reduction of the mass. These cytokines upregulated the immune system by stimulating T-cell and NK cell activation and increased MHC class I expression.\n\nCAR T-cell therapy, or Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell therapy, is a groundbreaking immunotherapy approach used to treat certain types of cancer. Here are the key principles:\n[15]\n[6]\n\nCAR Structure: CARs are synthetic receptors that redirect T-cells to recognize and attack cancer cells. They consist of an extracellular antigen-binding domain, a transmembrane domain, and intracellular signaling domains.\nAntigen Recognition: The extracellular domain of the CAR is engineered to recognize a specific antigen present on the surface of cancer cells. This antigen is often a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) or a cancer-specific antigen.\nT-Cell Activation: Upon binding to the target antigen, the CAR activates the T-cell, leading to its proliferation, cytokine release, and cytotoxic activity against the cancer cell.\nPersistence and Memory: CAR T-cells are designed to persist in the body and form memory cells, providing long-term surveillance against cancer recurrence.\nTreatment Process: The CAR T-cell therapy process involves collecting a patient's T-cells through leukapheresis, genetically engineering them to express the CAR, expanding them in the laboratory, and then reinfusing them into the patient.\nClinical Applications: CAR T-cell therapy has shown remarkable success in treating certain hematological malignancies, such as B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and certain types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). It is also being investigated for solid tumors.\nChallenges and Side Effects: Despite its efficacy, CAR T-cell therapy can be associated with side effects such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity. Managing these side effects and improving the therapy's safety profile are ongoing research areas.",
    "administration": "IVIG can be administered intravenously with a dosage of 0.4 g/kg for 5 days to treat Guillain–Barré syndrome, but the dose varies depending on the pathology. Low-dose cyclophosphamide has had a more significant impact on cell-mediated immunity. In humans, a low-dose bolus of 600 mg/m B-cells decreases more than T-cells, and among T-cells, the CD8 subset diminishes more than CD4 cells.",
    "adverse_effects": "Adverse effects of immunotherapy include:\n\nCyclophosphamide and chlorambucil include bone marrow toxicity; therefore, leukopenia requires monitoring.\nAzathioprine produces reductions of both T and B-lymphocytes.\nGiving transfer factor requires caution in patients with Type I hypersensitivity reactions to prevent anaphylaxis.\nInterleukins must be given in a low dose to prevent side effects and decrease morbidity.\nGlucocorticoid therapy causes negative calcium balance, leading to osteoporosis, increased appetite, central obesity, impaired wound healing, increased risk of infection, suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and growth arrest in children. Other side effects include myopathy, avascular necrosis, hypertension, plethora, hyperlipidemia, and edema.\nAdverse effects of NSAID therapy include gastritis, duodenal and gastric ulcers, decreased creatinine clearance, acute renal failure, interstitial nephritis, confusion, memory loss, and personality changes, especially in older patients."
