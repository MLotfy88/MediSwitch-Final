These reactions are characterized by spastic contraction of discrete muscle groups and may include torticollis, opisthotonos, carpopedal spasm, trismus, difficulty swallowing, perioral spasms with protrusion of the tongue, and oculogyric crisis.  Onset is usually within 24 to 96 hours following initiation of therapy or an increase in dosage.  Risk factors include young age, male gender, use of high-potency agents (e.g., fluphenazine, perphenazine, trifluoperazine), high dosages, and IM administration.  Therapy with phenothiazines should be administered cautiously in patients, particularly children, with hypocalcemia or severe dehydration, since these patients may be more susceptible to dystonic reactions.  Most symptoms subside within a few hours and are almost always reversible within 24 to 48 hours following withdrawal of therapy.

Other reported adverse cardiovascular effects include edema, thrombosis, and ECG abnormalities such as PR and QT interval prolongation, diffuse T-wave flattening, and ST segment depression.  Therapy with phenothiazines should be avoided or otherwise administered cautiously in patients with severe cardiovascular disease, pheochromocytoma, a predisposition to hypotension, or conditions that could be exacerbated by hypotension such as a history of myocardial infarction, angina, or ischemic stroke.  Close monitoring of cardiovascular status, including ECG changes, is recommended at all dosages.  If parenteral therapy is given, patients should be in a supine position during administration and for at least 30 to 60 minutes afterwards.  Patients who experience orthostatic hypotension should be cautioned not to rise too abruptly.

Onset is usually within 24 to 96 hours following initiation of therapy or an increase in dosage.

Elderly patients, particularly women, are most susceptible.  Also, propylpiperazine derivatives like fluphenazine, perphenazine, prochlorperazine, and trifluoperazine may be more likely to induce this syndrome.  Both the risk of developing TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible increase with the duration and total cumulative dose of phenothiazine therapy administered.  However, patients may infrequently develop symptoms after relatively brief treatment periods at low dosages.  If TD occurs during phenothiazine therapy, prompt withdrawal of the offending agent or at least a lowering of the dosage should be considered.  TD symptoms usually become more severe after drug discontinuation or a dosage reduction, but may gradually improve over months to years.  In patients with preexisting drug-induced TD, initiating or increasing the dosage of phenothiazine therapy may temporarily mask the symptoms of TD but may eventually worsen the condition.  The newer, atypical neuroleptic agents (e.g., risperidone, quetiapine, olanzapine) tend to be associated with a substantially reduced risk of inducing TD and are considered the drugs of choice in patients being treated for psychosis.', '2', 'Yassa R, Dimitry R "Single phenothiazines and tardive dyskinesia."
