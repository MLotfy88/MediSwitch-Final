Thus, clinically significant interactions would most likely be expected with drugs that have low oral bioavailability due to significant intestinal CYP450 3A4-mediated first-pass metabolism (e.g., buspirone, cyclosporine, lovastatin, midazolam, saquinavir, simvastatin, sirolimus, tacrolimus, triazolam, calcium channel blockers). However, the potential for interaction should be considered with any drug metabolized by CYP450 3A4, especially given the high degree of interpatient variability with respect to CYP450-mediated metabolism. Pharmacologic response to these drugs may be altered and should be monitored more closely whenever modafinil or armodafinil is added to or withdrawn from therapy.

Otherwise, a dosage reduction, slower titration, or even discontinuation of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor should be considered. For patients who are already receiving an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor with anticholinergic agents, every attempt should be made to discontinue the latter or substitute them with less anticholinergic alternatives.

The diagnosis can be confirmed by an elevated methemoglobin level of at least 10% using co-oximetry.  Methemoglobin concentrations greater than 10% of total hemoglobin will typically cause cyanosis, and levels over 70% are frequently fatal.  However, symptom severity is not always related to methemoglobin levels.  Mild cases often respond to withdrawal of offending agents and symptomatic support.  If a patient does not respond to administration of oxygen, clinically significant or symptomatic methemoglobinemia can be treated with methylene blue 1 to 2 mg/kg by slow intravenous injection over 5 to 10 minutes, which may be repeated within 30 to 60 minutes if necessary.  Higher dosages of methylene blue (usually greater than 7 mg/kg) should be avoided, as it can paradoxically exacerbate methemoglobinemia.

Early warning signs of central nervous system toxicity may include restlessness, anxiety, incoherent speech, dizziness, lightheadedness, numbness and tingling of the mouth and lips, metallic taste, tinnitus, blurred vision, tremors, twitching, depression, and drowsiness.

      "management_text": "Close monitoring for signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia is recommended if local anesthetics must be used with other methemoglobin-inducing agents.  Signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia may occur immediately or hours after drug exposure.  Patients or their caregivers should be advised to seek medical attention if they notice signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia (e.g., cyanotic skin discoloration, abnormal blood coloration, nausea, headache, dizziness, lightheadedness, lethargy, fatigue, dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia, palpitation, anxiety, and confusion).  In severe cases, patients may progress to central nervous system depression, stupor, seizures, acidosis, cardiac arrhythmias, syncope, shock, coma, and death.  Methemoglobinemia should be considered if central cyanosis is unresponsive to oxygen.  Calculated oxygen saturation and pulse oximetry are generally not accurate in the setting of methemoglobinemia.  The diagnosis can be confirmed by an elevated methemoglobin level of at least 10% using co-oximetry.  Methemoglobin concentrations greater than 10% of total hemoglobin will typically cause cyanosis, and levels over 70% are frequently fatal.  However, symptom severity is not always related to methemoglobin levels.  Mild cases often respond to withdrawal of offending agents and symptomatic support.  If a patient does not respond to administration of oxygen, clinically significant or symptomatic methemoglobinemia can be treated with methylene blue 1 to 2 mg/kg by slow intravenous injection over 5 to 10 minutes, which may be repeated within 30 to 60 minutes if necessary.  Higher dosages of methylene blue (usually greater than 7 mg/kg) should be avoided, as it can paradoxically exacerbate methemoglobinemia.  Additionally, methylene blue is ineffective and can cause hemolytic anemia in patients with G6PD deficiency.  These patients may be treated with exchange transfusion, dialysis, and/or hyperbaric oxygenation in addition to symptomatic support.",
