Treatment with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists has been associated with dose-dependent prolongation of the QT interval.

In addition, the potential risk for serotonin syndrome should be considered even when administering serotonergic agents sequentially, as some agents may demonstrate a prolonged elimination half-life. If serotonin syndrome develops or is suspected during the course of therapy, all serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately and supportive care rendered as necessary. Moderately ill patients may also benefit from the administration of a serotonin antagonist (e.g., cyproheptadine, chlorpromazine). Severe cases should be managed under consultation with a toxicologist and may require sedation, neuromuscular paralysis, intubation, and mechanical ventilation in addition to the other measures. Due to the potential for additive effects on the QT interval, ECG monitoring may also be appropriate when 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are used with certain antidepressants or lithium.
