Postganglionic adrenergic blocking agents such as guanadrel, guanethidine, and rauwolfia alkaloids work by depleting catecholamine stores from adrenergic nerve endings.  Therefore, they may sensitize adrenergic receptors to direct-acting sympathomimetics, but blunt the effects of indirect-acting agents whose activity is mediated through the release of catecholamines.  Guanethidine and reserpine have been reported to attenuate the pharmacologic effects (mydriasis, pressor response) induced by ephedrine and dopamine, both of which exhibit direct and indirect sympathomimetic activities (i.e., mixed-acting).

Postganglionic adrenergic blocking agents such as guanadrel, guanethidine, and rauwolfia alkaloids work by depleting catecholamine stores from adrenergic nerve endings.  Therefore, they may sensitize adrenergic receptors to direct-acting sympathomimetics, but blunt the effects of indirect-acting agents whose activity is mediated through the release of catecholamines.  Guanethidine and reserpine have been reported to attenuate the pharmacologic effects (mydriasis, pressor response) induced by ephedrine and dopamine, both of which exhibit direct and indirect sympathomimetic activities (i.e., mixed-acting).  However, guanethidine intensified the mydriasis produced by phenylephrine, which is also thought to be mixed-acting.

Otherwise, close monitoring of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is recommended if coadministration is required.  The ANC should be measured prior to initiating deferiprone and weekly during therapy.  The manufacturer recommends that treatment be interrupted if neutropenia (ANC between 0.5 and 1.5 x 10^9/L) or infection develops.  Patients should be advised to immediately discontinue deferiprone as well as all other medications with a potential to cause neutropenia and seek medical attention if they experience symptoms indicative of infection such as fever, sore throat, and flu-like symptoms.  A complete blood cell (CBC) count, including a white blood cell (WBC) count corrected for the presence of nucleated red blood cells, an absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and a platelet count should be obtained daily until recovery.  For patients who develop agranulocytosis (ANC less than 0.5 x 10^9/L), hospitalization should be considered, and deferiprone should not be resumed following recovery unless potential benefits outweigh the risks.
