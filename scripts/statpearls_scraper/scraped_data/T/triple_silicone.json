    "clinical_significance": "The ultimate goal of a prosthetic limb is to enable a patient to fully return to their routine activity. For younger patients, the goals may be activities of daily living and various sports.\n[12]\nThese goals may be to return to work for older patients and have successful functioning at a job. A clinical evaluation of the significance of the prosthetic limb can be obtained from a questionnaire with a mixture of performance tests and self-reported quality questions.\n[12]\n\nAnother clinically significant indicator is dynamic balance, as evaluated by a four-square step test, socket comfort, pain, and distance walked in a 6-minute test. Mobility assessments can be performed pre-fitting and post-fitting to check the speed of ambulation. A well-fitted prosthetic limb can have a huge positive impact on improving quality of life and patient care. Quality of life has been shown to significantly improve after lower limb amputation with prosthetic limb use while in the inpatient rehabilitation setting and after 3 months time.\n[13]\nAlso, quality of life is highly associated with psychosocial factors such as body image and lower-limb pain.\n[13]\nIn summary, prosthetic limbs can greatly impact patient care with improvements in function and quality of life.",
    "monitoring": "Physical therapists, orthotists, and prosthetists must all monitor and communicate any issues related to a prosthetic limb. Interprofessional communication is vital to make sure each team member is informed when issues arise, such as a poor-fitting prosthesis or functional limitations of the patient, and the issues are addressed via a multidisciplinary approach."
