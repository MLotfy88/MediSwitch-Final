Patients should be closely monitored for symptoms of the serotonin syndrome during treatment. Particular caution is advised when initiating or increasing the dosages of these agents. The potential risk for serotonin syndrome should be considered even when administering serotonergic agents sequentially, as some agents may demonstrate a prolonged elimination half-life. For example, a 5-week washout period is recommended following use of fluoxetine and 3 weeks following use of vortioxetine before administering another serotonergic agent such as sibutramine. At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of other serotonergic agents and initiation of treatment with sibutramine. If serotonin syndrome develops or is suspected during the course of therapy, all serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately and supportive care rendered as necessary. Moderately ill patients may also benefit from the administration of a serotonin antagonist (e.g., cyproheptadine, chlorpromazine).

Symptoms of hypoglycemia such as tremor and tachycardia may be absent, making it more difficult for patients to recognize an oncoming episode.

Prolonged and severe hypoglycemia may occur, although these events have rarely been reported. Significant increases in blood pressure and bradycardia can also occur during hypoglycemia in diabetics treated with insulin and beta-blockers due to antagonism of epinephrine's effect on beta-2 adrenergic receptors, which leads to unopposed alpha-adrenergic effects including vasoconstriction.

Some authorities recommend avoiding concomitant use of nilotinib during and for 2 weeks after treatment with itraconazole. Should treatment with a potent inhibitor be required, the manufacturer recommends that nilotinib therapy be withheld temporarily. If concomitant use is unavoidable, a reduction of the nilotinib dosage to 400 mg once daily should be considered. Based on pharmacokinetic studies, this dosage is predicted to adjust the nilotinib systemic exposure (AUC) to the range observed without inhibitors. However, clinical data are lacking. Patients should have frequent ECGs and be monitored for arrhythmias when QT interval is prolonged. A QTc interval exceeding 480 msec will require suspension of nilotinib therapy and immediate action to correct any concomitant risk factors before resuming treatment.

The risk is thought to extend to teriflunomide, its principal active metabolite, because recommended dosages of both result in a similar range of plasma concentrations of teriflunomide. Serious infections including sepsis, as well as opportunistic infections like Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis, and aspergillosis have been reported with the use of leflunomide, particularly in patients on concomitant hematotoxic therapy. Agents that may be significantly immuno- or myelosuppressive include antineoplastic agents, radiation, zidovudine, linezolid, some antirheumatic agents, high dosages of corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic agents , and long-term topical or inhaled corticosteroids. Rare cases of pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia have also occurred with leflunomide alone, but were most frequent in the presence of concomitant or recent use of methotrexate or other myelotoxic agents. Due to the prolonged elimination half-life of leflunomide's active metabolite, an interaction may occur even when hematotoxic agents are initiated after the discontinuation of leflunomide.
