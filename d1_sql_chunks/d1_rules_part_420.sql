Naltrexone should also not be given to patients in acute opioid withdrawal. In an urgent situation when analgesia may be required in a patient who has received full blocking doses of naltrexone, consideration should be given to regional analgesia, conscious sedation with a benzodiazepine, use of non-opioid analgesics, or general anesthesia. If opioid analgesia is required, the amount of opioid needed may be greater than usual, and the resulting respiratory depression may be deeper and more prolonged. A rapidly-acting opioid analgesic that minimizes the duration of respiratory depression is preferred. Clinicians should be aware that reversal of full naltrexone blockade by administration of large doses of opiates can cause histamine release. Therefore, patients may experience non-opioid receptor-mediated effects such as facial swelling, itching, generalized erythema, and bronchoconstriction. Irrespective of the drug chosen to reverse naltrexone blockade, the patient should be monitored closely by appropriately trained personnel in a setting equipped and staffed for cardiopulmonary resuscitation.', 'Antagonism', NULL, NULL, 'Major', NULL, 'DDInter', 'pharmacodynamic', 1767317476);
