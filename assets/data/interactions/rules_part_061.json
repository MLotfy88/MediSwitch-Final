In an urgent situation when analgesia may be required in a patient who has received full blocking doses of naltrexone, consideration should be given to regional analgesia, conscious sedation with a benzodiazepine, use of non-opioid analgesics, or general anesthesia. If opioid analgesia is required, the amount of opioid needed may be greater than usual, and the resulting respiratory depression may be deeper and more prolonged. A rapidly-acting opioid analgesic that minimizes the duration of respiratory depression is preferred. Clinicians should be aware that reversal of full naltrexone blockade by administration of large doses of opiates can cause histamine release. Therefore, patients may experience non-opioid receptor-mediated effects such as facial swelling, itching, generalized erythema, and bronchoconstriction.

Serotonin syndrome is a rare but serious and potentially fatal condition thought to result from hyperstimulation of brainstem 5-HT1A and 2A receptors. Symptoms of the serotonin syndrome may include mental status changes such as irritability, altered consciousness, confusion, hallucinations, and coma; autonomic dysfunction such as tachycardia, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, shivering, blood pressure lability, and mydriasis; neuromuscular abnormalities such as hyperreflexia, myoclonus, tremor, rigidity, and ataxia; and gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Since many serotonergic agents can also cause central nervous system depression, concomitant use with opioids may result in increased sedation and impairment of judgment, thinking, and psychomotor skills.",
      "management_text": "Caution is advised when opioids are used concomitantly with serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), other antidepressants/psychotropic agents (e.g., amoxapine, buspirone, lithium, maprotiline, mirtazepine, nefazodone, trazodone, vilazodone), 5-HT1 receptor agonists (triptans), 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, cyclobenzaprine, dextromethorphan, 5-hydroxytryptophan, and St. John's wort. Patients should be monitored for symptoms of the serotonin syndrome during treatment. If serotonin syndrome develops or is suspected during the course of therapy, all serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately and supportive care rendered as necessary.",
