      "text": "Tar is a product of the distillation of coal.\n[1]\nAsphalt (now more commonly used than tar) and tar are both forms of\nbitumen\nCurrently used mainly for roofing and road paving\nWhen used for these purposes, tar/asphalt is heated to between 140-190°C (for paving) and 210-270°C (for roofing)\n[1]\nInjuries limited almost exclusively to occupational exposure in these fields\nTar/asphalt is highly viscous and sticks to skin, making it difficult to remove and leading to more severe burns\nTar itself is sterile, but dead tissue underneath is not",
