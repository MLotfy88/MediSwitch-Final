      "text": "Also known as \"the bends\"\nDissolved nitrogen (and occasionally helium) comes out of solution and forms bubbles in blood and tissue\nOccurs in rapid ascent in diving, and more rarely in military operations rapid ascent in high altitude aviation or hypobarics training\nAlthough decompression sickness can occur in both astronauts and divers, with similar physiology, the processes of disease differ due to a\nreduction in ambient pressure\nin space compared to an increase in ambient pressure when diving.",

This can affect divers at any depth, including commonly-seen recreational diving depths of 20m/60ft or less.\nIncreased inhaled partial pressures of oxygen, generally beyond 1.4-1.6atm, increases risk of oxygen toxicity. This is typically not a substantial risk in common depths of recreational divers at 20m/60ft of depth or less, but can be for more advanced divers at deeper depths.",
