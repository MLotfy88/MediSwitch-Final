    "indications": "Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), formerly Osler-Weber-Rendu, is an inherited (autosomal dominant) disease that results in malformed blood vessels (see\nImage.\nTelangiectasia on the Tongue). The disease is named after the physicians who first independently described the condition: Henri Jules Louis Marie Rendu in 1896, William Osler in 1901, and Frederick Parkes Weber in 1907.\n[1]\nThe malformations typically manifest as mucocutaneous telangiectasias and visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).\n[2]\nThese vascular malformations are responsible for much of the clinical bleeding associated with this disease, ranging from mild epistaxis to life-threatening intracranial bleeds.\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\nSome patients with HHT develop pulmonary hypertension, a prothrombotic state, or immune dysfunction.\n[6]\nThe earliest clinical sign of HHT, often occurring by the second decade of life, is recurrent epistaxis. Telangiectasias, which are dilated blood vessels, are frequently present on the skin and buccal mucosa in the third decade of life. The number of telangiectasias increases with age, accompanied by increased frequency of epistaxis or gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, leading to anemia, poorer quality of life, and increased healthcare resource utilization, including iron or blood transfusions and hospitalizations.\n[7]",
    "mechanism": "Genes comprise DNA, which encodes for distinct proteins that perform a specific function in the body. Through transcription, the DNA is converted into messenger RNA (mRNA) and then translated into a protein. HHT is an autosomal dominant disorder affecting blood vessels within multiple organ systems. The condition is suspected of haploinsufficiency, where 1 functional gene copy cannot produce the required protein to preserve function.\n[2]\nIn 97% of patients with a definite clinical HHT diagnosis, a causative mutation is identified in 1 of 3 genes described below.\n[8]\nThese mutations disrupt signaling by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-B), essential for maintaining vascular integrity.\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n\nHHT Type I (HHT1)\n\nHHT1 stems from mutations in the gene ENG, which codes for endoglin on chromosome 9.\n[12]\nEndoglin is a membrane glycoprotein part of the tumor growth factor-beta (TGF-B) receptor complex needed for vascular integrity.\n\nHHT Type 2 (HHT2)\n\nHHT2 results from Activin A receptor-like type I (ACVRL1) mutations, which codes for the protein activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) on chromosome 12.\n[13]\nALK1 is a type 1 cell-surface receptor for the TGF-B superfamily and is found on the surface of cells, particularly on the lining of developing arteries.\n[14]\n\nHHT Associated with Juvenile Polyposis (JPHT or JP-HHT)\n\nJPHT is due to a mutation in the gene Mothers Against Decapentaplegic homolog 4 (MADH4) that codes for the transcription factor SMAD4, a critical downstream effector of TGF-B signaling.\n[15]\nThe mutations in JPHT are located on the last 4 exons of\nSmad4\nand include several mutation types, including nonsense, missense, frameshift, and\nde novo\n.\n[6]\nThe distribution in gene mutations among HHT patients is predominantly ENG (61%), followed by ACVRL1 (37%), and then MADH4 (2%). Over 600 mutations, including deletions, missense, nonsense, and insertions, have also been identified in ENG or ACVR genes.",
    "monitoring": "Genetic Testing\n\nGenetic mutation testing should be done to confirm a diagnosis of HHT, including patients who meet 1-2 of the Curaçao criteria or young children with affected parents who are yet to develop the clinical manifestations.\n[19]\nInitial genetic testing should screen for the 3 most prevalent mutations: ENG, ACVRL1, and SMAD4. Testing should also be extended to family members. It is important to note that genetic mutations are not identified in up to 10 to 15% of HHT families, and a negative genetic test does not exclude the diagnosis of HHT. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, additional tests can be done to evaluate for other HHT manifestations. Screening should be done, regardless of a patient’s clinical symptoms, due to the danger of undiagnosed silent AVMs.\n\nAncillary Tests for Visceral AVMs\n\nPulmonary AVMs are often silent but can lead to strokes, massive hemoptysis, spontaneous hemothorax, transient ischemic attacks, and brain abscesses.\n[22]\nSensitive screening tests to detect pulmonary AVMs include thoracic CT scan and transthoracic contrast/bubble echocardiography; both modalities can also detect pulmonary hypertension. Most screening protocols use contrast echocardiography as a first-line test, followed by a thoracic CT to determine the anatomic location and if embolization is viable. Chest X-rays, right-to-left shunt measurements, and blood oxygen measurements are less sensitive to identifying the presence of pulmonary AVMs.\n\nMultiple cerebral AVMs are predictive of HHT.\n[28]\nThe role of screening remains controversial due to the overall low risk, albeit significant morbidity or mortality, of hemorrhage. Additionally, the risks associated with treating asymptomatic cerebral AVMs potentially outweigh the benefits. An MRI brain with and without contrast is initially recommended for patients with cerebral symptoms, who have a known unstable cerebral aneurysm, or a family member who has had a cerebral hemorrhage since familial aneurysms have a higher risk of hemorrhage.\n[29]\nThe gold standard for diagnosing and treating cerebral AVMs is diagnostic angiography, which carries a 0.5% risk of stroke.\n[25]\n\nRoutine gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is not typically performed. However, patients with anemia disproportionate to the severity of epistaxis or with a history of GI bleeding should undergo an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to detect and treat GI AVMs.\n[9]\n[22]\nIf EGD is inconclusive, capsule endoscopy can be considered. Additionally, patients with the JPHT form of HHT should have a screening colonoscopy starting at the age of 15 due to a higher risk of colon cancer. This should be repeated every 3 years if no colon polyps are found. If polyps are detected, the patient should undergo yearly EGD and colonoscopy.\n[22]\nScreening for asymptomatic hepatic AVMs with Doppler ultrasonography is recommended because it is non-invasive and can improve patient management and outcomes. While Doppler ultrasonography is ideal due to its accuracy, cost, safety, and tolerability, depending on resources available and operator expertise, patients can be screened by alternate means, such as multiphase contrast CT or MRI.\n[19]\n[6]\n\nLaboratory Evaluation\n\nLaboratory testing should be done before all surgical interventions, including a complete blood count and a type and screen or type and crossmatch.\n[9]\nFurthermore, all adults, regardless of symptoms and children with recurrent bleeding, should have annual complete blood count and ferritin levels measured to screen for iron deficiency anemia. If the patient is anemic but ferritin is normal, further workup with serum iron, transferrin saturation, and total iron-binding capacity should be performed.\n[19]\n[22]\nHHT patients with severe epistaxis demonstrate microcytic iron deficiency anemia with low ferritin and elevated transferrin.\n[9]\n\nPregnancy\n\nPregnant women with HHT should have access to a multidisciplinary maternal-fetal team with knowledge of HHT, and pre-conception and prenatal diagnostic options should be discussed. Asymptomatic pregnant women should have an agitated saline transthoracic contrast echocardiography (TTCE) or a diagnostic low-dose chest CT without contrast for pulmonary AVMs. Any intervention should be delayed until the 2nd trimester.\n[22]\nSpinal AVMs can be detected with a spinal MRI and can be considered in pregnant women, particularly if epidural anesthesia is considered.\n[6]\nHowever, an expert consensus panel recommended against withholding an epidural, as risks of complications are unsubstantiated. Pregnant women with symptomatic cerebral AVMs or previous cerebral hemorrhage should have an unenhanced MRI in the second trimester. For asymptomatic cerebral AVMs, vaginal delivery may be attempted. However, for HHT patients with symptomatic cerebral AVMs or prior hemorrhage, a cesarean section should be considered to avoid the strain associated with delivering vaginally.\n[22]",
    "administration": "Treatment options are tailored to the patient, and the best approach is based on local versus systemic measures. Due to the few randomized trials, there are no standard therapies for HHT. Management of HHT focuses on supportive care, preventing complications, and reducing symptom severity.\n\nEpistaxis\n\nEpistaxis prevention is the primary goal for HHT-related nosebleeds. Preventative measures include topical moisturizers and emollients, nasal hygiene with humidifiers and saline irrigations, and avoiding triggers and blood thinners.\n[30]\n[19]\nConservative management of ongoing epistaxis includes topical decongestant spray, manual pressure, absorbable nasal packing, and chemical cauterization with silver nitrate.\n[9]\nNon-dissolvable nasal packing should be avoided due to the risk of increased mucosal trauma with insertion and removal of the packing. Epistaxis refractory to conservative measures may require surgical or endovascular interventions.\n[19]\nOther medical interventions targeting the molecular biology of the disease have been used – many of which have gained and lost favor. These medical treatments aim to reduce nosebleeds' frequency, volume, and severity and improve quality of life. These topical and oral agents include estrogen agents (tamoxifen, raloxifene, and estriol ointment), tranexamic acid, thalidomide, beta-blockers (timolol or propranolol), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors (bevacizumab).\n[9]\n[31]\nOral tranexamic acid is a possible option for treating HHT-epistaxis refractory to moisturizing topical therapies.\n[32]\nTwo randomized control trials evaluating oral tranexamic acid for HHT-related epistaxis demonstrated a 17.3% reduction in epistaxis duration and a 54% reduction in epistaxis intensity.\n[33]\n[34]\n\nSurgical interventions focused on prevention and reducing severity include electrosurgical plasma coagulation, potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser photocoagulation, and sclerotherapy with sodium tetradecyl sulfate.\n[35]\nLaser photocoagulation improves the quality of life outcomes and decreases the frequency and severity of epistaxis. Other surgical interventions for moderate to severe epistaxis include septodermoplasty and Young’s procedure. Septodermoplasty involves removing the sinonasal mucosal and replacement with a split-thickness skin graft.\n[36]\nAfter the surgery, epistaxis is reduced for at least 2 years, though the problem typically recurs with time as telangiectasias affect the graft. This procedure has lost favor among many. Young’s technically reversible procedure involves the closure of 1 or both nostrils using mucocutaneous flaps, resulting in complete obstruction of airflow through the nose and resolution of epistaxis.\n[37]\nAfter Young’s procedure, patients suffer hyposmia and hypogeusia but also have complete cessation of epistaxis. This procedure is reserved for severe, life-threatening epistaxis and is relatively uncommon.\n\nAnemia and Anticoagulation\n\nAll patients with iron deficiency and anemia require iron replacement, either orally or intravenously, if the oral form is not absorbed or well-tolerated. Oral replacement starts with 35 to 65 mg of elemental iron daily, taken 2 hours prior or 1 hour after meals. IV iron infusions may be required regularly, starting at 1 gm in a single dose or divided infusions for refractory or severe anemia.\n[38]\nBlood transfusions should be considered in the following situations: hemodynamic shock, comorbidities requiring a higher hemoglobin baseline before surgery or pregnancy, or inadequate hemoglobin levels despite iron transfusions. Anticoagulation is permissible in HHT patients.\n[39]\nVitamin K antagonists and unfractionated and low-molecular-weight heparins are preferred and better than direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Currently, there is more literature regarding tolerance with heparin and warfarin in HHT patients. Warfarin is the oral anticoagulant of choice because of its tolerance and the existence of a reversal agent. Finally, a small retrospective study evaluating DOAC showed increased HHT-related epistaxis while on DOACs.\n[40]\nIf dual therapy is required, the duration of treatment should be minimized, and patients should be closely observed.\n\nGI Bleeding\n\nPatients with mild to moderate HHT-related GI bleeding can be managed with iron replacement. For severe cases, hemoglobin can be managed with scheduled iron replacement and transfusions. For patients with moderate to severe GI bleeding refractory to iron replacement and transfusions, there is moderate evidence for intravenous bevacizumab or other systemic antiangiogenic therapy and inadequate evidence for oral antifibrinolytics. Endoscopic argon plasma coagulation is an option to address bleeding and non-bleeding lesions during upper GI endoscopy; however, the evidence for this is low.\n[22]\n\nPulmonary AVMs (PAVMs)\n\nDetection and treatment of asymptomatic PAVM are recommended due to associated neurological risks, including brain abscesses and paradoxical embolic strokes. The mainstay treatment of PAVMs is transcatheter embolization with embolic material such as metallic coils and Amplatzer vascular plugs.\n[25]\n[22]\n[41]\nA CT chest is recommended 3 to 6 months after the procedure to ensure recanalization of the occluded feeding artery did not occur. Surgery is reserved only for life-threatening hemorrhage. Similarly, lung transplantation is limited to patients with diffuse bilateral disease refractory to other treatment modalities. There is an association between oral microorganisms and PAVM-associated brain abscesses.\n[42]\nThe pulmonary capillary bed filters small thrombi and bacteria that enter the bloodstream. Since the capillary bed is bypassed in PAVMs, a direct right-to-left shunt effectively forms, allowing paradoxical emboli to pass and cause brain abscesses or strokes.\n[43]\nThus, antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for any procedure that carries a risk of bacteremia, particularly dental procedures. Finally, patients with PAVMs should be followed long-term to detect the growth of untreated PAVMs and reperfusion of treated PAVMS.\n\nHepatic AVMs (HAVMs)\n\nManagement of HAVMs is based on the symptoms and type of complications. HHT patients with HAVMs may have high-output cardiac failure, portal hypertension, or cirrhosis, which are managed medically. High-output cardiac failure is treated with blood transfusions for anemia, salt and fluid restriction, beta-blockers, and diuretics. Intravenous bevacizumab can be considered for patients with high-output cardiac failure who fail initial management. Portal hypertension and cirrhosis are treated with salt and fluid restriction, diuretics, and paracentesis. Liver transplantation is reserved for those with symptomatic HAVMs who are refractory to medical management.\n[44]\nFinally, hepatic artery embolization should be avoided since the procedure is only temporizing and carries high morbidity and mortality.\n\nCerebral AVMs (CAVMs)\n\nHHT-related CAVMs are low-grade, usually small, and cortically located with superficial venous drainage. Patients symptomatic from CAVMs should be referred to a center with neurovascular expertise. The natural history of CAVMs associated with HHT is slightly more favorable than sporadic AVMs, with a yearly rupture rate of 1.3% vs. 2.2%.\n[45]\n[46]\nAs such, conservative management should be considered for CAVMs in HHT patients. Furthermore, although there are advances in interventional therapies for CAVMs, the risks still outweigh these benefits. The ARUBA trial evaluated interventional versus medical therapy for 223 non-HHT patients with CAVMs and found the risk of stroke or death to be 3 times higher (30.7% vs. 10.1%) in the interventional arm.\n[46]\nFor HHT patients with symptomatic CAVMs or risk factors, such as a family history of cerebral hemorrhage, treatment options are embolization, microsurgery, stereotactic radiation, or a combination of these modalities. Microsurgery for low-grade lesions (Spetzler-Martin grade I or II) can be effective. Spetzler-Martin grading scale estimates the risk of open surgery for cerebral AVMs. A grade 1 AVM describes a small, superficial lesion located in a non-critical area of the brain and is considered low risk for surgery. A grade 6 AVM is non-operable.\n[47]\nOne series demonstrated a 100% obliteration rate with a 3.2% rate of neurologic deficits and 0% mortality with microsurgery.\n[48]\nGamma knife surgery also has a similar risk profile with 100% obliteration rates for lesions < 1 mL in volume. For CAVMs that are poor surgical candidates, stereotactic radiosurgery can be considered but has a lower cure rate for larger lesions.\n[49]\nEmbolization alone is ineffective in addressing CAVMs but could be a helpful adjunct with surgery or stereotactic radiation.",
