    "indications": "For contraindications, factors to consider are renal function, pregnancy, and neuromuscular disease. It is crucial to assess renal function before giving magnesium. Renal failure can cause decreased magnesium excretion, which can lead to toxicity. Closely monitor magnesium levels in patients with reduced renal function.\n[2]\nPatients with neuromuscular disease, such as myasthenia gravis, must be closely monitored to see if they are being given magnesium. Magnesium inhibits the release of acetylcholine, which can cause deterioration. Magnesium is considered class D for pregnancy. Skeletal demineralization, hypocalcemia, and hypermagnesemia are seen with long-term use, more than 5 to 7 days, of magnesium, which is necessary for pre-term labor treatment. There are no contraindications for magnesium supplements with other prescriptions. However, various drugs increase or decrease the concentration of either magnesium or the prescribed medication. Magnesium may be used in pregnancy and lactation; there is no expected risk of fetal or infant harm based on limited data in humans.",
    "mechanism": "Like other electrolytes, magnesium's role in the body is diverse and complex. Its action mechanism depends on which organ system is involved and its formulation.\nPhysiology of Magnesium\n\nMagnesium is the fourth most common cation in the body. Most magnesium is intracellular; it is the second most common intracellular cation following potassium. Magnesium plays a vital role in over 300 reactions involving metabolism. It involves hormone receptor binding, muscle contraction, neural activity, neurotransmitter release, vasomotor tone, and cardiac excitability. It is necessary to transport potassium and calcium across the cell membrane actively. ATP is dependent on magnesium for proper functioning.\n[5]\n\nEffects of Magnesium\n\nGastrointestinal\n\nOral magnesium promotes defecation via the osmotic retention of fluids. It is also used in over-the-counter antacids.\n[5]\n\nCardiovascular\n\nMagnesium acts as a natural calcium channel blocker, a cofactor of the Na-K-ATP pump. Magnesium helps control atrioventricular node conduction. Therefore, hypomagnesemia can cause myocardial excitability, resulting in arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia and torsades de pointes.\n[5]\n\nNeurological system\n\nMagnesium depresses the central nervous system while producing anticonvulsant effects. At neuromuscular junctions, it inhibits the release of acetylcholine, thus blocking peripheral neuromuscular transmission.\n[5]\n\nReproductive system\n\nMagnesium is used as a tocolytic during pre-term labor. Magnesium stimulates calcium reuptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which promotes muscle relaxation and vasodilation. For pre-term labor, magnesium decreases the calcium within the uterine muscle.\n[5]\n\nMusculoskeletal system\n\nMagnesium is a cofactor of parathyroid hormone synthesis. With hypomagnesemia, concurrent hypoparathyroidism ensues. Hypoparathyroidism can lead to decreased calcium and eventually lead to osteopenia or osteoporosis.\n[5]\n\nRespiratory system\n\nMagnesium administration can cause bronchial smooth muscle relaxation. The cause of smooth muscle relaxation is unclear. It is thought to be either by inhibiting calcium, histamine, or acetylcholine release. There may also be a synergist effect with the concurrent use of beta-agonists.\n[5]\n\nHemostasis of magnesium\n\nRoughly 50% of magnesium is located in bone, 25% in muscle, and the remainder in soft tissue, serum, and red blood cells. Like other electrolytes, magnesium can be classified as ionized, protein-bound, or bound to anions. Ionized magnesium has the most biological activity. The intestine, bone, and kidney maintain magnesium homeostasis. Like calcium, magnesium is absorbed through the intestine, stored in the bone, and excreted through the kidneys. Magnesium absorption is inversely proportional to the concentration within the body; if there are low magnesium levels, more magnesium is absorbed.",
    "administration": "Magnesium can be administered in various ways. Dietary intake is the primary source of magnesium for a healthy individual. The recommended daily intake varies with gender and age. Green leafy vegetables, fish, legumes, and whole grains are good sources of magnesium. Magnesium comes in various salts and forms, including magnesium oxide, magnesium citrate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium hydroxide, and magnesium gluconate. Treatment can be via oral magnesium salts or intravenous or intramuscular magnesium sulfate. Intravenous or intramuscular magnesium sulfate is given for severe hypomagnesemia or those unable to tolerate or adhere to oral therapy. Patients with alcohol use disorder are treated empirically to avoid hypomagnesemia. The clinician must increase the dose for patients with renal insufficiency to adjust for the increase in renal loss.\n[5]\nThe clinician must also address concurrent hypokalemia or hypocalcemia.",
    "adverse_effects": "Adverse reactions are associated with magnesium’s effect on the neuromuscular and cardiovascular systems and can vary depending on the formulation. Effects can include the following:\n\nSerious Adverse Events:\n\nCardiovascular collapse\nRespiratory depression or paralysis\nHypothermia\nDepressed cardiac function\nPulmonary edema\n\nCommon Adverse Events:\n\nFlushing\nHypotension\nVasodilation\nImpaired reflexes\nAbdominal pain\nDiarrhea\nFlatulence\nNausea/vomiting\nRespiratory depression\nElectrolyte disorders (hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia)\nHypermagnesemia\n[9]\n\nHypermagnesemia can be a serious adverse event, particularly regarding cardiology effects; see the Toxicity section for more information.",
    "monitoring": "Hypermagnesemia may occur from overdose. While administering magnesium, the level of magnesium must be monitored. Serum magnesium levels and those of other electrolytes such as calcium and potassium can be monitored.",
    "toxicity": "Hypermagnesemia: Serum Magnesium Concentration Greater than 2.6 mg/dL\n\nHypermagnesemia is a potential effect of administering magnesium. If too much magnesium is administered too quickly, hypermagnesemia may ensue. Symptoms include vasodilation causing flushing, hypotension, hyporeflexia, and respiratory depression. With a magnesium concentration above 6 mg/dL, electrocardiogram changes can consist of PR prolongation, widening of QRS, and peaked T waves. Cardiac arrest occurs whenever levels are above 15 mg/dL.\n[7]\n[9]\n[5]\nHypermagnesemia is less common than hypomagnesemia. The most significant cause of hypermagnesemia is renal failure causing increased retention of magnesium. It can also occur in the overuse of magnesium-containing laxatives and antacids.\n[2]\nTreatment for hypermagnesemia includes calcium gluconate, diuresis, or dialysis. Maintaining circulatory and respiratory support for those with severe hypermagnesemia is important. Intravenous furosemide is the diuretic of choice, as it increases magnesium excretion.\n[10]\n[5]"
