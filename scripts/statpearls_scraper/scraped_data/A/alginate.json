    "clinical_significance": "Alginates in Wound Dressings\n\nAlginate hydrogels have extensive utilization as wound interfaces in dressings intended to support healing following burns, pressure ulcers, venous ulcers, and other exudative cutaneous wounds. While the indications of alginate wound dressings are different in each of these contexts, a few underlying principles are generally relevant. Because alginates allow for the relatively free diffusion of water and solutes, alginate dressings are thought to generate a relatively physiologic environment at the wound interface that encourages healing. Additionally, some research postulates that calcium release from alginate hydrogels crosslinked with calcium stimulates coagulative pathways and which results in a healing response. While alginate dressings see extensive use in wound healing, few well-controlled studies definitively link their usage to improvements in outcomes.\n[8]\nIt remains undetermined whether this is due to a lack of published evidence or a lack of benefit achieved with these dressings.\n\nAlginates in Encapsulation\n\nModern drug delivery systems often utilize a “carrier” construct that protects and facilitates the delivery of the intended therapeutic compound(s). Because of their flexibility, modifiability, and well-studied biocompatibility, alginate-based hydrogels are often candidates for this application.\n[9]\nTherapeutic agents ranging from insulin to doxorubicin to entire cells and tissues have been encapsulated within alginate, delivered into the physiologic environment, and studied in preclinical and clinical trials. Because alginates can crosslink with agents that are generally compatible with physiologic function (like calcium chloride solutions), cells and tissues can be added to alginates before crosslinking, making alginate hydrogels particularly advantageous biomaterial constructs for living cell and organoid encapsulation.\n[10]\n\nFor patients with extensive cutaneous wounds, healthcare staff should consider alginate dressings as a means of maintaining a moist and semi-physiologic wound environment. However, it bears mentioning that a systematic review has failed to substantiate the superiority of alginate dressings over other dressing types."
