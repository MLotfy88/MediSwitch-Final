The interaction may also occur with ophthalmically applied beta-blockers, which are systemically absorbed and can produce clinically significant systemic effects even at low or undetectable plasma levels. Due to opposing effects on beta-2 adrenergic receptors, propranolol has been used in the treatment of albuterol overdose.
