Do what is necessary to stop the burning process.\nAirway management is generally best deferred until the Tactical Field Care phase.\nStop life-threatening external hemorrhage if tactically feasible:\nDirect casualty to control hemorrhage by self-aid if able.\nUse a CoTCCC-recommended\ntourniquet\nfor hemorrhage that is anatomically amenable to\ntourniquet\napplication.\nApply the\ntourniquet\nproximal to the bleeding site, over the uniform, tighten, and move the casualty to cover.",
