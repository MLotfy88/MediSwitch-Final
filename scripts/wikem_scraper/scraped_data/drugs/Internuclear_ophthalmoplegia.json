      "text": "Focal neuro deficit\ncaused by injury or dysfunction of medial longitudinal fasciculus\nParamedian Pontine Reticular Formation (PPRF) is the conjugate gaze center for horizontal eye movements.

Abducens nucleus signals ipsilateral lateral rectus to contract and sends a second via MLF to contralateral oculomotor (CN III) nucleus, causing contraction on the contralateral medial rectus.\nAssociated with one and one-half syndrome (lesion involving the PPRF and ipsilateral MLF)",
