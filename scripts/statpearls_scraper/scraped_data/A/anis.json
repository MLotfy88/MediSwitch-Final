    "indications": "The major contraindication is the surgeon's skill, expertise, and experience. Other contraindications include those listed below:\n\nSubluxated or dislocated cataract with weak capsular support\nMicrocornea\nScleral thinning\nPeripheral corneal thinning\nLow endothelial cell count cases\nCiliary staphyloma\nScleral ectasia\nConjunctival scarring\nBleeding diathesis\n[18]",
    "clinical_significance": "MSICS has revolutionized cataract surgery in today's era, especially in low-income and developing countries. Large-scale studies have quoted similar long results of MSICS and phacoemulsification considering visual acuity and astigmatism.\n\nMSICS offers the advantage under challenging cases where an excellent outcome can be achieved without complication. MSICS has served as a stepping stone for performing good phacoemulsification as the majority of steps of both the surgeries are similar except for the trenching and emulsification in phacoemulsification. MSICS is more of a skill-based surgery that improves surgeons' tissue handling.\n[47]",
    "monitoring": "The nursing, the allied health staff, and the interprofessional team help in monitoring high-risk patients with systemic comorbidities, monitoring pediatric patients under general anesthesias, intubation, extubation, and vitals of physically ill patients requiring urgent cataract surgery.\n[48]"
