    "indications": "Contraindications for the use of hyaluronic acid filler include:\n\nHypersensitivity to hyaluronic acid or any of the formulation components.\nHistory of severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis to hyaluronic acid.\nHypersensitivity reaction to gram-positive bacterial proteins (for products derived from bacterial source).\nHypersensitivity reaction to lidocaine (for products containing lidocaine).\nBleeding disorder.\nInjection into sites other than the labeling recommended sites.\n\nContraindications for the use of intraarticular hyaluronic acid include:\n\nHypersensitivity to hyaluronic acid or any of the formulation components.\nHistory of severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis to hyaluronic acid.\nHypersensitivity reaction to gram-positive bacterial proteins (for products derived from bacterial source).\nInfections or skin diseases in the vicinity of the injection site or injection into a septic joint.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of hyaluronic acid injections in pregnant females, lactating females, and the pediatric population have not been established.",
    "mechanism": "Hyaluronic acid, a naturally occurring chemical, is a glycosaminoglycan polysaccharide composed of alternating residues of the monosaccharides d-glucuronic acid and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, which form a linear polysaccharide chain. In its pure form, hyaluronic acid is the same in all organisms and is not species or tissue-specific. Therefore, hyaluronic acid theoretically should not cause an immune response.\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n\nHyaluronic acid, a chief component of the extracellular matrix, is found throughout various human tissues such as the skin, eyes, connective tissue, and synovium. Due to hyaluronic acid's highly anionic proprieties, it can attract water to swell and create volume and provide structural support. Aging leads to decreased production of hyaluronic acid and collagen in the skin. Once the skin has lost its viscoelastic properties, overlying wrinkles begin to form. Hyaluronic acid dermal fillers work to counteract aging by replacing lost volume. In addition to this, hyaluronic acid fillers have also been shown to increase collagen production and affect fibroblast morphology.\n\nThe hyaluronic acid filler can classify as animal-derived or non-animal derived. Animal-derived fillers come from a rooster comb, and non-animal derived hyaluronic acid production occurs through biofermentation of\nStreptococcus\n. The hyaluronic acid filler can further be classified based on whether it is processed through particulate or non-particulate manufacturing. The particulate size determines the longevity of particulate manufactured hyaluronic acid filler, whereas cross-linking density determines the longevity of non-particulate manufactured hyaluronic acid filler.\n\nThe hyaluronic acid filler contains modified hyaluronic acid particles that are cross-linked, which allows for the production of a more concentrated hyaluronic acid that has greater resistance to chemical and physical degradation. During the degradation and breakdown of hyaluronic acid filler, water slowly takes its place, resulting in a less concentrated hyaluronic gel yet occupying the same amount of volume. This action is termed “isovolumetric degradation.” The effects of hyaluronic acid filler are last up to 4 to 6 months depending on location, a specific brand of filler used, and injection technique.\n\nThe mechanism of action of hyaluronic acid when used intra-articularly is similar. Hyaluronic acid is a naturally occurring part of the synovial fluid and cartilage, and in osteoarthritis, the concentration of hyaluronic acid decreases along with a decrease in the size of individual hyaluronic acid molecules, thus decreasing the viscosity of the synovial fluid. When injected into the joint, hyaluronic acid is cleared within several hours, with half-lives ranging from 17 hours to 1.5 days.\n[7]\nThe half-life is longer for purified or synthesized hyaluronic acid preparations with a large molecular weight.\n\nDespite such a short half-life, the clinical benefit, including pain relief from intraarticular hyaluronic injections, lasts several months. Several mechanisms have been proposed for this long-lasting efficacy of intraarticular hyaluronic acid injections. Injection of hyaluronic acid may stimulate the native synovial sites that produce hyaluronic acid. Anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects of hyaluronic acid have been demonstrated as well.\n[8]\nSeveral meta-analyses have been done to evaluate the efficacy of different hyaluronic acid preparations for osteoarthritis management, with varying results.\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\nThe overall consensus is that of small but significant symptomatic and long-lasting effects following a series of intraarticular hyaluronic acid injections.",
    "administration": "The hyaluronic acid filler is available in varying sized, preloaded syringes, and the concentration depends on the specific brand chosen.\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\nPreparation of the site should include removal of any makeup and cleansing with an antiseptic agent, typically isopropyl alcohol or chlorhexidine. The technique should be as aseptic as possible to prevent biofilm. Reduction of pain at the injection site is achievable through topical or injectable anesthetics, nerve blocks, ice packs, and distraction techniques. The hyaluronic acid filler is injected into the mid to deep dermis, and techniques include serial puncture, linear threading, fanning, and cross-hatching. The technique used depends on the injection site and the specific problem addressed. Lip augmentation requires an injection into the submucosa. Common injection sites are lips, nasolabial folds, glabellar lines, and periorbital and generalized facial wrinkles. Once the injections are complete, the patient should have a cool ice pack applied to minimize bruising and swelling, as well as be advised to avoid manipulating the treatment area.\n\nWhen administered intraarticularly, injection is performed directly into the joint space of the knee. It is recommended to aspirate any joint effusion if present. Strict aseptic technique is necessary during the administration. Injection of lidocaine or another local anesthetic is optional before the intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid. The patient should refrain from vigorous or prolonged weight-bearing physical activity for at least 48 hours post-injection. Several preparations are available, each with differences in the number of injections in each series, molecular weight, origin (avian or bacterial), viscosity, ad presence or absence of cross-linkage.\n\nFor topical use, it is recommended to clean the wound with normal saline and debride the wound if needed before applying hyaluronic acid preparation. A thin layer shall be applied to the ulcer or wound, and excessive rubbing shall be avoided. After application, the wound shall be covered with a sterile non-stick gauze pad or dressing. For use in dermatoses, hyaluronic acid preparation can be applied directly to the affected area.",
    "adverse_effects": "The most common adverse effects associated with hyaluronic acid filler are pain, bruising, redness, itching, and swelling. These side effects are self-limited and typically last no more than seven days. The patient can mitigate them by applying an ice pack to the injection site, remaining upright, and, 1 week before the procedure, stopping medications or supplements that increase the risk of bleeding, for example, aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, vitamin E, fish oils, St. John’s wort, and ginkgo biloba.\n\nExtremely rare side effects of hyaluronic acid gel injection include infection, tissue necrosis, granulomatous foreign body, and activation of herpes labialis. Infection is due to bacterial inoculation through the injection site, which is preventable with proper aseptic technique and ensuring that there is no active infection near the injection site. Tissue necrosis can result from vascular occlusion due to intra-arterial injection of hyaluronic acid filler and highlights the importance of understanding facial anatomy and performing a blood aspiration test before injecting. If this adverse complication is suspected, hyaluronidase should be applied immediately, which will dissolve the hyaluronic acid gel particles. Granulomatous foreign body reaction has been a very rare documented reaction to hyaluronic acid filler injection and is thought to be caused by a reaction to bacterial impurities remaining from the production process. On histology, multinucleated giant cells can be visible at the injection site where the granulomatous foreign body reaction is occurring. The purification process of hyaluronic acid filler has improved significantly, resulting in fewer cases of hypersensitivity reactions. When performing lip injections, it is crucial to be aware of whether the patient has a history of herpes simplex virus infection or has a history of herpes simplex virus reactivation after a previous filler injection. The trauma caused by injection can lead to the reactivation of the virus; this is preventable and treated with oral acyclovir.\n\nAdverse effects of intra-articular injections of hyaluronic acid are usually mild and self-limiting. Local injection site reactions or irritation are the most common side effects. Up to 2% of patients can experience a post-injection flare with more pain, swelling, redness, and warmth, which is usually self-limited and can resolve with icing, rest, and anti-inflammatory medications. Synovial fluid analysis in such cases reveals aseptic fluid with no crystals. Intra-articular infections have not been reported in clinical trials and are extremely rare in clinical practice. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, have been reported. Systemic adverse effects such as rash, arthralgia, myalgia, muscle cramps, and nausea have been reported in about 2% of cases in clinical trials.",
    "toxicity": "The effects of hyaluronic acid filler are reversible with hyaluronidase, an enzyme that breaks down both native and injected hyaluronic acid. Hyaluronidase is particularly useful when the determination is that the filler injection was too superficial, as evidenced by bluish discoloration."
