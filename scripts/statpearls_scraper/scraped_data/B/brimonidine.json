    "clinical_significance": "Despite the increased risk of perioperative bleeding-related complications in patients undergoing MMS during concomitant anticoagulation therapy, the current recommendation is for patients to continue these agents during the perioperative period.\n[5]\nDiscontinuation of clinically indicated anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy is not without risk, and even brief interruptions in therapy may lead to catastrophic thrombotic events, the risk of which generally outweighs the increase in hemorrhagic complications of dermatologic surgery.\n[20]\n[21]\nAdverse effects related to antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy are often minor and easily managed.\n[4]\n[22]\nWhile there is a relative increase in the risk of hemorrhagic complications attributable to antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy, the absolute increase of these complications appears minimal, even for multidrug therapeutic regimens.\n[7]\n\nGiven the current evidence, withholding antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents, including DOACS, before MMS is not routinely recommended.\n[18]\nAspirin taken for analgesia instead of antiplatelet activity may be safely held in the perioperative period. Obtaining an INR for patients on warfarin is neither required nor common practice; if a preoperative INR indicates supratherapeutic treatment, consultation with the prescribing provider or postponing the MMS procedure is warranted.\n[23]"
