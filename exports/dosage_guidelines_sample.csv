( 2.2 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 ) Initiate dosing with a range of 5 to 15 mg every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia.Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient’s response to their initial dose of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution. ( 2.5 , 5.15 ) 2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Ensure accuracy when prescribing, dispensing, and administering Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution to avoid dosing errors due to confusion between mg and mL, and with other oxycodone hydrochloride solutions of different concentrations, which could result in accidental overdose and death. Instruct patients and caregivers on how to accurately measure and take or administer the correct dose of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution. Strongly advise patients and caregivers to always use the enclosed graduated measuring cup when administering Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution 5 mg/5 mL (1 mg/mL) to ensure that the dose is measured and administered accurately. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ]. 2.3 Initial Dosage Although it is not possible to list every condition that is important to the selection of the initial dose of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution, attention must be given to: 1. the daily dose, potency and characteristics of a full agonist or mixed agonist/antagonist the patient has been taking previously 2. risk factors for abuse or addiction, including a prior history of abuse or addiction Use of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution as the First Opioid Analgesic Initiate treatment with Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution: 5 to 15 mg every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient’s response to their initial dose of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution. If a patient has been receiving opioid-containing medications prior to taking Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution, the potency of the prior opioid relative to oxycodone should be factored into the selection of the total daily dose (TDD) of oxycodone. Administration of supplemental analgesia for breakthrough or incident pain and titration of the total daily dose of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution may be necessary, especially in patients who have disease states that are changing rapidly. When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid-dependent patient taking Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the total daily dose of opioid (including Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution) the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. For patients on Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks.",,,,,,Oral

,,,,,6,,"Dosage and Administration Gastric irritation may be reduced if taken before, during, or immediately after meals or with food or milk. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocorticoid activity the least when given at the time of maximal activity (am) for single dose administration. Therefore, it is recommended that prednisone be administered in the morning prior to 9 am and when large doses are given, administration of antacids between meals to help prevent peptic ulcers. The initial dosage of prednisone may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg per day, depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice, while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small increments at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. Multiple Sclerosis In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective. (Dosage range is the same for prednisone and prednisolone.) Alternate Day Therapy Alternate day therapy is a corticosteroid dosing regimen in which twice the usual daily dose of corticoid is administered every other morning. The same clinical findings of hyperadrenocorticism may be noted during long-term pharmacologic dose corticoid therapy administered in conventional daily divided doses. Although it has been shown that there is considerably less adrenal suppression following a single morning dose of prednisolone (10 mg) as opposed to a quarter of that dose administered every 6 hours, there is evidence that some suppressive effect on adrenal activity may be carried over into the following day when pharmacologic doses are used. Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply. Once control has been established, two courses are available: (a) change to alternate day therapy and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or (b) following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. It may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am).",,,,,,Topical

,,,,,,,"DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (Recommended Dosages) summarizes the recommended volumes and concentrations of Lidocaine Hydrochloride Injection, USP for various types of anesthetic procedures. In all cases the lowest concentration and smallest dose that will produce the desired result should be given. Thus, an increase in volume and concentration of Lidocaine Hydrochloride Injection will decrease the onset of anesthesia, prolong the duration of anesthesia, provide a greater degree of muscular relaxation and increase the segmental spread of anesthesia. However, increasing the volume and concentration of Lidocaine Hydrochloride Injection may result in a more profound fall in blood pressure when used in epidural anesthesia. Although the incidence of side effects with lidocaine is quite low, caution should be exercised when employing large volumes and concentrations, since the incidence of side effects is directly proportional to the total dose of local anesthetic agent injected. For intravenous regional anesthesia, only the 50 mL single-dose vial containing 0.5% Lidocaine Hydrochloride Injection, USP should be used. Epidural Anesthesia For epidural anesthesia, only the following available specific products of Lidocaine Hydrochloride Injection by Hospira are recommended: 1%. 30 mL single-dose teartop vials 1.5%. 20 mL single-dose ampuls 2%. 10 mL single-dose ampuls Although these solutions are intended specifically for epidural anesthesia, they may also be used for infiltration and peripheral nerve block provided they are employed as single dose units. In epidural anesthesia, the dosage varies with the number of dermatomes to be anesthetized (generally 2−3 mL of the indicated concentration per dermatome). Caudal and Lumbar Epidural Block: As a precaution against the adverse experiences sometimes observed following unintentional penetration of the subarachnoid space, a test dose such as 2−3 mL of 1.5% lidocaine hydrochloride should be administered at least 5 minutes prior to injecting the total volume required for a lumbar or caudal epidural block. Epinephrine, if contained in the test dose (10−15 mcg have been suggested), may serve as a warning of unintentional intravascular injection. If injected into a blood vessel, this amount of epinephrine is likely to produce a transient ""epinephrine response"" within 45 seconds, consisting of an increase in heart rate and systolic blood pressure, circumoral pallor, palpitations and nervousness in the unsedated patient. The rapid injection of a large volume of Lidocaine Hydrochloride Injection through the catheter should be avoided, and, when feasible, fractional doses should be administered. In the event of the known injection of a large volume of local anesthetic solutions into the subarachnoid space, after suitable resuscitation and if the catheter is in place, consider attempting the recovery of drug by draining a moderate amount of cerebrospinal fluid (such as 10 mL) through the epidural catheter. Adults: For normal healthy adults, the individual maximum recommended dose of lidocaine HCl with epinephrine should not exceed 7 mg/kg (3.5 mg/lb) of body weight and in general it is recommended that the maximum total dose not exceed 500 mg. When used without epinephrine, the maximum individual dose should not exceed 4.5 mg/kg (2 mg/lb) of body weight and in general it is recommended that the maximum total dose does not exceed 300 mg. For continuous epidural or caudal anesthesia, the maximum recommended dosage should not be administered at intervals of less than 90 minutes. When continuous lumbar or caudal epidural anesthesia is used for non-obstetrical procedures, more drug may be administered if required to produce adequate anesthesia. The maximum recommended dose per 90 minute period of lidocaine hydrochloride for paracervical block in obstetrical patients and non-obstetrical patients is 200 mg total. One-half of the total dose is usually administered to each side. Inject slowly five minutes between sides. For intravenous regional anesthesia, the dose administered should not exceed 4 mg/kg in adults. Children: It is difficult to recommend a maximum dose of any drug for children, since this varies as a function of age and weight. For children over 3 years of age who have a normal lean body mass and normal body development, the maximum dose is determined by the child’s age and weight. For example, in a child of 5 years weighing 50 lbs., the dose of lidocaine HCl should not exceed 75 — 100 mg (1.5 — 2 mg/lb). The use of even more dilute solutions (i.e., 0.25 — 0.5%) and total dosages not to exceed 3 mg/kg (1.4 mg/lb) are recommended for induction of intravenous regional anesthesia in children. In some cases it will be necessary to dilute available concentrations with 0.9% sodium chloride injection in order to obtain the required final concentration.

Most experience to date is with single doses of MARCAINE up to 225 mg with epinephrine 1:200,000 and 175 mg without epinephrine; more or less drug may be used depending on individualization of each case. In clinical studies to date, total daily doses have been up to 400 mg. Use in Epidural Anesthesia: During epidural administration of MARCAINE, 0.5% and 0.75% solutions should be administered in incremental doses of 3 mL to 5 mL with sufficient time between doses to detect toxic manifestations of unintentional intravascular or intrathecal injection. In obstetrics, only the 0.5% and 0.25% concentrations should be used; incremental doses of 3 mL to 5 mL of the 0.5% solution not exceeding 50 mg to 100 mg at any dosing interval are recommended. Test Dose for Caudal and Lumbar Epidural Blocks: The Test Dose of MARCAINE (0.5% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine in a 3 mL ampul) is recommended for use as a test dose when clinical conditions permit prior to caudal and lumbar epidural blocks. This may serve as a warning of unintended intravascular or subarachnoid injection. (See PRECAUTIONS .) The pulse rate and other signs should be monitored carefully immediately following each test dose administration to detect possible intravascular injection, and adequate time for onset of spinal block should be allotted to detect possible intrathecal injection. An intravascular or subarachnoid injection is still possible even if results of the test dose are negative. (See WARNINGS and OVERDOSAGE .) Use in Dentistry: The 0.5% concentration with epinephrine is recommended for infiltration and block injection in the maxillary and mandibular area when a longer duration of local anesthetic action is desired, such as for oral surgical procedures generally associated with significant postoperative pain. The average dose of 1.8 mL (9 mg) per injection site will usually suffice; an occasional second dose of 1.8 mL (9 mg) may be used if necessary to produce adequate anesthesia after making allowance for 2 to 10 minutes onset time.",,,,,,Oral

Patients with Normal Renal Function Adults The recommended dosage of gentamicin injection for patients with serious infections and normal renal function is 3 mg/kg/day, administered in three equal doses every eight hours (). For patients with life-threatening infections, dosages up to 5 mg/kg/day may be administered in three or four equal doses. This dosage should be reduced to 3 mg/kg/day as soon as clinically indicated (). For example, the peak concentration (at 30 to 60 minutes after IM injection) is expected to be in the range of 4 to 6 mcg/mL. When monitoring peak concentrations after IM or IV administration, dosage should be adjusted so that prolonged levels above 12 mcg/mL are avoided. When monitoring trough concentrations (just prior to the next dose), dosage should be adjusted so that levels above 2 mcg/mL are avoided. Determination of the adequacy of a serum level for a particular patient must take into consideration the susceptibility of the causative organism, the severity of the infection and the status of the patient’s host-defense mechanisms.

Pregabalin extended-release tablets should be swallowed whole and should not be split, crushed or chewed. Instruct patients that if they miss taking their dose of pregabalin extended-release tablets after an evening meal, then they should take their usual dose of pregabalin extended-release tablets prior to bedtime following a snack. If they miss taking the dose of pregabalin extended-release tablets prior to bedtime, then they should take their usual dose of pregabalin extended-release tablets following a morning meal. If they miss taking the dose of pregabalin extended-release tablets following the morning meal, then they should take their usual dose of pregabalin extended-release tablets at the usual time that evening following an evening meal [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]. 2.2 Neuropathic Pain Associated with Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy Begin dosing at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. The maximum recommended dose of pregabalin extended-release tablets is 330 mg once daily. Although pregabalin was studied at 600 mg/day, there was no evidence that this dose conferred additional significant benefit and this dose was less well tolerated. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions with pregabalin, treatment with doses above 330 mg/day is not recommended for pregabalin extended-release tablets. 2.3 Postherpetic Neuralgia Begin dosing at 165 mg once daily and increase to 330 mg once daily within 1 week based on individual patient response and tolerability. Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 weeks to 4 weeks of treatment with 330 mg once daily and who are able to tolerate pregabalin extended-release tablets, may be treated with up to 660 mg once daily. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, dosing above 330 mg/day should be reserved only for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 330 mg daily. The maximum recommended dose of pregabalin extended-release tablets is 660 mg once daily. 2.4 Conversion from Pregabalin Capsules or Oral Solution to Pregabalin Extended-Release Tablets When switching from pregabalin to pregabalin e xtended-release tablets on the day of the switch, instruct patients to take their morning dose of pregabalin as prescribed and initiate pregabalin extended-release tablets therapy after an evening meal. 247.5 mg = 3 × 82.5 mg tablets taken once a day. 495 mg = 3 × 165 mg tablets taken once a day. 660 mg = 2 × 330 mg tablets taken once a day.

CLcr in mL/min may be estimated from serum creatinine (mg/dL) determination using the Cockcroft and Gault equation: Next, refer to the Dosage and Administration section to determine the recommended total daily dose based on indication, for a patient with normal renal function (CLcr greater than or equal to 60 mL/min). (For example: A patient initiating pregabalin extended-release tablets therapy for postherpetic neuralgia with normal renal function [CLcr greater than or equal to 60 mL/min], receives a single daily dose of 165 mg/day pregabalin. Therefore, a renal impaired patient with a CLcr of 50 mL/min would receive a single daily dose of 82.5 mg.)

If an optimal response is not achieved, the dosage should be increased to atenolol 100 mg given as one tablet a day. Increasing the dosage beyond 100 mg a day is unlikely to produce any further benefit.Atenolol may be used alone or concomitantly with other antihypertensive agents including thiazide-type diuretics, hydralazine, prazosin, and alpha-methyldopa. Angina Pectoris The initial dose of atenolol is 50 mg given as one tablet a day. If an optimal response is not achieved within one week, the dosage should be increased to atenolol 100 mg given as one tablet a day. Some patients may require a dosage of 200 mg once a day for optimal effect.Twenty-four hour control with once daily dosing is achieved by giving doses larger than necessary to achieve an immediate maximum effect. The maximum early effect on exercise tolerance occurs with doses of 50 to 100 mg, but at these doses the effect at 24 hours is attenuated, averaging about 50% to 75% of that observed with once a day oral doses of 200 mg. Acute Myocardial Infarction In patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction, treatment with atenolol injection should be initiated as soon as possible after the patient’s arrival in the hospital and after eligibility is established. Treatment should begin with the intravenous administration of 5 mg atenolol over 5 minutes followed by another 5 mg intravenous injection 10 minutes later. Atenolol injection should be administered under carefully controlled conditions including monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiogram. Dilutions of atenolol injection in Dextrose Injection USP, Sodium Chloride Injection USP, or Sodium Chloride and Dextrose Injection may be used. These admixtures are stable for 48 hours if they are not used immediately.In patients who tolerate the full intravenous dose (10 mg), atenolol tablets 50 mg should be initiated 10 minutes after the last intravenous dose followed by another 50 mg oral dose 12 hours later. Thereafter, atenolol can be given orally either 100 mg once daily or 50 mg twice a day for a further 6 to 9 days or until discharge from the hospital. ()Data from other beta blocker trials suggest that if there is any question concerning the use of IV beta blocker or clinical estimate that there is a contraindication, the IV beta blocker may be eliminated and patients fulfilling the safety criteria may be given atenolol tablets 50 mg twice daily or 100 mg once a day for at least seven days (if the IV dosing is excluded).Although the demonstration of efficacy of atenolol is based entirely on data from the first seven postinfarction days, data from other beta blocker trials suggest that treatment with beta blockers that are effective in the postinfarction setting may be continued for one to three years if there are no contraindications.Atenolol is an additional treatment to standard coronary care unit therapy. Atenolol excretion would be expected to decrease with advancing age.No significant accumulation of atenolol occurs until creatinine clearance falls below 35 mL/min/1.73 m2. Accumulation of atenolol and prolongation of its half-life were studied in subjects with creatinine clearance between 5 and 105 mL/min.

In all cases the lowest concentration and smallest dose that will produce the desired result should be given. Thus, an increase in volume and concentration of Xylocaine Injection will decrease the onset of anesthesia, prolong the duration of anesthesia, provide a greater degree of muscular relaxation and increase the segmental spread of anesthesia. However, increasing the volume and concentration of Xylocaine Injection may result in a more profound fall in blood pressure when used in epidural anesthesia. Although the incidence of side effects with lidocaine HCl is quite low, caution should be exercised when employing large volumes and concentrations, since the incidence of side effects is directly proportional to the total dose of local anesthetic agent injected. For intravenous regional anesthesia, only the 50 mL single dose vial containing Xylocaine (lidocaine HCl) 0.5% Injection should be used. Epidural Anesthesia For epidural anesthesia, only the following dosage forms Xylocaine Injection are recommended: 1% without epinephrine 10 mL Plastic Ampule 1% without epinephrine 30 mL single dose solutions 1% with epinephrine 1:200,000 30 mL single dose solutions 1.5% without epinephrine 10 mL Plastic Ampule 1.5% without epinephrine 20 mL Plastic Ampule 1.5% with epinephrine 1:200,000 30 mL ampules, 30 mL single dose solutions 2% without epinephrine 10 mL Plastic Ampule 2% with epinephrine 1:200,000 20 mL ampules, 20 mL single dose solutions Although these solutions are intended specifically for epidural anesthesia, they may also be used for infiltration and peripheral nerve block, provided they are employed as single dose units. In epidural anesthesia, the dosage varies with the number of dermatomes to be anesthetized (generally 2 to 3 mL of the indicated concentration per dermatome). Caudal and Lumbar Epidural Block As a precaution against the adverse experience sometimes observed following unintentional penetration of the subarachnoid space, a test dose such as 2 to 3 mL of 1.5% lidocaine HCl should be administered at least 5 minutes prior to injecting the total volume required for a lumbar or caudal epidural block. Epinephrine, if contained in the test dose (10 to 15 mcg have been suggested), may serve as a warning of unintentional intravascular injection. If injected into a blood vessel, this amount of epinephrine is likely to produce a transient “epinephrine response” within 45 seconds, consisting of an increase in heart rate and systolic blood pressure, circumoral pallor, palpitations and nervousness in the unsedated patient. The rapid injection of a large volume of Xylocaine Injection through the catheter should be avoided, and, when feasible, fractional doses should be administered. In the event of the known injection of a large volume of local anesthetic solution into the subarachnoid space, after suitable resuscitation and if the catheter is in place, consider attempting the recovery of drug by draining a moderate amount of cerebrospinal fluid (such as 10 mL) through the epidur.",,DailyMed,True,,,Intravenous

Do not administer active Vitamin D analogs during CRYSVITA treatment [see Contraindications (4) ]. 2.8 General Considerations for Subcutaneous Administration Injection sites should be rotated with each injection administered at a different anatomic location (upper arms, upper thighs, buttocks, or any quadrant of abdomen) than the previous injection. Do not inject into moles, scars, or areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, hard, or not intact. If a given dose on a dosing day requires multiple vials of CRYSVITA, contents from two vials can be combined for injection. The maximum volume of CRYSVITA per injection is 1.5 mL. If multiple injections are required on a given dosing day, administer at different injection sites.

,,,,150 mg,,,"Store Succinylcholine Chloride Injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product. Adults For Short Surgical Procedures The average dose required to produce neuromuscular blockade and to facilitate tracheal intubation is 0.6 mg/kg Succinylcholine Chloride Injection given intravenously. The optimum dose will vary among individuals and may be from 0.3 to 1.1 mg/kg for adults. Following administration of doses in this range, neuromuscular blockade develops in about 1 minute; maximum blockade may persist for about 2 minutes, after which recovery takes place within 4 to 6 minutes. A 5 to 10 mg test dose may be used to determine the sensitivity of the patient and the individual recovery time (see PRECAUTIONS ). For Long Surgical Procedures The dose of succinylcholine administered by infusion depends upon the duration of the surgical procedure and the need for muscle relaxation. The average rate for an adult ranges between 2.5 and 4.3 mg per minute. Solutions containing from 1 to 2 mg per mL succinylcholine have commonly been used for continuous infusion. The more dilute solution (1 mg per mL) is probably preferable from the standpoint of ease of control of the rate of administration of the drug and, hence, of relaxation. This intravenous solution containing 1 mg per mL may be administered at a rate of 0.5 mg (0.5 mL) to 10 mg (10 mL) per minute to obtain the required amount of relaxation. Intermittent intravenous injections of succinylcholine may also be used to provide muscle relaxation for long procedures. An intravenous injection of 0.3 to 1.1 mg/kg may be given initially, followed, at appropriate intervals, by further injections of 0.04 to 0.07 mg/kg to maintain the degree of relaxation required. Pediatrics For emergency tracheal intubation or in instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, the intravenous dose of succinylcholine is 2 mg/kg for infants and small pediatric patients; for older pediatric patients and adolescents the dose is 1 mg/kg (see BOX WARNING and PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use ). For example, the usual adult IV dose of 0.6 mg/kg is comparable to a dose of 2-3 mg/kg in neonates and infants to 6 months and 1-2 mg/kg in infants up to 2 years of age. Whereas bradycardia is common in pediatric patients after an initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg, bradycardia is seen in adults only after repeated exposure. Intramuscular Use If necessary, succinylcholine may be given intramuscularly to infants, older pediatric patients or adults when a suitable vein is inaccessible. A dose of up to 3 to 4 mg/kg may be given, but not more than 150 mg total dose should be administered by this route. The onset of effect of succinylcholine given intramuscularly is usually observed in about 2 to 3 minutes. Admixtures containing 1 to 2 mg/mL may be prepared by adding 1 g Succinylcholine Chloride to 1,000 or 500 mL sterile solution, such as 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.",,,,,,Intravenous

Moderate Hypercalcemia The recommended dose of pamidronate disodium in moderate hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium* of approximately 12 to 13.5 mg/dL) is 60 to 90 mg given as a SINGLE-DOSE, intravenous infusion over 2 to 24 hours. Severe Hypercalcemia The recommended dose of pamidronate disodium in severe hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium* >13.5 mg/dL) is 90 mg given as a SINGLE-DOSE, intravenous infusion over 2 to 24 hours. It is recommended that a minimum of 7 days elapse before retreatment, to allow for full response to the initial dose. Paget’s Disease The recommended dose of pamidronate disodium in patients with moderate to severe Paget’s disease of bone is 30 mg daily, administered as a 4 hour infusionon 3 consecutive days for a total dose of 90 mg. Osteolytic Bone Lesions of Multiple Myeloma The recommended dose of pamidronate disodium in patients with osteolytic bone lesions of multiple myeloma is 90 mg administered as a 4 hour infusion given on a monthly basis. Limited information is available on the use of pamidronate disodium in multiple myeloma patients with a serum creatinine ≥3 mg/dL. In a clinical study, renal deterioration was defined as follows: • For patients with normal baseline creatinine, increase of 0.5 mg/dL. • For patients with abnormal baseline creatinine, increase of 1.0 mg/dL. Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Breast Cancer The recommended dose of pamidronate disodium in patients with osteolytic bone metastases is 90 mg administered over a 2 hour infusion given every 3 to 4 weeks. It has been given less frequently with etoposide, cisplatin, cytarabine, paclitaxel, and aminoglutethimide. In a clinical study, renal deterioration was defined as follows: • For patients with normal baseline creatinine, increase of 0.5 mg/dL. • For patients with abnormal baseline creatinine, increase of 1.0 mg/dL. Calcium and Vitamin D Supplementation In the absence of hypercalcemia, patients with predominantly lytic bone metastases or multiple myeloma, who are at risk of calcium or vitamin D deficiency, and patients with Paget’s disease of the bone, should be given oral calcium and vitamin D supplementation in order to minimize the risk of hypocalcemia. Preparation of Solution Reconstitution Pamidronate disodium for injection is reconstituted by adding 10 mL of sterile water for injection, to each vial, resulting in a solution of 30 mg/10 mL or 90 mg/10 mL. Method of Administration DUE TO THE RISK OF CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN RENAL FUNCTION, WHICH MAY PROGRESS TO RENAL FAILURE, SINGLE DOSES OFPAMIDRONATE DISODIUM SHOULD NOT EXCEED 90 MG. Hypercalcemia of Malignancy The daily dose must be administered as an intravenous infusion over at least 2 to 24 hours for the 60 mg and 90 mg doses. The recommended dose should be diluted in 1000 mL of sterile 0.45% or 0.9% sodium chloride injection, or 5% dextrose injection. Paget’s Disease The recommended daily dose of 30 mg should be diluted in 500 mL of sterile 0.45% or 0.9% sodium chloride injection, or 5% dextrose injection, and administered over a 4 hour period for 3 consecutive days. Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Breast Cancer The recommended dose of 90 mg should be diluted in 250 mL of sterile 0.45% or 0.9% sodium chloride injection, or 5% dextrose injection, and administered over a 2 hour period every 3 to 4 weeks.

In the treatment of beriberi, 10 to 20 mg of thiamine hydrochloride are given IM three times daily for as long as two weeks. (See WARNINGS regarding repeated injections of thiamine.) An oral therapeutic multivitamin preparation containing 5 to 10 mg thiamine, administered daily for one month, is recommended to achieve body tissue saturation. Infantile beriberi that is mild may respond to oral therapy, but if collapse occurs, doses of 25 mg may cautiously be given IV. Patients with neuritis of pregnancy in whom vomiting is severe enough to preclude adequate oral therapy should receive 5 to 10 mg of thiamine hydrochloride IM daily. In the treatment of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, thiamine hydrochloride has been administered IV in an initial dose of 100 mg, followed by IM doses of 50 to 100 mg daily until the patient is consuming a regular, balanced diet. (See WARNINGS regarding repeated injections of thiamine.) Patients with marginal thiamine status to whom dextrose is being administered should receive 100 mg thiamine hydrochloride in each of the first few liters of IV fluid to avoid precipitating heart failure.",,,,,,Oral

The dosage employed in the treatment of chronic simple (open-angle) glaucoma ranges from 250 mg to 1 g of acetaZOLAMIDE per 24 hours, usually in divided doses for amounts over 250 mg. It has usually been found that a dosage in excess of 1 g per 24 hours does not produce an increased effect. In treatment of secondary glaucoma and in the preoperative treatment of some cases of acute congestive (closed-angle) glaucoma, the preferred dosage is 250 mg every four hours, although some cases have responded to 250 mg twice daily on short-term therapy. In some acute cases, it may be more satisfactory to administer an initial dose of 500 mg followed by 125 mg or 250 mg every four hours depending on the individual case. The suggested total daily dose is 8 to 30 mg per kg in divided doses. Although some patients respond to a low dose, the optimum range appears to be from 375 to 1000 mg daily. However, some investigators feel that daily doses in excess of 1 g do not produce any better results than a 1 g dose. When acetaZOLAMIDE is given in combination with other anticonvulsants, it is suggested that the starting dose should be 250 mg once daily in addition to the existing medications. Congestive Heart Failure For diuresis in congestive heart failure, the starting dose is usually 250 to 375 mg once daily in the morning (5 mg/kg). AcetaZOLAMIDE yields best diuretic results when given on alternate days, or for two days alternating with a day of rest. Drug-Induced Edema Recommended dosage is 250 to 375 mg of acetaZOLAMIDE once a day for one or two days, alternating with a day of rest. Acute Mountain Sickness Dosage is 500 mg to 1000 mg daily, in divided doses using tablets or sustained-release capsules as appropriate. In circumstances of rapid ascent, such as in rescue or military operations, the higher dose level of 1000 mg is recommended.",,DailyMed,True,,,Intravenous

Zonisamide capsules should be administered once or twice daily, using 25 mg, 50 mg or 100 mg capsules. Zonisamide capsules are given orally and can be taken with or without food. Capsules should be swallowed whole. Although the regimen described below is one that has been shown to be tolerated, the prescriber may wish to prolong the duration of treatment at the lower doses in order to fully assess the effects of zonisamide at steady state, noting that many of the side effects of zonisamide are more frequent at doses of 300 mg per day and above. Although there is some evidence of greater response at doses above 100-200 mg/day, the increase appears small and formal dose-response studies have not been conducted. The initial dose of zonisamide capsules should be 100 mg daily. After two weeks, the dose may be increased to 200 mg/day for at least two weeks. It can be increased to 300 mg/day and 400 mg/day, with the dose stable for at least two weeks to achieve steady state at each level. Evidence from controlled trials suggests that zonisamide capsules doses of 100-600 mg/day are effective, but there is no suggestion of increasing response above 400 mg/day (see.",,DailyMed,False,,,
