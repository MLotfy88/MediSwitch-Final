    "toxicity": "Management of SNCD often involves both pharmacological and surgical interventions, each of which carries the potential for adverse effects. Proactive identification and management of these toxicities is crucial to optimizing patient outcomes and avoiding iatrogenic complications.\n\nPharmacologic Toxicities\n\nTopical corticosteroids:\n\nPotential toxicities:\nElevated IOP → steroid-induced glaucoma\nCataract formation (posterior subcapsular)\nDelayed corneal epithelial healing\n\nManagement:\nLimit duration and frequency\nUse low-potency agents (eg, loteprednol)\nRegular IOP monitoring in long-term users\nTaper gradually under supervision\n[96]\n\nTopical cyclosporine A and Lifitegrast:\n\nPotential toxicities:\nLocal irritation, burning, redness, and stinging on instillation\nTransient blurred vision\n\nManagement:\nAdminister artificial tears to reduce discomfort\nEducate patients about the delayed onset of effect (6-8 weeks)\nMonitor compliance and reinforce proper technique\n[97]\n\nOral doxycycline:\n\nPotential toxicities:\nGastrointestinal upset\nPhotosensitivity\nEsophageal irritation\n\nManagement:\nPrescribe with food (but not dairy)\nAdvise sun protection\nRecommend taking with a full glass of water and an upright posture\n[98]\n\nMitomycin-C:\n\nPotential toxicities:\nCorneal endothelial cell toxicity\nDelayed epithelial healing\nScleral thinning (rare)\n\nManagement:\nApply intraoperatively in a controlled, timed manner (eg, 0.02% for 10-30 seconds)\nRinse thoroughly with balanced salt solution\nAvoid in thin corneas or limbal stem cell deficiency\nUse judiciously with an ophthalmic surgeon's expertise\n[99]\n\nSurgical Complications and Toxicities\n\nSuperficial keratectomy:\n\nRisks:\nCorneal haze or scarring\nRecurrence of nodules\nDelayed epithelial healing\n\nManagement:\nEnsure proper dissection plane\nPostoperative use of topical steroids and lubricants\nDiamond burr polishing or PTK for residual surface irregularity\n[100]\n\nPhototherapeutic keratectomy:\n\nRisks:\nHyperopic shift or unexpected refractive changes\nStromal haze\nDelayed epithelialization\n\nManagement:\nPredict refractive shifts (typically myopic in SNCD)\nUse lower ablation depths\nApply topical steroids and lubricants postoperatively\nConsider bandage contact lenses for comfort\n[101]\n\nLamellar or penetrating keratoplasty:\n\nRisks:\nGraft rejection\nInfection\nAstigmatism\n\nManagement:\nRoutine follow-up and graft monitoring\nUse of topical immunosuppressants and antibiotics\nSpectacle or contact lens correction for postoperative refractive errors\n[102]\n\nContact Lens–Related Adverse Effects\n\nIn patients with long-term contact lens wear contributing to or complicating SNCD:\n\nRisks:\nHypoxia-induced corneal changes\nInfection (eg, microbial keratitis)\nMechanical trauma\n\nManagement:\nTemporary discontinuation\nRefitting with high Dk lenses\nDaily disposable lenses to reduce protein buildup\n[103]\n\nDelayed or Missed Diagnosis\n\nAdverse outcome:\nUnnecessary visual impairment\nMisdiagnosis as dystrophies, keratitis, or degenerations (eg, band keratopathy)\n\nManagement:\nHigh index of suspicion in patients with chronic ocular surface inflammation and subepithelial opacities\nAS-OCT for accurate diagnosis\nHistopathological examination in atypical cases\n\nAlthough SNCD is typically a benign and indolent disease, both medical and surgical interventions carry a risk of toxicity and adverse effects. A tailored, cautious, and evidence-based approach—along with patient education and regular monitoring—can mitigate complications and improve long-term outcomes. The integration of imaging tools, such as AS-OCT, and surgical aids, such as intraoperative optical coherence tomography, can further reduce procedural risks.\n[72]"
