The enzyme AChE hydrolyses the released ACh, inactivates it and thus inhibits the gastric motility leading to various digestive disorders. Besides ACh, dopamine is present in significant amounts in the gastrointestinal tract and has several inhibitory effects on gastrointestinal motility, including reduction of lower esophageal sphincter and intragastric pressure. These effects appear to result from suppression of ACh release from the myenteric motor neurons and are mediated by the D2 subtype of dopamine receptors. Itopride, by virtue of its dopamine D2 receptor antagonism, removes the inhibitory effects on Ach release. It also inhibits the enzyme AchE which prevents the degradation of ACh. The net effect is an increase in ACh concentration, which in turn, promotes gastric motility, increases the lower esophageal sphincter pressure, accelerates gastric emptying and improves gastro-duodenal coordination. This dual mode of action of Itopride is unique and different from the actions of other prokinetic agents available in the market.

By doing so, it inhibits acid secretion into the gsatric lumen. This effect is dose-related and leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus.



Esomeprazole is the s-isomer of [DB00338], which is a racemate of the S- and R-enantiomer. Esomeprazole has been shown to inhibit acid secretion to a similar extent as [DB00338], without any significant differences between the two compounds _in vitro_. 



PPIs such as esomeprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]



Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as esomeprazole has been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Baloxavir marboxil is associated with a risk for loss of efficacy due to changes in influenza virus such as changes in virus subtypes, emergence of virus resistance, and changes in viral virulence; therefore, the drug should be used after considering available information on drug susceptibility patterns for circulating influenza virus strains.[L42855]', 'The influenza virus RNA polymerase complex is a heterotrimer made up of three protein subunits - polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1), polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2), and polymerase acidic protein (PA).[A39894] This polymerase complex is an influenza virus-specific enzyme essential for viral gene transcription and replication,[L42855] with its subunits playing different roles in viral mRNA synthesis.

Alternative splicing allows the formation of channels composed of varying subunit isoforms expressed at different concentrations in different tissues.[A177730] In pancreatic beta cells, ATP-sensitive potassium channels play a role as essential metabolic sensors and regulators that couple membrane excitability with glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS).[A177727] When there is a decrease in the ATP:ADP ratio, the channels are activated and open, leading to K+ efflux from the cell, membrane hyperpolarization, and suppression of insulin secretion.[A177727] In contrast, increased uptake of glucose into the cell leads to elevated intracellular ATP:ADP ratio, leading to the closure of channels and membrane depolarization. Depolarization leads to activation and opening of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and consequently an influx of calcium ions into the cell.[A177727] Elevated intracellular calcium levels causes the contraction of the filaments of actomyosin responsible for the exocytosis of insulin granules stored in vesicles.[A177715] Glimepiride blocks the ATP-sensitive potassium channel by binding non-specifically to the B sites of both sulfonylurea receptor-1 (SUR1) and sulfonylurea receptor-2A (SUR2A) subunits as well as the A site of SUR1 subunit of the channel to promote insulin secretion from the beta cell.[A177715] ', 'Glimepiride stimulates the secretion of insulin granules from the pancreatic beta cells and improves the sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin to increase peripheral glucose uptake, thus reducing plasma blood glucose levels and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels.

This combination is also indicated to treat hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP) in patients aged 18 years and older.[L45128]



In all cases, to mitigate the risk of bacterial resistance and preserve clinical efficacy, ceftazidime should only be used for infections that are confirmed or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacterial strains.[L32935, L45128]', 'The bacterial cell wall, which is located at the periphery of Gram-positive bacteria and within the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria, comprises a glycopeptide polymer synthesized through cross-linking of glycans to peptide stems on alternating saccharides, which is known commonly as peptidoglycan.[A232920] Cell wall formation, recycling, and remodelling require numerous enzymes, including a family of enzymes with similar active site character despite distinct and sometimes overlapping roles as carboxypeptidases, endopeptidases, transpeptidases, and transglycosylases, known as "penicillin-binding proteins" (PBPs). The number of PBPs differs between bacteria, in which some are considered essential and others redundant. In general, inhibition of one or more essential PBPs results in impaired cell wall homeostasis, loss of cell integrity, and is ultimately bactericidal.[A232920, A232925, A232930]



Ceftazidime is a semisynthetic third-generation cephalosporin with broad activity against numerous Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria.[L32935] Like other β-lactam antibiotics, ceftazidime exhibits its bactericidal effect primarily through direct inhibition of specific PBPs in susceptible bacteria.[A232935] _In vitro_ experiments in Gram-negative bacteria such as _Escherichia coli_, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, _Acinetobacter baumannii_, and _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ suggest that ceftazidime primarily binds to PBP3, with weaker binding to PBP1a/1b and PBP2 as well; although binding to other PBPs, such as PBP4, is detectable, the concentrations required are much greater than those achieved clinically.[A232935, A16721, A232940, A232945, A232950] Similarly, ceftazidime showed binding to _Staphylococcus aureus_ PBP 1, 2, and 3 with a much lower affinity for PBP4.[A16721] Recent data for _Mycobacterium abcessus_ suggest that ceftazidime can inhibit PonA1, PonA2, and PbpA at intermediate concentrations.[A232930]', 'Ceftazidime is a semisynthetic, broad-spectrum, third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic that is bactericidal through inhibition of enzymes responsible for cell-wall synthesis, primarily penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP3).[L32935] Among cephalosporins, ceftazidime is notable for its resistance to numerous β-lactamases and its broad spectrum of activity against Gram-negative bacteria, including _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_.[A232935] However, it is less active than first- and second-generation cephalosporins against _Staphylococcus aureus_ and other Gram-positive bacteria and also has low activity against anaerobes.[A232935, A233160] Ceftazidime has confirmed activity against clinically relevant Gram-negative bacteria including _Citrobacter_ spp., _Enterobacter_ spp., _Klebsiella_ spp., _Proteus_ spp., _Serratia spp., _Escherichia coli_, _Haemophilus influenzae_, _Neisseria meningitidis_, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, and some Gram-positive bacteria including _Staphylococcus_ spp. and _Streptococcus_ spp. There are also _in vitro_ data for ceftazidime efficacy against a wide variety of other bacteria, such as _Acinetobacter baumannii_ and _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_, but no clear clinical studies to support the use of ceftazidime for infections caused by these bacteria.[L32935]



Although β-lactam antibiotics like ceftazidime are generally well tolerated, there remains a risk of serious acute hypersensitivity reactions, which is higher in patients with a known allergy to ceftazidime or any other β-lactam antibiotic. As with all antibiotics, ceftazidime may result in the overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms and potentially serious effects including _Clostridium difficile_-associated diarrhea (CDAD); CDAD should be considered in patients who develop diarrhea and, in confirmed cases, supportive care initiated immediately. Ceftazidime is primarily renally excreted such that high and prolonged serum concentrations can occur in patients with renal insufficiency, leading to seizures, nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), encephalopathy, coma, asterixis, neuromuscular excitability, and myoclonia. Treatment may lead to the development or induction of resistance with a risk of treatment failure. Periodic susceptibility testing should be considered, and monotherapy failure may necessitate the addition of another antibiotic such as an aminoglycoside.

Simvastatin is also indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality including myocardial infarction, stroke, and the need for revascularization procedures. It is primarily used in patients at high risk of coronary events because of existing coronary heart disease, diabetes, peripheral vessel disease, history of stroke or other cerebrovascular disease.[F4655, F4658]



Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]', 'Simvastatin is a prodrug in which the 6-membered lactone ring of simvastatin is hydrolyzed <i>in vivo</i> to generate the beta,delta-dihydroxy acid, an active metabolite structurally similar to HMG-CoA (hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA). Once hydrolyzed, simvastatin competes with HMG-CoA for HMG-CoA reductase, a hepatic microsomal enzyme, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A181421] Simvastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which increases hepatic uptake of LDL. Simvastatin also inhibits hepatic synthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL).[F4655, F4658] The overall effect is a decrease in plasma LDL and VLDL. 



At therapeutic doses, the HMG-CoA enzyme is not completely blocked by simvastatin activity, thereby allowing biologically necessary amounts of mevalonate to remain available. As mevalonate is an early step in the biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol, therapy with simvastatin would also not be expected to cause any accumulation of potentially toxic sterols. In addition, HMG-CoA is metabolized readily back to acetyl-CoA, which participates in many biosynthetic processes in the body.[F4658]



In vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that simvastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] This includes improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response.



Statins have also been found to bind allosterically to β2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and in T cell activation.[A181559]', 'Simvastatin is an oral antilipemic agent which inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. It is used to lower total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and trigleride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, rosuvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A181087, A181406]



Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]



**Skeletal Muscle Effects**



Simvastatin occasionally causes myopathy manifested as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness with creatine kinase (CK) above ten times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Myopathy sometimes takes the form of rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria, and rare fatalities have occurred. Predisposing factors for myopathy include advanced age (≥65 years), female gender, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. Chinese patients may also be at increased risk for myopathy. In most cases, muscle symptoms and CK increases resolved when treatment was promptly discontinued.[F4655, F4658]



In a clinical trial database of 41,413 patients, the incidence of myopathy was approximately 0.03% and 0.08% at 20 and 40 mg/day, respectively, while the risk of myopathy with simvastatin 80 mg (0.61%) was disproportionately higher than that observed at the lower doses. It''s therefore recommended that the 80mg dose of simvastatin should be used only in patients who have been taking simvastatin 80 mg chronically (e.g., for 12 months or more) without evidence of muscle toxicity. As well, patients already stabilized on simvastatin 80mg should be monitored closely for evidence of muscle toxicity; if they need to be initiated on an interacting drug that is contraindicated or is associated with a dose cap for simvastatin, that patient should be switched to an alternative statin with less potential for the drug-drug interaction.[F4655, F4658]



The risk of myopathy during treatment with simvastatin may be increased with concurrent administration of interacting drugs such as [fenofibrate], [niacin], [gemfibrozil], [cyclosporine], and strong inhibitors of the CYP3A4 enzyme.  Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors coadministered with [colchicine], and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together.[F4655, F4658]



**Liver Enzyme Abnormalities**



Persistent increases (to more than 3X the ULN) in serum transaminases have occurred in approximately 1% of patients who received simvastatin in clinical studies. When drug treatment was interrupted or discontinued in these patients, the transaminase levels usually fell slowly to pretreatment levels. The increases were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. [F4655, F4658]



In the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S),[A181538] the number of patients with more than one transaminase elevation to >3 times the ULN, over the course of the study, was not significantly different between the simvastatin and placebo groups (14 [0.7%] vs. 12 [0.6%]). The frequency of single elevations of ALT to 3 times the ULN was significantly higher in the simvastatin group in the first year of the study (20 vs. 8, p=0.023), but not thereafter. In the HPS (Heart Protection Study),[A181475] in which 20,536 patients were randomized to receive simvastatin 40 mg/day or placebo, the incidences of elevated transaminases (>3X ULN confirmed by repeat test) were 0.21% (n=21) for patients treated with simvastatin and 0.09% (n=9) for patients treated with placebo.[F4655, F4658] 



**Endocrine Effects**



Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including simvastatin.[F4655]



Although cholesterol is the precursor of all steroid hormones, studies with simvastatin have suggested that this agent has no clinical effect on steroidogenesis. Simvastatin caused no increase in biliary lithogenicity and, therefore, would not be expected to increase the incidence of gallstones.[F4658]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

The sympathetic outflow is regulated by alpha (α)-2 adrenergic receptors and imidazoline receptors expressed on adrenergic neurons within the rostral ventrolateral medulla.[A1501] Methyldopa is metabolized to α‐methylnorepinephrine via dopamine beta-hydroxylase activity and, consequently, alpha-methylepinephrine via phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase activity.[A232244, A232249, A232259] Mediating the therapeutic effects of methyldopa, α‐methylnorepinephrine and α-methylepinephrine active metabolites are agonists at presynaptic alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the brainstem. Stimulating alpha-2 adrenergic receptors results in the inhibition of adrenergic neuronal outflow and attenuation of norepinephrine release in the brainstem. Consequently, the output of vasoconstrictor adrenergic signals to the peripheral sympathetic nervous system is reduced, leading to a reduction in blood pressure.[A1499]



The L-isomer of alpha-methyldopa also reduces blood pressure by inhibiting aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, also known as DOPA decarboxylase, which is an enzyme responsible for the syntheses of dopamine and serotonin.[L32614] Inhibiting this enzyme leads to depletion of biogenic amines such as norepinephrine. However, inhibition of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase plays a minimal role in the blood-pressure‐lowering effect of methyldopa.[A1501, A1505]', 'Antihypertensive effects of methyldopa are mostly mediated by its pharmacologically active metabolite, alpha-methylnorepinephrine, which works as an agonist at central inhibitory alpha-adrenergic receptors.[L32614] Stimulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors leads to decreased peripheral sympathetic tone and reduced arterial pressure.[A1505] Methyldopa causes a net reduction in the tissue concentration of serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. Overall, methyldopa lowers both standing blood pressure and especially supine blood pressure, with infrequent symptomatic postural hypotension. Methyldopa also reduces plasma renin activity but has negligible effects on glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow, or filtration fraction. It also has no direct effect on cardiac function but in some patients, a slowed heart rate may occur.[L32614]



Following oral administration, blood-pressure-lowering effects are observed within 12 to 24 hours in most patients, and a maximum reduction in blood pressure occurs in 4 to 6 hours.

The retention of phosphate plays a pivotal role in causing secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with osteodystrophy, and soft-tissue calcification. The mechanism by which phosphate retention leads to hyperparathyroidism is not clearly delineated. Therapeutic efforts directed toward the control of hyperphosphatemia include reduction in the dietary intake of phosphate, inhibition of absorption of phosphate in the intestine with phosphate binders, and removal of phosphate from the body by more efficient methods of dialysis. The rate of removal of phosphate by dietary manipulation or by dialysis is insufficient. Dialysis patients absorb 40% to 80% of dietary phosphorus. Therefore, the fraction of dietary phosphate absorbed from the diet needs to be reduced by using phosphate binders in most renal failure patients on maintenance dialysis. Calcium acetate when taken with meals combines with dietary phosphate to form insoluble calcium phosphate which is excreted in the feces.

Alprazolam may also be prescribed off-label for insomnia, premenstrual syndrome, and depression.[A177973]', 'Neurotransmission relies on excitatory and inhibitory signalling. γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type-A receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) are members of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (PLGIC) superfamily located synaptically and perisynaptically to mediate phasic inhibition and extrasynaptically to mediate tonic inhibition. GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs comprise a variety of subunits from a homologous family whose members are named based on sequence identity as one of α1-6, β1-3, γ1-3, δ, ε, θ, π, and ρ1-3. Each subunit possesses an extracellular (ECD), transmembrane (TMD), and intracellular (ICD) domain; inter-subunit interfaces are the primary points of neurotransmitter and modulator binding, described by coordination of the principal (+) and complementary (-) sites in each subunit. Binding of GABA to GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs induces pore opening, rapid flow of chloride ions, and synaptic hyperpolarization, which in turn manifests as an inhibitory signal.[A236793, A236798]



The most prevalent GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs _in vivo_ are the α1β2γ2 receptors, which contain both GABA (β+/α-) and benzodiazepine (BZD, α+/γ-) binding sites in the intersubunit interfaces of the relevant subunits.[A236793, A236798, A236828] In general, any receptors containing an α<sub>x</sub>/γ<sub>z</sub> interface, where x = 1-3,5 and z = 1-3, have potential high-affinity BZD binding sites, although small sequence differences between subunits may alter binding affinity to individual molecules. The α4 and α6 subunits, in which an otherwise conserved histidine is replaced by arginine, do not bind traditional BZD ligands such as diazepam and hence are considered "diazepam-insensitive".[A236793, A236798, A236828] GABA binding results in a series of conformational changes in the ECDs of GABA<sub>A</sub>R β subunits, "locking" each to its neighbouring α- interface. The binding of alprazolam in the high-affinity BZD site stabilizes the α+/γ- interface and facilitates the conformational changes that lead to pore opening, hence functioning as a positive allosteric modulator.[A236833]



The exact manner in which GABA<sub>A</sub>R allosteric modulation mediates the therapeutic and unwanted effects of benzodiazepines remains unclear.[A177973, A18125] Earlier studies suggested that the primary factor was the α subunit composition, with α1-containing receptors mediating the sedative effects, α2/3-containing receptors the anxiolytic effects, and α5-containing receptors the memory effects of benzodiazepines.[A236838] More recent studies suggest a more complex set of factors including subunit composition, physiological location, neuronal circuit, and nerve cell type.[A236843] To further complicate matters, there may be up to five distinct BZD binding sites on GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, with site 1 corresponding to the classical high-affinity α+/γ- interface. The effects of binding at sites 2-4 are not fully understood and likely impart greater complexity to benzodiazepine pharmacological action.[A236798, A236828]', 'Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine that binds γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type-A receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) to enhance their inhibitory effect on neurotransmission, specifically in the brain.[L34783, L34788] Concomitant use with opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death; patients taking benzodiazepines and opioids concurrently may require lower doses of one or both medications, depending on their clinical situation. Patients with pre-existing impaired respiratory function are at increased risk of adverse effects including death during treatment with benzodiazepines. In addition, due to its CNS depressant effects, patients taking alprazolam should avoid operating heavy machinery or driving and should avoid other CNS depressants such as alcohol. As with other benzodiazepines, alprazolam carries a risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which is higher in predisposed individuals and may require strict monitoring. Cessation of therapy may result in acute or protracted withdrawal symptoms, which may be life-threatening; the patient dose should be gradually tapered whenever discontinuation or reduced dosage are necessary. Newborns born to mothers using alprazolam later in pregnancy may suffer from sedation and withdrawal symptoms. As CYP3A is required for the initial step in alprazolam metabolism, alprazolam is contraindicated in patients taking strong CYP3A inhibitors, such as ketoconazole and itraconazole; milder CYP3A inhibitors still necessitate alprazolam dosage adjustments. Lastly, benzodiazepines may have negative effects, such as panic disorders, increased suicide incidence, and episodes of mania/hypomania, in patients suffering from depression.[A18125, A236788, L34783, L34788]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

(2) treatment of pulmonary hypertension, where:

a) the US FDA specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO Group I) in adults to improve exercise ability and delay clinical worsening [F3850]. The delay in clinical worsening was demonstrated when sildenafil was added to background epoprostenol therapy [F3850]. Studies establishing effectiveness were short-term (12 to 16 weeks), and included predominately patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class II-III symptoms and idiopathic etiology (71%) or associated with connective tissue disease (CTD) (25%) [F3850];

In addition, improvement in exercise ability and delay in clinical worsening was demonstrated in adult patients who were already stabilized on background epoprostenol therapy [F3859]; and

Efficacy has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with connective tissue disease [F3883]. The EMA label also indicates sildenafil for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years old with pulmonary arterial hypertension [F3883]. Efficacy in terms of improvement of exercise capacity or pulmonary hemodynamics has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital heart disease [F3883].', 'Sildenafil is an oral therapy for erectile dysfunction [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. In the natural setting, i.e. with sexual stimulation, it restores impaired erectile function by increasing blood flow to the penis [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].



The physiological mechanism responsible for the erection of the penis involves the release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Nitric oxide then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].



Sildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in the corpus cavernosum, where PDE5 is responsible for degradation of cGMP [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Sildenafil has a peripheral site of action on erections [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum but potently enhances the relaxant effect of NO on this tissue [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. When the NO/cGMP pathway is activated, as occurs with sexual stimulation, inhibition of PDE5 by sildenafil results in increased corpus cavernosum levels of cGMP [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611]. Therefore sexual stimulation is required in order for sildenafil to produce its intended beneficial pharmacological effects [A175582, F3853, F3856, F3886, L5611].



Moreover, apart from the presence of PDE5 in the corpus cavernosum of the penis, PDE5 is also present in the pulmonary vasculature [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614]. Sildenafil, therefore, increases cGMP within pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells resulting in relaxation [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614]. In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, this can lead to vasodilation of the pulmonary vascular bed and, to a lesser degree, vasodilatation in the systemic circulation [A175579, F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614].', 'In vitro studies have shown that sildenafil is selective for phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Its effect is more potent on PDE5 than on other known phosphodiesterases [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. In particular, there is a 10-times selectivity over PDE6 which is involved in the phototransduction pathway in the retina [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. There is an 80-times selectivity over PDE1, and over 700-times over PDE 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. And finally, sildenafil has greater than 4,000-times selectivity for PDE5 over PDE3, the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase isoform involved in the control of cardiac contractility [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



In eight double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies of patients with either organic or psychogenic erectile dysfunction, sexual stimulation resulted in improved erections, as assessed by an objective measurement of hardness and duration of erections (via the use of RigiScan®), after sildenafil administration compared with placebo [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Most studies assessed the efficacy of sildenafil approximately 60 minutes post-dose [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The erectile response, as assessed by RigiScan®, generally increased with increasing sildenafil dose and plasma concentration [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The time course of effect was examined in one study, showing an effect for up to 4 hours but the response was diminished compared to 2 hours [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



Sildenafil causes mild and transient decreases in systemic blood pressure which, in the majority of cases, do not translate into clinical effects [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg, three times a day to patients with systemic hypertension the mean change from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was a decrease of 9.4 mmHg and 9.1 mmHg respectively [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg, three times a day to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension lesser effects in blood pressure reduction were observed (a reduction in both systolic and diastolic pressure of 2 mmHg)[F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614] . At the recommended dose of 20 mg three times a day no reductions in systolic or diastolic pressure were seen [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



Single oral doses of sildenafil up to 100 mg in healthy volunteers produced no clinically relevant effects on ECG [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. After chronic dosing of 80 mg three times a day to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension no clinically relevant effects on the ECG were reported either [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



In a study of the hemodynamic effects of a single oral 100 mg dose of sildenafil in 14 patients with severe coronary artery disease (CAD) (> 70 % stenosis of at least one coronary artery), the mean resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased by 7 % and 6 % respectively compared to baseline [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Mean pulmonary systolic blood pressure decreased by 9% [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Sildenafil showed no effect on cardiac output and did not impair blood flow through the stenosed coronary arteries [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].



Mild and transient differences in color discrimination (blue/green) were detected in some subjects using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test at 1 hour following a 100 mg dose, with no effects evident after 2 hours post-dose [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The postulated mechanism for this change in color discrimination is related to inhibition of PDE6, which is involved in the phototransduction cascade of the retina [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Sildenafil has no effect on visual acuity or contrast sensitivity. In a small size placebo-controlled study of patients with documented early age-related macular degeneration (n = 9), sildenafil (single dose, 100 mg) demonstrated no significant changes in visual tests conducted (which included visual acuity, Amsler grid, color discrimination simulated traffic light, and the Humphrey perimeter and photostress test) [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

It has received FDA orphan drug status as an oral medication for this use. A number of studies have shown that melatonin may be effective for treating sleep-wake cycle disturbances in children and adolescents with mental retardation, autism, and other central nervous system disorders. It appears to decrease the time to fall asleep in children with developmental disabilities, such as cerebral palsy, autism, and mental retardation. It may also improve secondary insomnia associated with various sleep-wake cycle disturbances. Other possible uses for which there is some evidence for include: benzodiazepine withdrawal, cluster headache, delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS), primary insomnia, jet lag, nicotine withdrawal, preoperative anxiety and sedation, prostate cancer, solid tumors (when combined with IL-2 therapy in certain cancers), sunburn prevention (topical use), tardive dyskinesia, thrombocytopenia associated with cancer, chemotherapy and other disorders. ', 'Melatonin is a derivative of tryptophan. It binds to melatonin receptor type 1A, which then acts on adenylate cylcase and the inhibition of a cAMP signal transduction pathway. Melatonin not only inhibits adenylate cyclase, but it also activates phosphilpase C. This potentiates the release of arachidonate. By binding to melatonin receptors 1 and 2, the downstream signallling cascades have various effects in the body. The melatonin receptors are G protein-coupled receptors and are expressed in various tissues of the body. There are two subtypes of the receptor in humans, melatonin receptor 1 (MT1) and melatonin receptor 2 (MT2). Melatonin and melatonin receptor agonists, on market or in clinical trials, all bind to and activate both receptor types.The binding of the agonists to the receptors has been investigated for over two decades or since 1986. It is somewhat known, but still not fully understood. When melatonin receptor agonists bind to and activate their receptors it causes numerous physiological processes.

MT1 receptors are expressed in many regions of the central nervous system (CNS): suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SNC), hippocampus, substantia nigra, cerebellum, central dopaminergic pathways, ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens. MT1 is also expressed in the retina, ovary, testis, mammary gland, coronary circulation and aorta, gallbladder, liver, kidney, skin and the immune system. MT2 receptors are expressed mainly in the CNS, also in the lung, cardiac, coronary and aortic tissue, myometrium and granulosa cells, immune cells, duodenum and adipocytes.

The binding of melatonin to melatonin receptors activates a few signaling pathways. MT1 receptor activation inhibits the adenylyl cyclase and its inhibition causes a rippling effect of non activation; starting with decreasing formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and then progressing to less protein kinase A (PKA) activity, which in turn hinders the phosphorilation of cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB binding protein) into P-CREB. MT1 receptors also activate phospholipase C (PLC), affect ion channels and regulate ion flux inside the cell. The binding of melatonin to MT2 receptors inhibits adenylyl cyclase which decreases the formation of cAMP.[4] As well it hinders guanylyl cyclase and therefore the forming of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Binding to MT2 receptors probably affects PLC which increases protein kinase C (PKC) activity. Activation of the receptor can lead to ion flux inside the cell.', 'Melatonin is a hormone normally produced in the pineal gland and released into the blood. The essential amino acid L-tryptophan is a precursor in the synthesis of melatonin. It helps regulate sleep-wake cycles or the circadian rhythm. Production of melatonin is stimulated by darkness and inhibited by light. High levels of melatonin induce sleep and so consumption of the drug can be used to combat insomnia and jet lag.

MT1 and MT2 receptors may be a target for the treatment of circadian and non circadian sleep disorders because of their differences in pharmacology and function within the SCN. SCN is responsible for maintaining the 24 hour cycle which regulates many different body functions ranging from sleep to immune functions

Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), in the regular tablet form (immediate-release), is indicated to relieve pain, fever, and inflammation associated with many conditions, including the flu, the common cold, neck and back pain, dysmenorrhea, headache, tooth pain, sprains, fractures, myositis, neuralgia, synovitis, arthritis, bursitis, burns, and various injuries. It is also used for symptomatic pain relief after surgical and dental procedures [FDA label]. 



The _extra strength_ formulation of acetylsalicylic acid is also indicated for the management migraine pain with photophobia (sensitivity to light) and phonophobia (sensitivity to sound)[FDA label].



**Other indications**



ASA is also indicated for various other purposes, due to its ability to inhibit platelet aggregation. These include: 



Reducing the risk of cardiovascular death in suspected cases of myocardial infarction (MI) [FDA label]. 



Reducing the risk of a first non-fatal myocardial infarction in patients, and for reducing the risk of morbidity and mortality in cases of unstable angina and in those who have had a prior myocardial infarction [FDA label].



For reducing the risk of transient ischemic attacks (TIA) and to prevent atherothrombotic cerebral infarction (in conjunction with other treatments) [FDA label].



For the prevention of thromboembolism after hip replacement surgery [FDA label]. 



For decreasing platelet to platelet adhesion following carotid endarterectomy, aiding in the prevention of transient ischemic attacks (TIA) [FDA label].



Used for patients undergoing hemodialysis with a silicone rubber arteriovenous cannula inserted to prevent thrombosis at the insertion site [FDA Label]. 



**Important note regarding use of the extended-release formulation [F4405]**



In the setting of acute myocardial infarction, or before percutaneous interventions, the extended-release form of acetylsalicylic acid should not be used. Use immediate-release formulations in scenarios requiring rapid onset of action [Label, F4405]. The extended-release form is taken to decrease the incidence of mortality and myocardial infarction (MI) for individuals diagnosed with chronic coronary artery disease (CAD), including patients with previous myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina or with chronic stable angina. Additionally, the extended-release form is used to decrease the risk of death and recurrent episodes of stroke in patients with a history of stroke or TIA [F4405].





 ', 'Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) blocks prostaglandin synthesis. It is non-selective for COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes [A177241, A10989, A32682]. Inhibition of COX-1 results in the inhibition of platelet aggregation for about 7-10 days (average platelet lifespan). The acetyl group of acetylsalicylic acid binds with a serine residue of the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) enzyme, leading to irreversible inhibition. This prevents the production of pain-causing prostaglandins. This process also stops the conversion of arachidonic acid to thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which is a potent inducer of platelet aggregation [FDA label].  Platelet aggregation can result in clots and harmful venous and arterial thromboembolism, leading to conditions such as pulmonary embolism and stroke. 



It is important to note that there is 60% homology between the protein structures of COX-1 and COX-2. ASA binds to serine 516 residue on the active site of COX-2 in the same fashion as its binding to the serine 530 residue located on the active site of COX-1. The active site of COX-2 is, however, slightly larger than the active site of COX-1, so that arachidonic acid (which later becomes prostaglandins) manages to bypass the aspirin molecule inactivating COX-2 [A32682, A177256].  ASA, therefore, exerts more action on the COX-1 receptor rather than on the COX-2 receptor [A177268]. A higher dose of acetylsalicylic acid is required for COX-2 inhibition [A177325]. ', '**Effects on pain and fever**



Acetylsalicylic acid disrupts the production of prostaglandins throughout the body by targeting cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) [A177241, A10989, A32682]. Prostaglandins are potent, irritating substances that have been shown to cause headaches and pain upon injection into humans.  Prostaglandins increase the sensitivity of pain receptors and substances such as histamine and bradykinin. Through the disruption of the production and prevention of release of prostaglandins in inflammation, this drug may stop their action at pain receptors, preventing symptoms of pain. Acetylsalicylic acid is considered an antipyretic agent because of its ability to interfere with the production of brain prostaglandin E1. Prostaglandin E1 is known to be an extremely powerful fever-inducing agent [FDA label]. 



**Effects on platelet aggregation**



The inhibition of platelet aggregation by ASA occurs because of its interference with thromboxane A2 in platelets, caused by COX-1 inhibition. Thromboxane A2 is an important lipid responsible for platelet aggregation, which can lead to clot formation and future risk of heart attack or stroke  [FDA label]. 



**A note on cancer prevention**



ASA has been studied in recent years to determine its effect on the prevention of various malignancies [A177325]. In general, acetylsalicylic acid is involved in the interference of various cancer signaling pathways, sometimes inducing or upregulating tumor suppressor genes [A177325, A177403]. Results of various studies suggest that there are beneficial effects of long-term ASA use in the prevention of several types of cancer, including stomach, colorectal, pancreatic, and liver cancers [A177400].

Corticosteroids like betamethasone can act through nongenomic and genomic pathways.[A31458] The genomic pathway is slower and occurs when glucocorticoids activate glucocorticoid receptors and initiate downstream effects that promote transcription of anti-inflammatory genes including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), IL-1-receptor antagonist, and tyrosine amino transferase (TAT).[A31458] On the other hand, the nongenomic pathway is able to elicit a quicker response by modulating T-cell, platelet and monocyte activity through the use of existing membrane-bound receptors and second messengers.[A31458]', 'Corticosteroids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor inhibiting pro-inflammatory signals, while promoting anti-inflammatory signals.[A187463] Corticosteroids have a wide therapeutic window as patients may require doses that are multiples of what the body naturally produces.[A187463] Patients who require long-term treatment with a corticosteroid should be counselled regarding the risk of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression and increased susceptibility to infections.[A187463]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Eventually, cell lysis may occur due to weakening of the cell wall, and loss of turgor pressure and subsequent rupture of the cytoplasmic membrane [A32441]. The loss of 260-nm-absorbing material may be indicative of a damaged cytoplasmic membrane and loss of nucleic acids [A32441]. In _E. coli_, perturbed potassium homeostasis, glucose-dependent respiration, cell morphology, and ability to exclude propidium iodide was observed. 



Tea tree oil also mediates its antifungal actions in a similar way, where it alters the permeability of Candida albicans and inhibits its respiration in a dose-dependent manner [A32439]. Plasma and mitochondrial membranes of fungal species are also thought to be negatively affected by inhibition of glucose-induced medium acidification by tea tree oil, which involves inhibition of membrane ATPase responsible for the expulsion of protons [A32439]. Tea tree oil also inhibits the formation of germ tubes, or mycelial conversion, in _C. albicans_, thereby disrupting cell morphogenesis [A32439]. Water-soluble fraction of TTO, terpinen-4-ol, and α-terpineol, can inhibit the lipopolysaccharide-induced production of the inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-10 by human peripheral monocytes by approximately 50% and that of prostaglandin E2 by about 30% after 40 h [A32439].

Thrombin is a serine protease that is required to activate fibrinogen to fibrin, which is the loose meshwork that completes the clotting process. Since one molecule of factor Xa can generate more than 1000 molecules of thrombin, selective inhibitors of factor Xa are profoundly useful in terminating the amplification of thrombin generation.

Secondly, it is an oral agent whereas the widely used unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparins are for parenteral use only.

When activated, presynaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptors causes neuron hyperpolarization and reduces the firing rate of the serotonergic neuron, thereby decreasing extracellular 5-HT levels in the neuron''s projection areas. Activated postsynaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors promote hyperpolarization to released 5-HT on pyramidal neurons.[A182420] 



The anxiolytic action of buspirone is mainly thought to arise from the interaction at presynaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptors. Acting as a potent agonist in these receptors, buspirone initially causes activation of these autoreceptors and inhibition of 5-HT release. It is proposed that buspirone induces desensitization of somatodendritic autoreceptors over time, which may explain the delayed onset of action of the drug. Desensitization of the autoreceptors ultimately results in heightened excitation of serotonergic neurons and enhanced 5-HT release.[T28] Buspirone also displays a weak affinity for serotonin 5HT2 receptors and acts as a weak antagonist on dopamine D2 autoreceptors,[L7375] although there is not much evidence that the action at these receptors contribute to the anxiolytic effect of buspirone.[A182312] It acts as an antagonist at presynaptic dopamine D3 and D4 receptors and may bind to alpha-1 adrenergic receptors as a partial agonist.[A181751]', 'The clinical effect of buspirone in alleviating the symptoms of generalized anxiety disorders typically takes 2 to 4 weeks to achieve.[L7375] The delayed onset of action of buspirone suggests that the therapeutic effectiveness in generalized anxiety may involved more than its molecular mechanism of action at the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors,[T28] or buspirone may induce adaptations of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors.[L7375] Buspirone was not shown to alter the psychomotor or cognitive function in healthy volunteers, and the risk of developing sedation is relatively low compared to other anxiolytics, such as benzodiazepines.[A180985] Unlike benzodiazepines and barbiturates used in anxiety disorders, buspirone is not associated with a risk for developing physical dependence or withdrawal, or any significant interaction with central nervous system depressants such as ethanol. This is due to the lack of effects on GABA receptors.[A180985,L7375] Buspirone also does not exhibit any anticonvulsant or muscle-relaxing properties,[A182309] but may interfere with arousal reactions due to its inhibitory action on the aactivity of noradrenergic locus coerulus neurons.[T28]



Despite its clinical effectiveness in generalized anxiety, buspirone demonstrated limited clinical effectiveness on panic disorders, severe anxiety, phobias, and obsessive compulsive disorders.[A181751,T28] The clinical effectiveness of the long-term use of buspirone, for more than 3 to 4 weeks, has not demonstrated in controlled trials but there were no observable significant adverse events in patients receiving buspirone for a year in a study of long-term use.[L4478]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

The concentration of oxytocin receptors on the myometrium increases significantly during pregnancy and reaches a peak in early labor.[L31433] Activation of oxytocin receptors on the myometrium triggers a downstream cascade that leads to increased intracellular calcium in uterine myofibrils which strengthens and increases the frequency of uterine contractions.[L31433,A228958,A228718]



In humans, most hormones are regulated by negative feedback; however, oxytocin is one of the few that is regulated by positive feedback.[A228958] The head of the fetus pushing on the cervix signals the release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary of the mother.[A228958] Oxytocin then travels to the uterus where it stimulates uterine contractions.[A228958] The elicited uterine contractions will then stimulate the release of increasing amounts of oxytocin.[A228958] This positive feedback loop will continue until parturition.[A228958]

Proton pump inhibitors such as pantoprazole are substituted _benzimidazole_ derivatives, weak bases, which accumulate in the acidic space of the parietal cell before being converted in the _canaliculi_  (small canal) of the gastric parietal cell, an acidic environment, to active _sulfenamide_ derivatives. This active form then makes disulfide bonds with important cysteines on the gastric acid pump, inhibiting its function.[A174247] Specifically, pantoprazole binds to the _sulfhydryl group_ of H+, K+-ATPase, which is an enzyme implicated in accelerating the final step in the acid secretion pathway.

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as pantoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]



PPIs such as pantoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes [A177577, A177580]. 



**A note on laboratory testing abnormalities**



During treatment with antisecretory medicinal products such as pantoprazole, serum gastrin (a peptide hormone that stimulates secretion of gastric acid) increases in response to the decreased acid secretion caused by proton pump inhibition. The increased gastrin level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Published evidence suggests that proton pump inhibitors should be stopped 14 days before chromogranin A (CgA) measurements. This permits chromogranin A levels, that might be falsely elevated after proton pump inhibitor treatment, to return to the normal reference range.[F3217]

Atomoxetine has been shown to specifically increase norepinephrine and dopamine within the prefrontal cortex, which results in improved ADHD symptoms.[A18262, A18262, F4639]



Due to atomoxetine''s noradrenergic activity, it also has effects on the cardiovascular system such as increased blood pressure and tachycardia.[T244] Sudden deaths, stroke, and myocardial infarction have been reported in patients taking atomoxetine at usual doses for ADHD. Atomoxetine should be used with caution in patients whose underlying medical conditions could be worsened by increases in blood pressure or heart rate such as certain patients with hypertension, tachycardia, or cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. It should not be used in patients with severe cardiac or vascular disorders whose condition would be expected to deteriorate if they experienced clinically important increases in blood pressure or heart rate. Although the role of atomoxetine in these cases is unknown, consideration should be given to not treating patients with clinically significant cardiac abnormalities. Patients who develop symptoms such as exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or other symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease during atomoxetine treatment should undergo a prompt cardiac evaluation.[F4639]



In general, particular care should be taken in treating ADHD in patients with comorbid bipolar disorder because of concern for possible induction of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Treatment emergent psychotic or manic symptoms, e.g., hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania in children and adolescents without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania can be caused by atomoxetine at usual doses. If such symptoms occur, consideration should be given to a possible causal role of atomoxetine, and discontinuation of treatment should be considered.[F4639]



Atomoxetine capsules increased the risk of suicidal ideation in short-term studies in children and adolescents with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). All pediatric patients being treated with atomoxetine  should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.[F4639]



Postmarketing reports indicate that atomoxetine can cause severe liver injury. Although no evidence of liver injury was detected in clinical trials of about 6000 patients, there have been rare cases of clinically significant liver injury that were considered probably or possibly related to atomoxetine use in postmarketing experience. Rare cases of liver failure have also been reported, including a case that resulted in a liver transplant. Atomoxetine should be discontinued in patients with jaundice or laboratory evidence of liver injury, and should not be restarted.

Animal studies have shown that _ginkgo biloba_ works on several neurotransmitter pathways and brain structures. Flavones were shown to inhibit lipid peroxidation; inhibit the uptake of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine; and inhibit platelet aggregation.[A232404] Terpene lactones may also act as potent antagonists of the platelet-activating factor and may possess anti-ischemic and fibrinolytic effects.[A232379] They were also shown to downregulate adrenal peripheral benzodiazepine receptors and increase adrenocorticotropic hormone levels.[A232404] _Ginkgo biloba_ also reversibly inhibits monoamine oxidase A; and modestly inhibits anticholinesterase activity,[A232379, A232389] leading to enhanced cholinergic transmission in the brain.[A232394] 



Several studies suggest that _ginkgo biloba_ exerts neuroprotective effects by reducing free radical production in the prefrontal cortex, which may explain its improvement on short-term memory. _Ginkgo biloba_ extract acts as a free radical scavenger, protecting neurons from oxidative damage and apoptosis related to aging, cerebral ischemia, and neurodegenerative disorders.[A232379] _Ginkgo biloba_ also inhibits amyloid-β neurotoxicity and protects against hypoxic challenges and increased oxidative stress.[A232389] One study showed that bilobalide, a terpene lactone, delays the onset of hypoxic glycolysis.[A232404] _Ginkgo biloba_ has the potential to regulate metabolism, stabilize the membrane, and promote vasodilation. In the arterial endothelium, EGb stimulated the release of endogenous relaxing factors, such as endothelium-derived relaxing factor and prostacyclin. In the inflammatory environment that causes tissue damage, EGb promoted nitric oxide production, leading to enhanced peripheral and cerebral blood flow.[A232379] ', '_Ginkgo biloba_ is a herbal ingredient with demonstrated antioxidant, vasoactive, antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, antiplatelet, and fibrinolytic properties.[A232389, A232399] _Ginkgo biloba_ has been investigated for use in a variety of medical conditions, but the most extensively studied area is in the context of cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative disorders. _Ginkgo biloba_ was examined as a potential nootropic agent or cognitive enhancer but research findings supporting the therapeutic efficacy of _ginkgo biloba_ extract (EGb) in dementia remain controversial. Some clinical studies of dementia that were up to one year long showed that EGb improves the cognitive performance and social functioning of patients. However, other studies did not support its clinical benefit for patients with cognitive impairment and dementia. Numerous meta-analysis studies showed insufficient evidence of the effectiveness of EGb in reducing both all-cause dementia incidence and Alzheimer''s disease-associated dementia incidence in elderly patients with normal cognition or with mild cognitive impairment. Additionally, there is no up-to-date evidence that demonstrates the benefit of the long-term use of standardized EGb in reducing the risk of progression to Alzheimer''s disease. A 2012 meta-analysis did not support the use of EGb in enhancing cognitive function in healthy adults.[A232379]



In the context of cardiovascular diseases, a limited number of studies showed that EGb improved mortality or neurological recovery in the post-stroke period, reduced cognitive and neurological impairment after acute ischemic stroke, and improved blood flow in the coronary artery in patients with coronary artery disease. However, a systemic review found no statistical or clinically significant benefit of EGb for patients with peripheral arterial disease or hypertension. Overall, there is a lack of strong evidence in the use of EGb for the treatment or prevention of cardiovascular diseases.[A232379]



In a small trial, the use of EGb as an adjunctive treatment with citalopram improved depressive symptoms and cognitive function in patients with depression.[A232379] _Ginkgo biloba_ was also investigated as a potential treatment for antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction.[A2434] Another study showed EGb improving the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia. There is insufficient evidence to prove the effectiveness of EGb in these psychiatric disorders. Limited studies have investigated the role of _ginkgo biloba_ in the treatment of vertigo, tinnitus, vitiligo, macular degeneration, and glaucoma, as well as the prevention of acute mountain sickness.

Its combination of orthosteric and allosteric activity on SERT allows for greater extracellular 5-HT levels, a faster onset of action, and greater efficacy as compared to other SSRIs. [A185825,A185726] The sustained elevation of synaptic 5-HT eventually causes desensitization of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> auto-receptors, which normally shut down endogenous 5-HT release in the presence of excess 5-HT - this desensitization may be necessary for the full clinical effect of SSRIs and may be responsible for their typically prolonged onset of action.[A185828,A185726]



Escitalopram has shown little-to-no binding affinity at a number of other receptors, such as histamine and muscarinic receptors, and minor activity at these off-targets may explain some of its adverse effects.[L8513,L8516,L8522,A185726]', 'Escitalopram belongs to a class of medications called selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs).

', 'Two key active ingredients in _ginkgo biloba_ are terpene lactones (notably ginkgolides and diterpenes) and ginkgo flavone glycosides (notably ginkgetin, bilobetin, and sciadopitysin), which are present at varying concentrations. _Ginkgo biloba_ extract EGb 761 is the standardized extract of _ginkgo biloba_ used in studies, which contains 6% terpenoids and 24% flavonoid glycosides. Animal studies have shown that _ginkgo biloba_ works on several neurotransmitter pathways and brain structures. Flavones were shown to inhibit lipid peroxidation; inhibit the uptake of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine; and inhibit platelet aggregation.[A232404] Terpene lactones may also act as potent antagonists of the platelet-activating factor and may possess anti-ischemic and fibrinolytic effects.[A232379] They were also shown to downregulate adrenal peripheral benzodiazepine receptors and increase adrenocorticotropic hormone levels.[A232404] _Ginkgo biloba_ also reversibly inhibits monoamine oxidase A; and modestly inhibits anticholinesterase activity,[A232379, A232389] leading to enhanced cholinergic transmission in the brain.[A232394] 



Several studies suggest that _ginkgo biloba_ exerts neuroprotective effects by reducing free radical production in the prefrontal cortex, which may explain its improvement on short-term memory. _Ginkgo biloba_ extract acts as a free radical scavenger, protecting neurons from oxidative damage and apoptosis related to aging, cerebral ischemia, and neurodegenerative disorders.[A232379] _Ginkgo biloba_ also inhibits amyloid-β neurotoxicity and protects against hypoxic challenges and increased oxidative stress.[A232389] One study showed that bilobalide, a terpene lactone, delays the onset of hypoxic glycolysis.[A232404] _Ginkgo biloba_ has the potential to regulate metabolism, stabilize the membrane, and promote vasodilation. In the arterial endothelium, EGb stimulated the release of endogenous relaxing factors, such as endothelium-derived relaxing factor and prostacyclin. In the inflammatory environment that causes tissue damage, EGb promoted nitric oxide production, leading to enhanced peripheral and cerebral blood flow.[A232379] ', '_Ginkgo biloba_ is a herbal ingredient with demonstrated antioxidant, vasoactive, antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, antiplatelet, and fibrinolytic properties.[A232389, A232399] _Ginkgo biloba_ has been investigated for use in a variety of medical conditions, but the most extensively studied area is in the context of cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative disorders. _Ginkgo biloba_ was examined as a potential nootropic agent or cognitive enhancer but research findings supporting the therapeutic efficacy of _ginkgo biloba_ extract (EGb) in dementia remain controversial. Some clinical studies of dementia that were up to one year long showed that EGb improves the cognitive performance and social functioning of patients. However, other studies did not support its clinical benefit for patients with cognitive impairment and dementia. Numerous meta-analysis studies showed insufficient evidence of the effectiveness of EGb in reducing both all-cause dementia incidence and Alzheimer''s disease-associated dementia incidence in elderly patients with normal cognition or with mild cognitive impairment. Additionally, there is no up-to-date evidence that demonstrates the benefit of the long-term use of standardized EGb in reducing the risk of progression to Alzheimer''s disease. A 2012 meta-analysis did not support the use of EGb in enhancing cognitive function in healthy adults.[A232379]



In the context of cardiovascular diseases, a limited number of studies showed that EGb improved mortality or neurological recovery in the post-stroke period, reduced cognitive and neurological impairment after acute ischemic stroke, and improved blood flow in the coronary artery in patients with coronary artery disease. However, a systemic review found no statistical or clinically significant benefit of EGb for patients with peripheral arterial disease or hypertension. Overall, there is a lack of strong evidence in the use of EGb for the treatment or prevention of cardiovascular diseases.[A232379]



In a small trial, the use of EGb as an adjunctive treatment with citalopram improved depressive symptoms and cognitive function in patients with depression.[A232379] _Ginkgo biloba_ was also investigated as a potential treatment for antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction.[A2434] Another study showed EGb improving the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia. There is insufficient evidence to prove the effectiveness of EGb in these psychiatric disorders. Limited studies have investigated the role of _ginkgo biloba_ in the treatment of vertigo, tinnitus, vitiligo, macular degeneration, and glaucoma, as well as the prevention of acute mountain sickness.

Levetiracetam is also available as an orally dissolvable tablet that is indicated as an adjunct in the treatment of partial onset seizures in patients with epilepsy who are 4 years of age and older and weigh more than 20kg.[L8609]', 'The exact mechanism through which levetiracetam exerts its anti-epileptic effects is unclear, but is thought to be unique amongst other anti-epileptic medications. Current knowledge suggests that levetiracetam’s binding to synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) is a key driver of its action. SV2A is a membrane-bound protein that is found on synaptic vesicles and is ubiquitous throughout the CNS[A12546] - it appears to play a role in vesicle exocytosis[L8606,L8615] and in the modulation of synaptic transmission by increasing the available amount of secretory vesicles available for neurotransmission.[A12552] Stimulation of pre-synaptic SV2A by levetiracetam may inhibit neurotransmitter release,[A12551] but this action does not appear to affect normal neurotransmission. This has led to the suggestion that levetiracetam exclusively modulates the function of SV2A only under pathophysiological conditions.[A12546] Levetiracetam and related analogues showed a correlation between affinity for SV2A and anti-epileptic potency, further suggesting that action at this site contributes to the anti-epileptic activity of the drug.[L8606,L8615]



Levetiracetam has also been shown to indirectly affect GABAergic neurotransmission (despite having no direct effect on GABAergic or glutamatergic receptors) and modulate ionic currents.[A12552] Similarly, levetiracetam has been shown in vitro to inhibit N-type calcium channels.[A16562] How, or even if, these actions are implicated in its anti-epileptic action have yet to be elucidated.', 'Levetiracetam appears to prevent seizure activity via the selective inhibition of hypersynchronized epileptiform burst firing without affecting normal neuronal transmission, though the exact mechanism through which this occurs is unclear.[L8606,L8615] The therapeutic index of levetiracetam is wide,[L8615,A185918] making it relatively unique amongst other anti-epileptic medications.

DNA gyrase is an enzyme found only in bacteria that introduces negative supercoils into DNA during replication - this helps to relieve torsional strain caused by the introduction of positive supercoils during replication, and these negative supercoils are essential for chromosome condensation and the promotion of transcription initiation.[A31453] It is comprised of four subunits (two A subunits and two B subunits) of which the A subunits appear to be the target of fluoroquinolone antibiotics.[A190663] Bacterial topoisomerase IV, in addition to contributing to the relaxation of positive supercoils, is essential at the terminal stages of DNA replication and functions to “unlink” newly replicated chromosomes to allow for the completion of cell division.[A31453]

PGE<sub>2</sub> is the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.[A179023] It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.[T116,A179023] PGE<sub>2</sub> activates the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled EP<sub>1</sub> receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE<sub>2</sub> also activates the EP<sub>4</sub> receptor, coupled to G<sub>s</sub>, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE<sub>2</sub> act via EP<sub>3</sub> to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP<sub>2</sub> to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI<sub>2</sub> is known to play a role via its G<sub>s</sub>-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.



PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP<sub>2</sub> receptors.[T116,A179044] Similarly to β adrenergic receptors these are G<sub>s</sub>-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE<sub>2</sub> also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.[T116] PGD<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP<sub>1</sub> receptor.[A179044] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.



PGE<sub>2</sub> can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory G<sub>q</sub> EP<sub>3</sub> receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.[T116] This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever. NSAIDs prevent the generation of PGE<sub>2</sub> thereby reducing the activity of these neurons.

Following irradiation, aloe polysaccharides block the upregulation of pro-apoptotic p53, Bax, and Bad while blocking downregulating anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 [A32473]. _In vivo_, aloe polysaccharides may act as a scavenger for oxygen free radicals including DPPH, alkyl radicals, superoxides, and singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals that may also be generated by superoxides [A32470, A32476]. Hydrogen peroxide, which is a weak initiate lipid peroxidation, may also be effectively scavenged by aloe polysaccharides [A32476]. In a Fenton reaction system, aloe polysaccharides demonstrated a concentration-dependent scavenging activity against hydroxyl radical that were generated during the reaction [A32476]. Aloe polysaccharides may also compete with oxygen to react with nitric oxide (NO), thereby inhibiting the generation of nitrite and peroxynitrite anions that act as free radicals [A32476]. 



Findings from a study investigating the effects of aloe polysaccharides on doxorubicin-induced oxidative stress suggest that aloe polysaccharides mediate potent antioxidant actions _in vivo_ [A32476]. Doxorubicin, known to generate reactive oxygen species such as superoxide and hydroxy radicals, was administered to albino rats. This led to myocardial oxidative stress and cardiac injury accompanied by leakage of LDH and CPK from cardiac myocytes and to serum due to lipid peroxidation of cardiac membranes, reduced levels of antioxidant coenzyme GSH, and increased levels of SOD from a compensatory and combative mechanism of oxidative stress [A32476]. Treatment with aloe polysaccharides resulted in a significant decrease in serum LDH and CPK levels, indicating that aloe polysaccharides are capable in stabilizing cardiac membranes from peroxidative damage. Restored levels of endogenous GSH and SOD in a dose-dependent manner were also observed with the treatment of aloe polysaccharides, suggesting that aloe polysaccharides exhibit potent antioxidant properties [A32476].



In a study of rats with open cutaneous back wounds, treatment with aloe polysaccharides decreased the levels of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) and induced tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) during the early stage of wound repair, resulting in decreased collagen breakdown and increased preservation of collagen content in the injured area [A32471].

NO activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which converts guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic guanosine 3'',5''-monophosphate (cGMP) in vascular smooth muscle and other tissues.[A180166,A180169,A249970] cGMP is an endogenous vasodilator of vascular smooth muscle:[A180172] it causes protein kinase-dependent phosphorylation and activates downstream cascades that promote relaxation and increased blood flow in veins, arteries and cardiac tissue.[A180172,A249970] An _in vitro_ study using mouse aorta suggests that nitric oxide, an active metabolite of nitroglycerin, targets the natriuretic peptide receptors.[A5526] ', 'Nitroglycerin causes the relaxation of vascular smooth muscles, causing arteriolar and venous dilatation.[L38369] It increases blood flow to the myocardium and reduces cardiac preload and afterload, decreasing myocardial wall stress and ameliorating anginal symptoms.[A180172,A249970,L7102] Nitroglycerin also reduces coronary artery spasm, decreasing systemic vascular resistance as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure.[L38369]



Like other organic nitrates, repeated and prolonged administration of nitroglycerin can lead to the development of tolerance or desensitization of vascular smooth muscle to further nitroglycerin-induced vasorelaxation. This loss of efficacy may be associated with the inhibition of mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase, which is an important enzyme involved in the bioactivation of nitroglycerin.[A180166,A180169,A180172] Nitroglycerin tolerance may be accompanied by pro-oxidant effects, endothelial dysfunction, and increased sensitivity to vasoconstrictors.[A180172]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Furthermore, some formulations like chewable montelukast tablets may also be specifically indicated by particular regulatory bodies for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma, including the prevention of day and night-time symptoms, the treatment of acetylsalicylic acid based asthma, and the prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in adult and pediatric patients aged 2 and older[L6328], between the ages 2 and 5[L6325], or between the ages of 6 and 14 years.[L6331]



Moreover, when employed for such indications montelukast is considered effective as monotherapy or when combined with other medications indicated for the maintenance treatment of chronic asthma.[L6304,L6328] For instance, montelukast and inhaled corticosteroids can be used concomitantly to demonstrate additive effects to control asthma or to decrease the necessary inhaled corticosteroid dose while still maintaining clinical stability.[L6304,L6328]



Additionally, in patients who continue to experience asthma symptoms, montelukast can also be combined with an ''as required'' short-acting beta-agonist, an inhaled corticosteroid, or inhaled corticosteroid paired with a long-acting beta-agonist.[L6304,L6328]', 'Cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLT) like LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4, among others, are eicosanoids released by a variety of cells like mast cells and eosinophils.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] When such CysLT bind to corresponding CysLT receptors like CysLT type-1 receptors located on respiratory airway smooth muscle cells, airway macrophages, and on various pro-inflammatory cells like eosinophils and some specific myeloid stem cells activities that facilitate the pathophysiology of asthma and allergic rhinitis are stimulated.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]



In particular, CysLT-mediated airway bronchoconstriction, occluding mucous secretion, vascular permeability, and eosinophil recruitment are all types of effects that facilitate asthma.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Alternatively, in allergic rhinitis, CysLTs are released by the nasal mucosa when exposed to allergens during both early and late phase reactions and participate in eliciting symptoms of allergic rhinitis like a congested nose and airway.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]



Subsequently, montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that binds with high affinity and selectivity to the CysLT type 1 receptor, which consequently assists in inhibiting any physiological actions of CysLTs like LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 at the receptor that may facilitate asthma or allergic rhinitis.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]', 'Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that demonstrates a marked affinity and selectivity to the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor type-1 in preference to many other crucial airway receptors like the prostanoid, cholinergic, or beta-adrenergic receptors.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] As a consequence, the agent can elicit substantial blockage of LTD4 leukotriene-mediated bronchoconstriction with doses as low as 5 mg.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Moreover, a placebo-controlled, crossover study (n=12) demonstrated that montelukast is capable of inhibiting early and late phase bronchoconstriction caused by antigen challenge by 75% and 57% respectively.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]

5-HT4 receptors can be found throughout the gastrointestinal tract primarily in smooth muscle cells, enterochromaffin cells, and myenteric plexus. Its activation produces the release of acetylcholine which is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the GI tract.[A37348]



Hence, prucalopride stimulates motility by interacting specifically with 5-HT4 receptors in the GI tract which causes a release of acetylcholine and further contraction of the muscle layer of the colon and relaxation of the circular muscle layer leading to the propulsion of luminal content.[A14331]', 'In animal studies, prucalopride induced a dose-dependent stimulation of contractile activity in the proximal colon and inhibition of the contractility in the distal colon.[A40253] As well it has been shown that prucalopride stimulates and amplifies giant migratory contraction which is the high-amplitude type of contraction that initiates the urge to defecate. Thus, prucalopride not only accelerates the colonic transit but also accelerates gastric emptying and small bowel transit.[A37348] 



In supratherapeutic concentrations, prucalopride can be observed to interact with hERG potassium channels and L-type calcium channels.[A37348]



In clinical trials, prucalopride showed to significantly increase the spontaneous bowel movements with a standardized mean difference of about 0.5 after the use of 1 mg when compared with the placebo group.[A40254] In this studies as well, it was observed a numerical improvement in mean colonic transit time and a significant increase in spontaneous complete bowel movement without marked changes in the anorectal function.[A40254]

The use of ibuprofen and its enantiomer [DB09213] in a racemic mix is common for the management of mild to moderate pain related to dysmenorrhea, headache, migraine, postoperative dental pain, spondylitis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and soft tissue disorder.[A39097]



Due to its activity against prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis, ibuprofen has been attributed to alteration of platelet function and prolongation of gestation and labour.[A39092]



As ibuprofen is a widely used medication, the main therapeutic indications are:



* Patent Ductus Arteriosus - it is a neonatal condition wherein the ductus arteriosus (blood vessel that connects the main pulmonary artery to the proximal descending aorta) fails to close after birth causing severe risk of heart failure. The prostaglandin inhibition of ibuprofen has been studied for the treatment of this condition as it is known that prostaglandin E2 is responsible for keeping the ductus arteriosus open.[A39100]



* Rheumatoid- and osteo-arthritis - ibuprofen is very commonly used in the symptomatic treatment of inflammatory, musculoskeletal and rheumatic disorders.[A39176]



* Cystic fibrosis - the use of high dosages of ibuprofen has been proven to decrease inflammation and decreasing polymorphonuclear cell influx in the lungs.[A39177]



* Orthostatic hypotension - ibuprofen can induce sodium retention and antagonize the effect of diuretics which has been reported to be beneficial for patients with severe orthostatic hypotension.[A1651]



* Dental pain - ibuprofen is used to manage acute and chronic orofacial pain.[A10901]



* Pain - ibuprofen is widely used to reduce minor aches and pains as well as to reduce fever and manage dysmenorrhea. It is very commonly used for the relief of acute indications such as fever and tension headaches.[A39092] It is also used to manage mild to moderate pain and moderate to severe pain as an adjunct to opioid analgesics.[L40208]



* Investigational uses - efforts have been put into developing ibuprofen for the prophylaxis of Alzheimer''s disease, Parkinson disease, and breast cancer.[A39092]', 'The exact mechanism of action of ibuprofen is unknown. However, ibuprofen is considered an NSAID and thus it is a non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, which is an enzyme involved in prostaglandin (mediators of pain and fever) and thromboxane (stimulators of blood clotting) synthesis via the arachidonic acid pathway.[L4614]



Ibuprofen is a non-selective COX inhibitor and hence, it inhibits the activity of both COX-1 and COX-2. The inhibition of COX-2 activity decreases the synthesis of prostaglandins involved in mediating inflammation, pain, fever, and swelling while the inhibition of COX-1 is thought to cause some of the side effects of ibuprofen including GI ulceration.[A39195]', 'Ibuprofen has multiple actions in different inflammatory pathways involved in acute and chronic inflammation. The main effects reported in ibuprofen are related to the control of pain, fever and acute inflammation by the inhibition of the synthesis of prostanoids by COX-1 and COX-2. Pain relief is attributed to peripheral affected regions and central nervous system effects in the pain transmission mediated by the dorsal horn and higher spinothalamic tract. Some reports have tried to link the pain regulation with a possible enhancement on the synthesis of endogenous cannabinoids and action on the NMDA receptors. The effect on pain has been shown to be related to the cortically evoked potentials.[A39190]



The antipyretic effect is reported to be linked to the effect on the prostanoid synthesis due to the fact that the prostanoids are the main signaling mediator of pyresis in the hypothalamic-preoptic region.[A39190]



The use of ibuprofen in dental procedures is attributed to the local inhibition of prostanoid production as well as to anti-oedemic activity and an increase of plasma beta-endorphins. Some reports have suggested a rapid local reduction of the expression of COX-2 in dental pulp derived by the administration of ibuprofen.[A39190]



The administration of ibuprofen in patients with rheumatic diseases has shown to control joint symptoms.[A39092] 



Ibuprofen is largely used in OTC products such as an agent for the management of dysmenorrhea which has been proven to reduce the amount of menstrual prostanoids and to produce a reduction in the uterine hypercontractility.[A39181] As well, it has been reported to reduce significantly the fever and the pain caused by migraines.[A39182, A39183] This effect is thought to be related to the effect on platelet activation and thromboxane A2 production which produces local vascular effects in the affected regions. This effect is viable as ibuprofen can enter in the central nervous system.[A39190]



In the investigational uses of ibuprofen, it has been reported to reduce neurodegeneration when given in low doses over a long time.[A39184] On the other hand, its use in Parkinson disease is related to the importance of inflammation and oxidative stress in the pathology of this condition.[A39185] The use of ibuprofen for breast cancer is related to a study that shows a decrease of 50% in the rate of breast cancer.[A39186]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Hyaluronic acid works by two basic mechanisms: serving as a passive structural molecule or serving as signaling molecule, depending on the molecule size. The physicochemical properties of high molecular weight HA contribute to passive structural effects, demonstrating hygroscopicity and viscoelasticity and improving hydration, water balance, and structural integrity. As a signalling  molecule interacting with proteins, HA causes several opposing effects based on molecular weight: pro- or anti-inflammatory effects, promotion or inhibition of cell migration, and activating or inhibiting cell division.[A230133] 



Hyaluronic acid exerts its therapeutic effects through binding to three primary types of cell surface receptors: CD44 (a membrane glycoprotein), the receptor for hyaluronate-mediated motility (RHAMM), and the Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1). CD44 is considered the most widely distributed receptor for hyaluronic acid, demonstrating cellular interactions with osteopontin, collagen, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).  High and low molecular weight hyaluronic acids demonstrate differing molecular and cellular mechanisms in their interaction with CD44 receptors. Some examples of these effects include modification of chondrocyte survival pathways in addition to alteration of apoptosis pathways.  Lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor (LYVE-1), and hyaluronic acid receptor for endocytosis (HARE), (also known as Stabilin-2) also bind to hyaluronic acid.[A230128] 



Hyaluronic acid for skin conditions and cosmetics



Hyaluronic acid''s anionic proprieties cause it to attract water and induce swelling, increasing tissue volume and skin structural integrity. The aging process is associated with reduced production of skin hyaluronic acid and collagen, causing the appearance of wrinkles and the loss of facial volume. Dermal fillers of hyaluronic acid replace lost tissue volume, imparting a full and youthful appearance to skin that has lost its elasticity. Hyaluronic acid fillers contain cross-linked hyaluronic acid particles, rendering a concentrated substance with resistance to various forms of physical and chemical breakdown. The cosmetic benefits of hyaluronic acid filler may last up to 6 months, depending on the brand and technique used for injection.[L32193] Additionally, dermal hyaluronic acid fillers are known to increase the production of fibroblasts[L32193], supporting wound healing and offering relief from irritating and inflammatory skin conditions.[A230118]





Hyaluronic acid for joint pain



Most cells in the human body are capable of synthesizing HA. It is a primary component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and can be found in bone marrow, cartilage, and synovial fluid in joints.[A230128] In osteoarthritis, the concentration of naturally occurring hyaluronic acid gradually decreases, lowering the viscosity of synovial fluid that protects joints from excess friction. Administration of intra-articular hyaluronic acid increases viscosity of synovial joint fluid, reducing friction and subsequently relieving painful arthritic symptoms.[L32193]





Hyaluronic acid for ophthalmic conditions and ophthalmological procedures



Solutions of hyaluronic acid with a concentration greater than 0.1% moisturize the surface of the eyes to treat symptoms of dry eye while improving the stabilization of tear film, replenishing deficiencies of HA, reducing friction, and preventing binding of foreign substances to the ocular tissue.[A230128,L32193] Hyaluronic acid is frequently used during and after ophthalmological surgeries and plays important roles by virtue of its moisturizing, viscoelastic, and protective properties. It promotes tissue healing of the corneal epithelium and other parts of the eye following ophthalmological surgery, minimizing the risk of adhesions and free radical formation.[A230128]

', 'HA has long-acting lubricant, shock absorbing, joint stabilizing, and water balancing properties.[A230128,L32193] It is similar to the naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan (GAG) in joints. Hyaluronic acid works by acting as a lubricant and shock absorber, facilitating joint mobility and thereby reducing osteoarthritic pain.  Hyaluronic acid has antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic effects.[A230128] The water-balancing properties and viscoelasticity of hyaluronic acid are beneficial in cosmetic injections, imparting volume and reducing the appearance of imperfections and wrinkles.[L32193] Due to the abovementioned properties, HA has a protective effect on the eyes and cornea.[A230133]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Intracellular enzymes subsequently eliminate the HIV particle that previously had been uncoated, and left unprotected, during entry into the host cell.

Resistance: viral genetic determinants resulting in variable response to ribavirin therapy has not been yet determined. ', 'Ribavirin is reported to have several mechanism of actions that lead to inhibition of viral RNA and protein synthesis. 

After activation by adenosine kinase to ribavirin mono-, di-, and triphosphate metabolites. Ribavirin triphosphate (RTP) is the predominant metabolite which directly inhibits viral mRNA polymerase by binding to the nucleotide binding site of the enzyme. This prevents the binding of the correct nucleotides, leading to a reduction in viral replication or to the production of defective virions [A19645]. RTP also demonstrates an inhibitory action on viral mRNA guanylyltransferase and mRNA 2′-O-methyltransferase of dengue virus. Inhibition of these enzymes disrupts the posttranslational capping of the 5′ end of viral mRNA through ribavirin being incorporated at the 5′ end in place of guanosine and preventing the cap methylation step. 



Inhibition of host inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and subsequent depletion of GTP pool is proposed to be another mechanism of action of ribavirin. IMPDH catalyzes the rate-limiting step where inosine 5′-monophosphate is converted to xanthine monophosphate during guanosine monophosphate (GMP) synthesis. GMP is later converted to guanosine triphoshpate (GTP). Ribavirin monophosphate mimics inosine 5′-monophosphate and acts as a competitive inhibitor of IMPDH. Inhibited de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides and decreased intracellular GTP pools leads to a decline in viral protein synthesis and limit replication of viral genomes [A19645].



Ribavirin acts as a mutagen in the target virus to cause an ''error catastrophe'' due to increased viral mutations. RTP pairs with cytidine triphosphate or uridine triphosphate with equal efficiency and to block HCV RNA elongation. It causes premature termination of nascent HCV RNA and increases mutagenesis by producing defective virions [A19645].



Ribavirin also exerts an immunomodulatory action of the host to the virus by shifting a Th2 response in favor of a Th1 phenotype. Th2 response and production of type 2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 stimulates the humoral response which enhances immunity toward the virus [A19645]. Ribavirin enhanced induction of interferon-related genes, including the interferon-α receptor, and down-regulation of genes involved in interferon inhibition, apoptosis, and hepatic stellate cell activation in vitro [A19644]. ', 'Ribavirin mediates direct antiviral activity against a number of DNA and RNA viruses by increasing the mutation frequency in the genomes of several RNA viruses. It is a member of the nucleoside antimetabolite drugs that interfere with duplication of the viral genetic material.

**Important notes regarding Staphylococcus and Sensitivity testing:**



Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains, is the principal Gram-positive organism sensitive to amikacin.

The use of amikacin in the treatment of staphylococcal infections should be restricted only to second-line therapy, and should be limited to only those patients suffering from severe infections caused by susceptible strains of staphylococcus species who have failed to show sensitivity to other available antibiotics.[F1949]

Erythromycin is indicated in the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of various bacteria.[L7261] The indications for erythromycin have been summarized by body system below:



**Respiratory infections**



Mild to moderate upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenzae (when used concomitantly with appropriate doses of sulfonamides) can be treated with erythromycin.[L7261] Mild to moderate lower-respiratory tract infections due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Streptococcus pyogenes may also be treated. Erythromycin treats listeriosis caused by Listeria monocytogenes may also be treated with erythromycin.[L7261]

Erythromycin is indicated to treat pertussis (whooping cough) caused by Bordetella pertussis. It is effective in eliminating the causative organism from the nasopharynx of infected individuals, rendering them noninfectious. Clinical studies suggest that erythromycin may aid in the prevention of pertussis infection for individuals who have been exposed to the bacteria.[L7261] Respiratory tract infections due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae may also be treated with erythromycin.[L7261]  Despite the fact that no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted to this date, in vitro and certain preliminary clinical study results indicate that erythromycin may be an effective treatment in  Legionnaires’ Disease.[L7261] Finally, erythromycin is indicated to treat diphtheria and other infections due to Corynebacterium diphtheriae, as an adjunct to antitoxin, to prevent carrier status and to eradicate the organism in existing carriers.[L7261] In addition to the prevention of diphtheria, erythromycin can be used to prevent rheumatic fever in penicillin intolerant patients.[L7261]

 



**Skin infections**



Mild to moderate skin or skin structure infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus may be treated with erythromycin, however, resistant staphylococcal organisms may emerge.[L7261] Erythromycin can also be used to treat erythrasma, an infectious condition caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum.[L7261]





**Gastrointestinal infections**



Intestinal amebiasis caused by Entamoeba histolytica can be treated with oral erythromycin. Extraenteric amebiasis warrants treatment with other antimicrobial drugs.[L7261]





**Genital infections/STIs**



Erythromycin can be used as an alternative drug in treating acute pelvic inflammatory disease caused by N. gonorrheae in female patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity or intolerance to penicillin.[L7261] Syphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum, can be treated with erythromycin.  It serves as an alternative treatment for primary syphilis in patients who have demonstrated penicillin hypersensitivity. Erythromycin can also be used in the primary stage of primary syphilis.[L7261] Another approved indication of erythromycin is to treat chlamydial infections that cause conjunctivitis of the newborn, pneumonia of infancy, and urogenital infections occurring in pregnancy. It is indicated as an alternative option to tetracyclines for the treatment of uncomplicated rectal, urethral and endocervical infections in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.[L7261] Erythromycin can be used in nongonococcal urethritis can be used when tetracyclines cannot be administered. Finally, erythromycin is indicated to treat nongonococcal urethritis due to Ureaplasma urealyticum.[L7261]

', 'In order to replicate, bacteria require a specific process of protein synthesis, enabled by ribosomal proteins.[A6505] Erythromycin acts by inhibition of protein synthesis by binding to the 23S ribosomal RNA molecule in the 50S subunit of ribosomes in susceptible bacterial organisms.  It stops bacterial protein synthesis by inhibiting the transpeptidation/translocation step of protein synthesis and by inhibiting the assembly of the 50S ribosomal subunit.[L7261,A14179] This results in the control of various bacterial infections.[A174193,L7261] The strong affinity of macrolides, including erythromycin, for bacterial ribosomes, supports their broad‐spectrum antibacterial activities.[A174193]



', 'Macrolides, such as erythromycin, stop bacterial growth by inhibiting protein synthesis and translation, treating bacterial infections.[A174175] Erythromycin does not exert effects on nucleic acid synthesis.[L7261] This drug has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, effectively treating both in vitro and clinical infections. Despite this, it is important to perform bacterial susceptibility testing before administering this antibiotic, as resistance is a common issue that may affect treatment.[L7261] 



**A note on antimicrobial resistance, pseudomembranous colitis, and hepatotoxicity**



Many strains of Haemophilus influenzae are resistant to erythromycin alone but are found to be susceptible to erythromycin and sulfonamides used in combination. It is important to note that Staphylococci that are resistant to erythromycin may emerge during erythromycin and/or sulfonamide therapy.[L7261] Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with most antibacterial agents, including erythromycin, and may range in severity from mild to life-threatening. Therefore, the physician should consider this diagnosis in patients with diarrhea after the administration of antibacterial agents.[L7261] Erythromycin can cause hepatic dysfunction, cholestatic jaundice, and abnormal liver transaminases, particularly when erythromycin estolate is administered.[L7270]

Lower urinary tract symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia are categorized into three main groups: voiding or obstructive (hesitancy, slow stream, intermittency, incomplete emptying), storage or irritative (frequency, urgency, nocturia, urge urinary incontinence), and postmicturition (postvoid dribbling). Prostate contraction is the main contributor to lower urinary tract symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. The smooth muscle tone of the prostate is regulated by α<sub>1A</sub>-adrenoceptors, which are the most highly expressed subtype of α<sub>1</sub>adrenoceptors in the human prostate tissue.[A231159] It has been reported that blockade of α<sub>1A</sub>-adrenoceptors relieves bladder outlet obstruction. Blockade of α<sub>1D</sub>-adrenoceptors, another subtype found in prostate tissue, is believed to alleviate storage symptoms due to detrusor overactivity.[A231229]



α<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors are G protein-coupled receptors: upon binding of its natural ligand, norepinephrine and epinephrine, leads to the activation of phospholipase C and downstream signalling molecules, including inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol. Ultimately, there is an increase in intracellular calcium levels and, consequently, smooth muscle contraction. Silodosin is an antagonist of α<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors, with the highest selectivity for the α<sub>1A</sub>-adrenoceptor subtype. By blocking the α<sub>1A</sub>-adrenoceptor signalling pathway, silodosin promotes prostatic and urethral smooth muscle relaxation, thereby improving lower urinary tract symptoms such as voiding. Silodosin also targets afferent nerves in the bladder, relieving bladder overactivity and storage symptoms.[A231159]', 'Silodosin is an antagonist of α<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors. It has the highest selectivity for the α<sub>1A</sub>-adrenoceptor subtype, with a 162-fold greater affinity than α<sub>1B</sub>-adrenoceptor and about a 50-fold greater affinity than for α<sub>1D</sub>-adrenoceptor. In clinical trials, silodosin improved maximum urinary flow rate, voiding symptoms, and storage symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia.[A231159, A231174] Following oral administration, silodosin had a rapid onset of effect in men,[A231174] with early effects of relieving lower urinary tract symptoms occurring within two to six hours post-dose.[A231229]



Silodosin inhibited the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) tail current; however, it has weak cardiovascular effects.[A231199] As with all α<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor antagonists blocking α<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors in the iris dilator muscle, silodosin may cause intraoperative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS), which is characterized by small pupils and iris billowing during cataract surgery in patients taking α1-AR antagonists.[A231229]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

This binding results in displacement of divalent cations and increased membrane permeability, allowing for aminoglycoside entry.[A232294, A232304, A232309, A232314]

The second “energy-dependent phase I” of aminoglycoside entry into the cytoplasm relies on the proton-motive force and allows a limited amount of aminoglycoside access to its primary intracellular target - the bacterial 30S ribosome.[A232294, A232314] This ultimately results in the mistranslation of proteins and disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane.[A233320] Finally, in the “energy-dependent phase II” stage, concentration-dependent bacterial killing is observed. Aminoglycoside rapidly accumulates in the cell due to the damaged cytoplasmic membrane, and protein mistranslation and synthesis inhibition is amplified.[A232294, A232314, A232319] The necessity of oxygen-dependent active transport explains why aminoglycosides are ineffective against anaerobic bacteria.[A234130]

Hence, aminoglycosides have both immediate bactericidal effects through membrane disruption and delayed bactericidal effects through impaired protein synthesis; observed experimental data and mathematical modeling support this two-mechanism model.[A232294, A232299]

Inhibition of protein synthesis is a key component of aminoglycoside efficacy. Structural and cell biological studies suggest that aminoglycosides bind to the 16S rRNA in helix 44 (h44), near the A site of the 30S ribosomal subunit, altering interactions between h44 and h45. This binding also displaces two important residues, A1492 and A1493, from h44, mimicking normal conformational changes that occur with successful codon-anticodon pairing in the A site.[A232324, A232329] Overall, aminoglycoside binding has several negative effects including inhibition of translation, initiation, elongation, and ribosome recycling.[A232294, A232334, A232339] Recent evidence suggests that the latter effect is due to a cryptic second binding site situated in h69 of the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit.[A232329, A232339] Also, by stabilizing a conformation that mimics correct codon-anticodon pairing, aminoglycosides promote error-prone translation.[A232344] Mistranslated proteins can incorporate into the cell membrane, inducing the damage discussed above.[A232294, A232319]', NULL, 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Mannitol is also indicated as add-on maintenance therapy for improving pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis patients aged 18 and over who have passed the BRONCHITOL tolerance test (BTT). It is recommended that patients take an orally inhaled short-acting bronchodilator 5-15 minutes prior to every inhaled mannitol dose.[L20024]', 'Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that is metabolically inert in humans and occurs naturally, as a sugar or sugar alcohol, in fruits and vegetables. Mannitol elevates blood plasma osmolality, resulting in enhanced flow of water from tissues, including the brain and cerebrospinal fluid, into interstitial fluid and plasma. As a result, cerebral edema, elevated intracranial pressure, and cerebrospinal fluid volume and pressure may be reduced. As a diurectic mannitol induces diuresis because it is not reabsorbed in the renal tubule, thereby increasing the osmolality of the glomerular filtrate, facilitating excretion of water, and inhibiting the renal tubular reabsorption of sodium, chloride, and other solutes. Mannitol promotes the urinary excretion of toxic materials and protects against nephrotoxicity by preventing the concentration of toxic substances in the tubular fluid. As an Antiglaucoma agent mannitol levates blood plasma osmolarity, resulting in enhanced flow of water from the eye into plasma and a consequent reduction in intraocular pressure. As a renal function diagnostic aid mannitol is freely filtered by the glomeruli with less than 10% tubular reabsorption. Therefore, its urinary excretion rate may serve as a measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR).



The exact mechanism of action of inhaled mannitol in the symptomatic maintenance treatment of cystic fibrosis remains unclear.[A223199, L20024] It is hypothesized that mannitol produces an osmotic gradient across the airway epithelium that draws fluid into the extracellular space and alters the properties of the airway surface mucus layer, allowing easier mucociliary clearance.[A223199]', 'Chemically, mannitol is an alcohol and a sugar, or a polyol; it is similar to xylitol or sorbitol. However, mannitol has a tendency to lose a hydrogen ion in aqueous solutions, which causes the solution to become acidic. For this reason, it is not uncommon to add a substance to adjust its pH, such as sodium bicarbonate. Mannitol is commonly used to increase urine production (diuretic). It is also used to treat or prevent medical conditions that are caused by an increase in body fluids/water (e.g., cerebral edema, glaucoma, kidney failure). Mannitol is frequently given along with other diuretics (e.g., furosemide, chlorothiazide) and/or IV fluid replacement.

', '**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].



Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].



In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].



There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].



Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].



The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. 



In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].



In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].



The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].', 'Zinc is involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of human proteins may bind zinc, in addition to hundreds of proteins that transport and traffic zinc. It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is an essential element for a proper sense of taste and smell and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations [L2211].



Studies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions [L2095]:



**Colds:** Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently [L2095].



**Wound healing:** Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements [L2095]. 



**Diahrrea**: Oral zinc supplements can reduce the symptoms of diarrhea in children with low levels of zinc, especially in cases of malnutrition [L2095].

This response is mediated by the release of nitric oxide (NO) from nerve terminals and endothelial cells, which stimulates the synthesis of cyclic GMP in smooth muscle cells. Cyclic GMP causes smooth muscle relaxation and increased blood flow into the corpus cavernosum. The tissue concentration of cyclic GMP is regulated by both the rates of synthesis and degradation via phosphodiesterases (PDEs), and the most abundant PDE in the human corpus cavernosum is PDE5. Therefore, the inhibition of PDE5 by vardenafil enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cyclic GMP.[L45563]', 'Vardenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), an enzyme responsible for the degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum.

• Pathologic hypersecretory conditions in adults', 'Hydrochloric acid (HCl) secretion into the gastric lumen is a process regulated mainly by the H(+)/K(+)-ATPase of the proton pump [A175180], expressed in high quantities by the parietal cells of the stomach. ATPase is an enzyme on the parietal cell membrane that facilitates hydrogen and potassium exchange through the cell, which normally results in the extrusion of potassium and formation of HCl (gastric acid) [A174295].



Omeprazole is a member of a class of antisecretory compounds, the substituted _benzimidazoles_, that stop gastric acid secretion by selective inhibition of the _H+/K+ ATPase_ enzyme system. Proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole bind covalently to cysteine residues via disulfide bridges on the alpha subunit of the _H+/K+ ATPase_ pump, inhibiting gastric acid secretion for up to 36 hours [A175192].  This antisecretory effect is dose-related and leads to the inhibition of both basal and stimulated acid secretion, regardless of the stimulus [FDA label].  



**Mechanism of H. pylori eradication**



Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is frequently associated with _Helicobacter pylori_ bacterial infection (NSAIDs) [A175195]. The treatment of H. pylori infection may include the addition of omeprazole or other proton pump inhibitors as part of the treatment regimen [FDA label], [A175198]. 

_H. pylori_ replicates most effectively at a neutral pH [A175213]. Acid inhibition in H. pylori eradication therapy, including proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole, raises gastric pH, discouraging the growth of H.pylori [A175198]. It is generally believed that proton pump inhibitors inhibit the _urease_ enzyme, which increases the pathogenesis of H. pylori in gastric-acid related conditions [A175216].   ', '**Effects on gastric acid secretion**



This drug decreases gastric acid secretion [FDA label]. After oral administration, the onset of the antisecretory effect of omeprazole is usually achieved within one hour, with the maximum effect occurring by 2 hours after administration. The inhibitory effect of omeprazole on acid secretion increases with repeated once-daily dosing, reaching a plateau after four days [FDA label].



**Effects on serum gastrin**



In studies of 200 or more patients, serum gastrin levels increased during the first 1-2 weeks of daily administration of therapeutic doses of omeprazole. This occurred in a parallel fashion with the inhibition of acid secretion. No further increase in serum gastrin occurred with continued omeprazole administration. Increased gastrin causes enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and increased serum Chromogranin A (CgA) levels. The increased CgA levels may lead to false positive results in diagnostic studies for neuroendocrine tumors [FDA label].



**Enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell effects**



Human gastric biopsy samples have been obtained from more than 3000 pediatric and adult patients treated with omeprazole in long-term clinical studies. The incidence of enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia in these studies increased with time; however, no case of ECL cell carcinoids, dysplasia, or neoplasia have been identified in these patients. These studies, however, are of insufficient in power and duration to draw conclusions on the possible influence of long-term administration of omeprazole in the development of any premalignant or malignant conditions [FDA label]. 



**Other effects**



Systemic effects of omeprazole in the central nervous system, cardiovascular and respiratory systems have not been found to date. Omeprazole, given in oral doses of 30 or 40 mg for 2-4 weeks, showed no effect on thyroid function, carbohydrate metabolism, or circulating levels of parathyroid hormone, cortisol, estradiol, testosterone, prolactin, cholecystokinin or secretin [FDA label].

Indicated for off-label uses in anal fissures (as topical formulation), migraine prophylaxis, cramps in lower leg related to rest, pulmonary hypertension,[L6289] idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, and proteinuria associated with diabetic nephropathy.[L6298]', 'Excitation of cardiac muscle involves the activation of a slow calcium inward current that is induced by L-type slow calcium channels, which are voltage-sensitive, ion-selective channels[A178444] associated with a high activation threshold and slow inactivation profile.[T28] L-type calcium channels are the main current responsible for the late phase of the pacemaker potential.[A178492] Acting as the main Ca2+ source for contraction in smooth and cardiac muscle, activation of L-type calcium channels allows the influx of calcium ions into the muscles upon depolarization and excitation of the channel.[A178444] It is proposed that this cation influx may also trigger the release of additional calcium ions from intracellular storage sites.[A178444] Diltiazem is a slow calcium channel blocker that binds to the extracellular site of the alpha-1C subunit of the channel, which is thought to be the S5-6 linker region of the transmembrane domain IV and/or S6 segment of domain III.[A178492]  Diltiazem can get access to this binding site from either the intracellular or extracellular side, but it requires a voltage-induced conformational changes in the membrane.[A178492] Diltiazem inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes.[L10556] In isolated human atrial and ventricular myocardium, diltiazem suppressed tension over the range of membrane potentials associated with calcium channel activity but had little effect on the tension-voltage relations at more positive potentials.[A178453] This effect is thought to be mediated by the voltage-dependent block of the L-type calcium channels and inhibition of calcium ion release from the ER stores, without altering the sodium-calcium coupled transport or calcium sensitivity of myofilaments.[A178453] Through inhibition of inward calcium current, diltiazem exerts a direct ionotropic and energy sparing effect on the myocardium.[A178444] Diltiazem fslows atrioventricular nodal conduction, which is due to its ability to impede slow channel function.[A178444]



Reduced intracellular calcium concentrations equate to increased smooth muscle relaxation resulting in arterial vasodilation and therefore, decreased blood pressure.[L6289] The decrease in intracellular calcium inhibits the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells, causing dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, increased oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased systemic blood pressure, and decreased afterload.[L6289,L10556] Through its actions on reducing calcium levels in cardiac and vascular smooth muscles, diltiazem causes a reduction in the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells and vasodilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, including epicardial and subendocardial. This subsequently leads to increased oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, improved cardiac output due to increased stroke volume, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased systemic blood pressure and heart rate, and decreased afterload.[L6289,L10556] Diltiazem lowers myocardial oxygen demand through a reduction in heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac contractility; this leads to a therapeutic effect in improving exercise tolerance in chronic stable angina.[A178432,L6289] ', 'Diltiazem is an antihypertensive and vasodilating agent that works by relaxing the vascular muscle and reducing blood pressure. This is related to the long-term therapeutic effects, as lowering the blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions.[L10556] Diltiazem inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium ions across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes during depolarization. Diltiazem is classified as a negative inotrope (decreased force) and negative chronotrope (decreased rate).[L6289] It is also considered a rate-control drug as it reduces heart rate.[A178432,T28] Diltiazem is exerts hemodynamic actions by reducing blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance, the rate-pressure product, and coronary vascular resistance while increasing coronary blood flow.[L6292] Diltiazem decreases sinoatrial and atrioventricular conduction in isolated tissues and has a negative inotropic effect in isolated preparations.[L10556] In supraventricular tachycardia, diltiazem prolongs AV nodal refractories.[L6292]



As the magnitude of blood pressure reduction is related to the degree of hypertension, the antihypertensive effect of diltiazem is most pronounced in individuals with hypertension. In a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, dose-response study involving patients with essential hypertension, there was a reduction in the diastolic blood pressure by 1.9, 5.4, 6.1, and 8.6 mmHg in the patients receiving diltiazem at doses of 120, 240, 360, and 540 mg, respectively. In patients receiving placebo, there was a reduction in the diastolic blood pressure by 2.6 mmHg.In a randomized, double-blind study involving patients with chronic stable angina, variable doses of diltiazem administered at night all caused an increased exercise tolerance in the after 21 hours, compared to placebo.[L10556] In the NORDIL study of patients with hypertension, the therapeutic effectiveness of diltiazem in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality was assessed.[A178432] When using the combined primary endpoint as fatal and non-fatal stroke, myocardial infarction, and other cardiovascular death, fatal and non-fatal stroke was shown to be reduced by 25% in the diltiazem group.

The rate of removal of phosphate by dietary manipulation or by dialysis is insufficient. Dialysis patients absorb 40% to 80% of dietary phosphorus. Therefore, the fraction of dietary phosphate absorbed from the diet needs to be reduced by using phosphate binders in most renal failure patients on maintenance dialysis.

Cytarabine is cytotoxic to a wide variety of proliferating mammalian cells in culture.

Although the mechanism of action is not completely understood, it appears that cytarabine acts through the inhibition of DNA polymerase. A limited, but significant, incorporation of cytarabine into both DNA and RNA has also been reported.', 'Cytarabine is an antineoplastic anti-metabolite used in the treatment of several forms of leukemia including acute myelogenous leukemia and meningeal leukemia. Anti-metabolites masquerade as purine or pyrimidine - which become the building blocks of DNA. They prevent these substances becoming incorporated in to DNA during the "S" phase (of the cell cycle), stopping normal development and division. Cytarabine is metabolized intracellularly into its active triphosphate form (cytosine arabinoside triphosphate). This metabolite then damages DNA by multiple mechanisms, including the inhibition of alpha-DNA polymerase, inhibition of DNA repair through an effect on beta-DNA polymerase, and incorporation into DNA. The latter mechanism is probably the most important. Cytotoxicity is highly specific for the S phase of the cell cycle.', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

The organisms susceptible to cefdinir have been listed below in addition to their associated clinical condition that may be treated with cefdinir.[L7330] Various beta-lactamase producing organisms may be treated, as indicated in certain sections below.

**Skin and skin structure infections**



Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes', 'Five-member thiazolidine rings that make up penicillins are replaced in cephalosporins by a six-member dihydrothiazine ring, conferring greater bactericidal activity. This This 6-member ring enables cefdinir and other cephalosporins to resist inactivation by certain bacterial enzymes.[A180772]



With a mechanism similar to other beta-lactam antibiotics, the bactericidal activity of cefdinir is caused by the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Cefdinir, like other cephalosporins, penetrates the bacterial cell wall, combats inactivation by beta-lactamase enzymes, and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins.[A180772] This interferes with the final step of transpeptidation in cell walls, eventually leading to cell lysis, which eventually leads to the death of bacteria that are susceptible to this drug.[A180724] Cefdinir has shown affinity to penicillin protein binding proteins 2 and 3. [A15746,A180760,A15747] It has also been shown to inhibit transpeptidase enzymes of various bacteria, which may play a role in its bactericidal action.[A180766,A180769] One in vitro study suggests that cefdinir inhibits myeloperoxidase release extracellularly.[A11897] The impact of this potential drug target in relation to its mechanism of action is unknown.', 'Cefdinir is a bactericidal agent that treats bacterial infections by interfering with cell wall synthesis.[L7330]

Cefdinir exerts broad-spectrum activity against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections. It is effective against several beta-lactamase enzyme producing bacteria.

Mannitol is also indicated as add-on maintenance therapy for improving pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis patients aged 18 and over who have passed the BRONCHITOL tolerance test (BTT). It is recommended that patients take an orally inhaled short-acting bronchodilator 5-15 minutes prior to every inhaled mannitol dose.[L20024]', 'Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that is metabolically inert in humans and occurs naturally, as a sugar or sugar alcohol, in fruits and vegetables. Mannitol elevates blood plasma osmolality, resulting in enhanced flow of water from tissues, including the brain and cerebrospinal fluid, into interstitial fluid and plasma. As a result, cerebral edema, elevated intracranial pressure, and cerebrospinal fluid volume and pressure may be reduced. As a diurectic mannitol induces diuresis because it is not reabsorbed in the renal tubule, thereby increasing the osmolality of the glomerular filtrate, facilitating excretion of water, and inhibiting the renal tubular reabsorption of sodium, chloride, and other solutes. Mannitol promotes the urinary excretion of toxic materials and protects against nephrotoxicity by preventing the concentration of toxic substances in the tubular fluid. As an Antiglaucoma agent mannitol levates blood plasma osmolarity, resulting in enhanced flow of water from the eye into plasma and a consequent reduction in intraocular pressure. As a renal function diagnostic aid mannitol is freely filtered by the glomeruli with less than 10% tubular reabsorption. Therefore, its urinary excretion rate may serve as a measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR).



The exact mechanism of action of inhaled mannitol in the symptomatic maintenance treatment of cystic fibrosis remains unclear.[A223199, L20024] It is hypothesized that mannitol produces an osmotic gradient across the airway epithelium that draws fluid into the extracellular space and alters the properties of the airway surface mucus layer, allowing easier mucociliary clearance.[A223199]', 'Chemically, mannitol is an alcohol and a sugar, or a polyol; it is similar to xylitol or sorbitol. However, mannitol has a tendency to lose a hydrogen ion in aqueous solutions, which causes the solution to become acidic. For this reason, it is not uncommon to add a substance to adjust its pH, such as sodium bicarbonate. Mannitol is commonly used to increase urine production (diuretic). It is also used to treat or prevent medical conditions that are caused by an increase in body fluids/water (e.g., cerebral edema, glaucoma, kidney failure). Mannitol is frequently given along with other diuretics (e.g., furosemide, chlorothiazide) and/or IV fluid replacement.

• Pathologic hypersecretory conditions in adults', 'Hydrochloric acid (HCl) secretion into the gastric lumen is a process regulated mainly by the H(+)/K(+)-ATPase of the proton pump [A175180], expressed in high quantities by the parietal cells of the stomach. ATPase is an enzyme on the parietal cell membrane that facilitates hydrogen and potassium exchange through the cell, which normally results in the extrusion of potassium and formation of HCl (gastric acid) [A174295].



Omeprazole is a member of a class of antisecretory compounds, the substituted _benzimidazoles_, that stop gastric acid secretion by selective inhibition of the _H+/K+ ATPase_ enzyme system. Proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole bind covalently to cysteine residues via disulfide bridges on the alpha subunit of the _H+/K+ ATPase_ pump, inhibiting gastric acid secretion for up to 36 hours [A175192].  This antisecretory effect is dose-related and leads to the inhibition of both basal and stimulated acid secretion, regardless of the stimulus [FDA label].  



**Mechanism of H. pylori eradication**



Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is frequently associated with _Helicobacter pylori_ bacterial infection (NSAIDs) [A175195]. The treatment of H. pylori infection may include the addition of omeprazole or other proton pump inhibitors as part of the treatment regimen [FDA label], [A175198]. 

_H. pylori_ replicates most effectively at a neutral pH [A175213]. Acid inhibition in H. pylori eradication therapy, including proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole, raises gastric pH, discouraging the growth of H.pylori [A175198]. It is generally believed that proton pump inhibitors inhibit the _urease_ enzyme, which increases the pathogenesis of H. pylori in gastric-acid related conditions [A175216].   ', '**Effects on gastric acid secretion**



This drug decreases gastric acid secretion [FDA label]. After oral administration, the onset of the antisecretory effect of omeprazole is usually achieved within one hour, with the maximum effect occurring by 2 hours after administration. The inhibitory effect of omeprazole on acid secretion increases with repeated once-daily dosing, reaching a plateau after four days [FDA label].



**Effects on serum gastrin**



In studies of 200 or more patients, serum gastrin levels increased during the first 1-2 weeks of daily administration of therapeutic doses of omeprazole. This occurred in a parallel fashion with the inhibition of acid secretion. No further increase in serum gastrin occurred with continued omeprazole administration. Increased gastrin causes enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and increased serum Chromogranin A (CgA) levels. The increased CgA levels may lead to false positive results in diagnostic studies for neuroendocrine tumors [FDA label].



**Enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell effects**



Human gastric biopsy samples have been obtained from more than 3000 pediatric and adult patients treated with omeprazole in long-term clinical studies. The incidence of enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia in these studies increased with time; however, no case of ECL cell carcinoids, dysplasia, or neoplasia have been identified in these patients. These studies, however, are of insufficient in power and duration to draw conclusions on the possible influence of long-term administration of omeprazole in the development of any premalignant or malignant conditions [FDA label]. 



**Other effects**



Systemic effects of omeprazole in the central nervous system, cardiovascular and respiratory systems have not been found to date. Omeprazole, given in oral doses of 30 or 40 mg for 2-4 weeks, showed no effect on thyroid function, carbohydrate metabolism, or circulating levels of parathyroid hormone, cortisol, estradiol, testosterone, prolactin, cholecystokinin or secretin [FDA label].

1) Secondary prevention of stroke and transient ischemic attacks in patients with rheumatic mitral valve disease but without atrial fibrillation.[A179182]', 'Warfarin is a [vitamin K] antagonist which acts to inhibit the production of vitamin K by vitamin K epoxide reductase.[label,A179221,T116] The reduced form of vitamin K, vitamin KH<sub>2</sub> is a cofactor used in the γ-carboxylation of coagulation factors VII, IX, X, and thrombin. Carboxylation induces a conformational change allowing the factors to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> and to phospholipid surfaces. Uncarboxylated factors VII, IX, X, and thrombin are biologically inactive and therefore serve to interrupt the coagulation cascade. The endogenous anticoagulation proteins C and S also require  γ-carboxylation to function. This is particularly true in the case of thrombin which must be activated in order to form a thrombus. vitamin KH<sub>2</sub> is converted to vitamin K epoxide as part of the γ-carboxylation reaction catalyzed by γ-glutamyl carboxylase. Vitamin K epoxide is then converted to vitamin K<sub>1</sub> by vitamin K epoxide reductase then back to vitamin KH<sub>2</sub> by vitamin K reductase. Warfarin binds to vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 and irreversibly inhibits the enzyme thereby stopping the recycling of vitamin K by preventing the conversion of vitamin K epoxide to vitamin K<sub>1</sub>. This process creates a hypercoagulable state for a short time as proteins C and S degrade first with half lives of 8 and 24 hours, with the exception of factor VII which has a half life of 6 hours.[A179221] Factors IX, X, and finally thrombin degrade later with half lives of 24, 36, and 50 hours resulting in a dominant anticoagulation effect.[A179221] In order to reverse this anticoagulation vitamin K must be supplied, either exogenously or by removal of the vitamin K epoxide reductase inhibition, and time allowed for new coagulation factors to be synthesized.[label,A179221,T116] It takes approximately 2 days for new coagulation factors to be synthesized in the liver. Vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, functionally identical to vitamin K<sub>1</sub>, is synthesized by gut bacteria leading to interactions with antibiotics as elimination of these bacteria can reduce vitamin K<sub>2</sub supply and result in a greater anticoagulation effect.[T116]', 'Warfarin is an anticoagulant, as such it disrupts the coagulation cascade to reduce frequency and extent of thrombus formation.[label,L6616] In patients with deep vein thrombosis or atrial fibrillation there is an increased risk of thrombus formation due to the reduced movement of blood.[T622] For patients with cardiac valve disease or valve replacements this increased coagulability is due to tissue damage. Thrombi due to venous thrombosis can travel to the lungs and become pulmonary emboli, blocking circulation to a portion of lung tissue. Thrombi which form in the heart can travel to the brain and cause ischemic strokes. Prevention of these events is the primary goal of warfarin therapy.



Limitation of thrombus formation is also a source of adverse effects. In patients with atheroscelotic plaques rupture typically results in thrombus formation.[A179212] When these patients are anticoagulated plaque rupture can allow the escape of cholesterol from the lipid core in the form of atheroemboli or cholesterol microemboli. These emboli are smaller than thrombi and block smaller vessels, usually less than 200 μm in diameter. The consequences of this are varied and depend on the location of the blockage. Effects include visual disturbances, acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease, central nervous system ischemia, and purple or blue toe syndrome.[label,A179212] Blue toe syndrome can be reversed if it has not progressed to tissue necrosis but the other effects of microemboli are often permanent.



Antocoagulation appears to mediate warfarin-related nephropathy, a seemingly spontaneous kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease associated with warfarin therapy.[A179215] Nephropathy in this case appears to be due to increased passage of red blood cells through the glomerulus and subsequent blockage of renal tubules with red blood cell casts. This is worsened or possibly triggered by pre-existing kidney damage. Increased risk of warfarin-related nephropathy occurs at INRs over 3.0 but risk does not increase as a function of INR beyond this point.



Warfarin has been linked to the development of calciphylaxis.[label] This is thought to be due to warfarin''s inhibition of [vitamin K](VKA) recycling as VKA is needed for the carboxylation of matrix Gla protein.[A179218] This protein is an anti-calcification factor and its inhibition through preventing the carboxylation step in its production leads to a shift in calcification balance in favor of calciphylaxis. 



Tissue necrosis can occur early on in warfarin therapy.[label] This is attributable to half lives of the clotting factors impacted by inhibition of vitamin K recycling.[label,A179221] Proteins C and S are anticoagulation factors with half lives of 8 and 24 hours respectively. The coagulation factors IX, X, VII, and thrombin (factor II) have half lives of 24, 36, 6, and 50 hours respectively. This means proteins C and S are inactivated sooner than pro-coagulation proteins, with the exception of factor VII, resulting in a pro-thrombotic state for the first few days of therapy. Thrombi which form in this time period can occlude arterioles in various locations, blocking blood flow and causing tissue necrosis due to ischemia.', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

It is also utilized for boosting the immune system, treating the common cold and recurrent ear infections, as well as preventing lower respiratory tract infections [L2172].  



', '**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].



Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].



In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].



There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].



Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].



The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. 



In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].



In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].



The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].', 'Zinc is involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of human proteins may bind zinc, in addition to hundreds of proteins that transport and traffic zinc. It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is an essential element for a proper sense of taste and smell and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations [L2211].



Studies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions [L2095]:



**Colds:** Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently [L2095].



**Wound healing:** Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements [L2095]. 



**Diahrrea**: Oral zinc supplements can reduce the symptoms of diarrhea in children with low levels of zinc, especially in cases of malnutrition [L2095].

Candesartan confers blood pressure lowering effects by antagonizing the hypertensive effects of angiotensin II via the RAAS. RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. Renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is cleaved by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II increases blood pressure by increasing total peripheral resistance, increasing sodium and water reabsorption in the kidneys via aldosterone secretion, and altering cardiovascular structure. Angiotensin II binds to two receptors: type-1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1) and type-2 angiotensin II receptor (AT2). AT1 is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that mediates the vasoconstrictive and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II. Studies performed in recent years suggest that AT2 antagonizes AT1-mediated effects and directly affects long-term blood pressure control by inducing vasorelaxation and increasing urinary sodium excretion. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are non-peptide competitive inhibitors of AT1. ARBs block the ability of angiotensin II to stimulate pressor and cell proliferative effects.

PGE<sub>2</sub> is the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.[A179023] It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.[T116,A179023] PGE<sub>2</sub> activates the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled EP<sub>1</sub> receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE<sub>2</sub> also activates the EP<sub>4</sub> receptor, coupled to G<sub>s</sub>, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE<sub>2</sub> act via EP<sub>3</sub> to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP<sub>2</sub> to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI<sub>2</sub> is known to play a role via its G<sub>s</sub>-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.



PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP<sub>2</sub> receptors.[T116,A179044] Similarly to β adrenergic receptors these are G<sub>s</sub>-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE<sub>2</sub> also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.[T116] PGD<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP<sub>1</sub> receptor.[A179044] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.



PGE<sub>2</sub> can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory G<sub>q</sub> EP<sub>3</sub> receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.[T116] This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever. NSAIDs prevent the generation of PGE<sub>2</sub> thereby reducing the activity of these neurons.

Such interaction has been reported in a study that investigated the effects of neuronal outgrowth induced by beta amyloid peptides; while amyloid peptides cause lipid disorganization within the cell membranes leading to neuronal death, piracetam demonstrated to decrease the destabilizing effects of amyloid peptide [A31534]. The authors suggest that piracetam induces a positive curvature of the membrane by occupying the polar groups in the phospholipids to counteract the negative curvature induced by amyloid peptides , which in turn would decrease the likelihood of membrane fusion [A31532]. This mechanism of action is thought to improve membrane stability, allowing the membrane and transmembrane proteins to maintain and recover the three-dimensional structure or folding for normal function [L1124] such as membrane transport, chemical secretion, and receptor binding and stimulation [A31532]. 



Through restored membrane fluidity, piracetam promotes restored neurotransmission such as glutamatergic and cholinergic systems, enhances neuroplasticity and mediates neuroprotective and anticonvulsant effects at the neuronal level [A31532]. It is also demonstrated that piracetam also improves the fluidity of platelet membranes. At the vascular level, piracetam decreases adhesion of erythrocytes to cell wall and reduces vasospasm which in turn improves microcirculation including cerebral and renal blood flow [A31532]. ', 'Piracetam is known to mediate various pharmacodynamic actions:



**Neuronal effects**: 



Piracetam modulates the cholinergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic, and glutamatergic neurotransmission although the drug does not display high affinity to any of the associated receptors (Ki >10μM). Instead, piracetam increases the density of postsynaptic receptors and/or restore the function of these receptors through stabilizing the membrane fluidity [A31532]. In the forebrain of aging mice, the density of NMDA receptors was increased by approximately 20% following 14 days of piracetam treatment. Based on the findings of various animal and human studies, the cognitive processses including learning, memory, attention and consciousness were enhanced from piracetam therapy without inducing sedation and psychostimulant effects [L1125]. Piracetam mediate neuroprotective effects against hypoxia-induced damage, intoxication, and electroconvulsive therapy [L1125]. 



In two studies involving alcohol-treated rats with evidences of withdrawal-related neuronal loss, piracetam was shown to reduce the extent of neuronal loss and increase the numbers of synapses in the hippocampus by up to 20% relative to alcohol-treated or alcohol-withdrawn rats [A31532]. This suggests that piracetam is capable in promoting neuroplasticity when recoverable neural circuits are present [A31532]. Although the mechanism of action is not fully understood, administration of piracetam prior to a convulsant stimulus reduces the seizure severity and enhances the anticonvulsant effectiveness of conventional antiepileptics such as carbamazepine and diazepam [A31535]. 



**Vascular effects**: 



Piracetam is shown to increase the deformability of erythrocytes, reduce platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent manner, reduce the adhesion of erythrocytes to vascular endothelium and capillary vasospasm. In healthy volunteers, piracetam mediated a direct stimulant effect on prostacycline synthesis and reduced the plasma levels of fibrinogen and von Willebrand’s factors (VIII: C; VIII R: AG; VIII R: vW) by 30 to 40% [L1125].

Concurrently, as one of the most commonly utilized forms of vitamin D, cholecalciferol is also very frequently used as a supplement in individuals to maintain sufficient vitamin d levels in the body or to treat vitamin D deficiency, as well as various medical conditions that can be associated directly or indirectly with vitamin d insufficiency like osteoporosis and chronic kidney disease, among others [A176041, A176044, F4051].', 'Most individuals naturally generate adequate amounts of vitamin D through ordinary dietary intake of vitamin D (in some foods like eggs, fish, and cheese) and natural photochemical conversion of the vitamin D3 precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin via exposure to sunlight [L5689, F4027, F4042, F4048].



Conversely, vitamin D deficiency can often occur from a combination of insufficient exposure to sunlight, inadequate dietary intake of vitamin D, genetic defects with endogenous vitamin D receptor, or even severe liver or kidney disease [A243]. Such deficiency is known for resulting in conditions like rickets or osteomalacia, all of which reflect inadequate mineralization of bone, enhanced compensatory skeletal demineralization, resultant decreased calcium ion blood concentrations, and increases in the production and secretion of parathyroid hormone [A223]. Increases in parathyroid hormone stimulate the mobilization of skeletal calcium and the renal excretion of phosphorus [A223]. This enhanced mobilization of skeletal calcium leads towards porotic bone conditions [A223].



Ordinarily, while vitamin D3 is made naturally via photochemical processes in the skin, both itself and vitamin D2 can be found in various food and pharmaceutical sources as dietary supplements. The principal biological function of vitamin D is the maintenance of normal levels of serum calcium and phosphorus in the bloodstream by enhancing the efficacy of the small intestine to absorb these minerals from the diet [A223]. At the liver, vitamin D3 or D2 is hydroxylated to 25-hydroxyvitamin D and then finally to the primary active metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in the kidney via further hydroxylation [A223, A243]. This final metabolite binds to endogenous vitamin d receptors, which results in a variety of regulatory roles - including maintaining  calcium balance, the regulation of parathyroid hormone, the promotion of the renal reabsorption of calcium, increased intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus, and increased calcium and phosphorus mobilization of calcium and phosphorus from bone to plasma to maintain balanced levels of each in bone and the plasma [A223, A243].



In particular, calcitriol interacts with vitamin D receptors in the small intestine to enhance the efficiency of intestinal calcium and phosphorous absorption from about 10-15% to 30-40% and 60% increased to 80%, respectively [L5689]. Furthermore, calcitriol binds with vitamin D receptors in osteoblasts to stimulate a receptor activator of nuclear factor kB ligand (or RANKL) which subsequently interacts with receptor activator of nuclear factor kB (NFkB) on immature preosteoclasts, causing them to become mature bone-resorbing osteoclasts [L5689]. Such mature osteoclasts ultimately function in removing calcium and phosphorus from bone to maintain blood calcium and phosphorus levels [L5689]. Moreover, calcitriol also stimulates calcium reabsorption from the glomerular filtrate in the kidneys [L5689].



Additionally, it is believed that when calcitriol binds with nuclear vitamin D receptors, that this bound complex itself binds to retinoic acid X receptor (RXR) to generate a heterodimeric complex that consequently binds to specific nucleotide sequences in the DNA called vitamin D response elements [L5689]. When bound, various transcription factors attach to this complex, resulting in either up or down-regulation of the associated gene''s activity. It is thought that there may be as much as 200 to 2000 genes that possess vitamin D response elements or that are influenced indirectly to control a multitude of genes across the genome [L5689].  It is in this way that cholecalciferol is believed to function in regulating gene transcription associated with cancer risk, autoimmune disorders, and cardiovascular disease linked to vitamin D deficiency [L5689]. In fact, there has been some research to suggest calcitriol may also be able to prevent malignancies by inducing cellular maturation and inducing apoptosis and inhibiting angiogenesis, exhibit anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting foam cell formation and promoting angiogenesis in endothelial colony-forming cells in vitro, inhibit immune reactions by enhancing the transcription of endogenous antibiotics like cathelicidin and regulate the activity and differentiation of CD4+ T cells, amongst a variety of other proposed actions [L5689].   ', 'The in vivo synthesis of the predominant two biologically active metabolites of vitamin D occurs in two steps. The first hydroxylation of vitamin D3 cholecalciferol (or D2) occurs in the liver to yield 25-hydroxyvitamin D while the second hydroxylation happens in the kidneys to give 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D [F4027, F4042, F4048]. These vitamin D metabolites subsequently facilitate the active absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the small intestine, serving to increase serum calcium and phosphate levels sufficiently to allow bone mineralization [F4027, F4042, F4048]. Conversely, these vitamin D metabolites also assist in mobilizing calcium and phosphate from bone and likely increase the reabsorption of calcium and perhaps also of phosphate via the renal tubules [F4027, F4042, F4048].

Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), in the regular tablet form (immediate-release), is indicated to relieve pain, fever, and inflammation associated with many conditions, including the flu, the common cold, neck and back pain, dysmenorrhea, headache, tooth pain, sprains, fractures, myositis, neuralgia, synovitis, arthritis, bursitis, burns, and various injuries. It is also used for symptomatic pain relief after surgical and dental procedures [FDA label]. 



The _extra strength_ formulation of acetylsalicylic acid is also indicated for the management migraine pain with photophobia (sensitivity to light) and phonophobia (sensitivity to sound)[FDA label].



**Other indications**



ASA is also indicated for various other purposes, due to its ability to inhibit platelet aggregation. These include: 



Reducing the risk of cardiovascular death in suspected cases of myocardial infarction (MI) [FDA label]. 



Reducing the risk of a first non-fatal myocardial infarction in patients, and for reducing the risk of morbidity and mortality in cases of unstable angina and in those who have had a prior myocardial infarction [FDA label].



For reducing the risk of transient ischemic attacks (TIA) and to prevent atherothrombotic cerebral infarction (in conjunction with other treatments) [FDA label].



For the prevention of thromboembolism after hip replacement surgery [FDA label]. 



For decreasing platelet to platelet adhesion following carotid endarterectomy, aiding in the prevention of transient ischemic attacks (TIA) [FDA label].



Used for patients undergoing hemodialysis with a silicone rubber arteriovenous cannula inserted to prevent thrombosis at the insertion site [FDA Label]. 



**Important note regarding use of the extended-release formulation [F4405]**



In the setting of acute myocardial infarction, or before percutaneous interventions, the extended-release form of acetylsalicylic acid should not be used. Use immediate-release formulations in scenarios requiring rapid onset of action [Label, F4405]. The extended-release form is taken to decrease the incidence of mortality and myocardial infarction (MI) for individuals diagnosed with chronic coronary artery disease (CAD), including patients with previous myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina or with chronic stable angina. Additionally, the extended-release form is used to decrease the risk of death and recurrent episodes of stroke in patients with a history of stroke or TIA [F4405].





 ', 'Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) blocks prostaglandin synthesis. It is non-selective for COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes [A177241, A10989, A32682]. Inhibition of COX-1 results in the inhibition of platelet aggregation for about 7-10 days (average platelet lifespan). The acetyl group of acetylsalicylic acid binds with a serine residue of the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) enzyme, leading to irreversible inhibition. This prevents the production of pain-causing prostaglandins. This process also stops the conversion of arachidonic acid to thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which is a potent inducer of platelet aggregation [FDA label].  Platelet aggregation can result in clots and harmful venous and arterial thromboembolism, leading to conditions such as pulmonary embolism and stroke. 



It is important to note that there is 60% homology between the protein structures of COX-1 and COX-2. ASA binds to serine 516 residue on the active site of COX-2 in the same fashion as its binding to the serine 530 residue located on the active site of COX-1. The active site of COX-2 is, however, slightly larger than the active site of COX-1, so that arachidonic acid (which later becomes prostaglandins) manages to bypass the aspirin molecule inactivating COX-2 [A32682, A177256].  ASA, therefore, exerts more action on the COX-1 receptor rather than on the COX-2 receptor [A177268]. A higher dose of acetylsalicylic acid is required for COX-2 inhibition [A177325]. ', '**Effects on pain and fever**



Acetylsalicylic acid disrupts the production of prostaglandins throughout the body by targeting cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) [A177241, A10989, A32682]. Prostaglandins are potent, irritating substances that have been shown to cause headaches and pain upon injection into humans.  Prostaglandins increase the sensitivity of pain receptors and substances such as histamine and bradykinin. Through the disruption of the production and prevention of release of prostaglandins in inflammation, this drug may stop their action at pain receptors, preventing symptoms of pain. Acetylsalicylic acid is considered an antipyretic agent because of its ability to interfere with the production of brain prostaglandin E1. Prostaglandin E1 is known to be an extremely powerful fever-inducing agent [FDA label]. 



**Effects on platelet aggregation**



The inhibition of platelet aggregation by ASA occurs because of its interference with thromboxane A2 in platelets, caused by COX-1 inhibition. Thromboxane A2 is an important lipid responsible for platelet aggregation, which can lead to clot formation and future risk of heart attack or stroke  [FDA label]. 



**A note on cancer prevention**



ASA has been studied in recent years to determine its effect on the prevention of various malignancies [A177325]. In general, acetylsalicylic acid is involved in the interference of various cancer signaling pathways, sometimes inducing or upregulating tumor suppressor genes [A177325, A177403]. Results of various studies suggest that there are beneficial effects of long-term ASA use in the prevention of several types of cancer, including stomach, colorectal, pancreatic, and liver cancers [A177400].

Mannitol is also indicated as add-on maintenance therapy for improving pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis patients aged 18 and over who have passed the BRONCHITOL tolerance test (BTT). It is recommended that patients take an orally inhaled short-acting bronchodilator 5-15 minutes prior to every inhaled mannitol dose.[L20024]', 'Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that is metabolically inert in humans and occurs naturally, as a sugar or sugar alcohol, in fruits and vegetables. Mannitol elevates blood plasma osmolality, resulting in enhanced flow of water from tissues, including the brain and cerebrospinal fluid, into interstitial fluid and plasma. As a result, cerebral edema, elevated intracranial pressure, and cerebrospinal fluid volume and pressure may be reduced. As a diurectic mannitol induces diuresis because it is not reabsorbed in the renal tubule, thereby increasing the osmolality of the glomerular filtrate, facilitating excretion of water, and inhibiting the renal tubular reabsorption of sodium, chloride, and other solutes. Mannitol promotes the urinary excretion of toxic materials and protects against nephrotoxicity by preventing the concentration of toxic substances in the tubular fluid. As an Antiglaucoma agent mannitol levates blood plasma osmolarity, resulting in enhanced flow of water from the eye into plasma and a consequent reduction in intraocular pressure. As a renal function diagnostic aid mannitol is freely filtered by the glomeruli with less than 10% tubular reabsorption. Therefore, its urinary excretion rate may serve as a measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR).



The exact mechanism of action of inhaled mannitol in the symptomatic maintenance treatment of cystic fibrosis remains unclear.[A223199, L20024] It is hypothesized that mannitol produces an osmotic gradient across the airway epithelium that draws fluid into the extracellular space and alters the properties of the airway surface mucus layer, allowing easier mucociliary clearance.[A223199]', 'Chemically, mannitol is an alcohol and a sugar, or a polyol; it is similar to xylitol or sorbitol. However, mannitol has a tendency to lose a hydrogen ion in aqueous solutions, which causes the solution to become acidic. For this reason, it is not uncommon to add a substance to adjust its pH, such as sodium bicarbonate. Mannitol is commonly used to increase urine production (diuretic). It is also used to treat or prevent medical conditions that are caused by an increase in body fluids/water (e.g., cerebral edema, glaucoma, kidney failure). Mannitol is frequently given along with other diuretics (e.g., furosemide, chlorothiazide) and/or IV fluid replacement.

Furthermore, some formulations like chewable montelukast tablets may also be specifically indicated by particular regulatory bodies for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma, including the prevention of day and night-time symptoms, the treatment of acetylsalicylic acid based asthma, and the prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in adult and pediatric patients aged 2 and older[L6328], between the ages 2 and 5[L6325], or between the ages of 6 and 14 years.[L6331]



Moreover, when employed for such indications montelukast is considered effective as monotherapy or when combined with other medications indicated for the maintenance treatment of chronic asthma.[L6304,L6328] For instance, montelukast and inhaled corticosteroids can be used concomitantly to demonstrate additive effects to control asthma or to decrease the necessary inhaled corticosteroid dose while still maintaining clinical stability.[L6304,L6328]



Additionally, in patients who continue to experience asthma symptoms, montelukast can also be combined with an ''as required'' short-acting beta-agonist, an inhaled corticosteroid, or inhaled corticosteroid paired with a long-acting beta-agonist.[L6304,L6328]', 'Cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLT) like LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4, among others, are eicosanoids released by a variety of cells like mast cells and eosinophils.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] When such CysLT bind to corresponding CysLT receptors like CysLT type-1 receptors located on respiratory airway smooth muscle cells, airway macrophages, and on various pro-inflammatory cells like eosinophils and some specific myeloid stem cells activities that facilitate the pathophysiology of asthma and allergic rhinitis are stimulated.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]



In particular, CysLT-mediated airway bronchoconstriction, occluding mucous secretion, vascular permeability, and eosinophil recruitment are all types of effects that facilitate asthma.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Alternatively, in allergic rhinitis, CysLTs are released by the nasal mucosa when exposed to allergens during both early and late phase reactions and participate in eliciting symptoms of allergic rhinitis like a congested nose and airway.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]



Subsequently, montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that binds with high affinity and selectivity to the CysLT type 1 receptor, which consequently assists in inhibiting any physiological actions of CysLTs like LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 at the receptor that may facilitate asthma or allergic rhinitis.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]', 'Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that demonstrates a marked affinity and selectivity to the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor type-1 in preference to many other crucial airway receptors like the prostanoid, cholinergic, or beta-adrenergic receptors.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] As a consequence, the agent can elicit substantial blockage of LTD4 leukotriene-mediated bronchoconstriction with doses as low as 5 mg.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Moreover, a placebo-controlled, crossover study (n=12) demonstrated that montelukast is capable of inhibiting early and late phase bronchoconstriction caused by antigen challenge by 75% and 57% respectively.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]

Additionally, lactulose is also employed as an adjunct to protein restriction and supportive therapy for the prevention and treatment of portal-systemic encephalopathy (PSE), including both the hepatic pre-coma and coma variations.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] In particular, lactulose solution has been effective at managing PSE resulting from surgical portacaval shunts or from chronic hepatic diseases like cirrhosis.[L6199]



Moreover, there have also been studies demonstrating the capacity for lactulose to minimize the formation of gallstones and even some investigations regarding the experimental use of the agent in developing novel anticancer agents owing to its ability to bind galactin carbohydrates involved in various tumor progressions [L6202].', 'Lactulose is a synthetic disaccharide derivative of lactose that consists of one molecule of galactose and one molecule of fructose.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] Saccharolytic bacteria present in the large intestine subsequently break the substance down into organic acids like lactic acid and small amounts of formic and acetic acids.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] Such resultant volatile fatty acid metabolites, in combination with hydrogen and methane that is also generated consequently enhance intraluminal gas formation, peristaltic gut motility, and elicit an osmotic effect that facilitates an increase in the water content of stool as well as associated stool softening.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] All of these actions ultimately assist in facilitating and increasing the frequency of bowel movements in patients experiencing constipation, although it may take 24 to 48 hours after using the medication for this laxative effect to become evident.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]



At the same time, the formation of such acids via the metabolism of lactulose by colonic bacteria also acidifies the contents of the colon, thereby contributing to the treatment of portal-systemic encephalopathy (PSE).[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] As one of the principal features of PSE involves the accumulation of nitrogenous waste products like ammonia in the systemic circulation, a state in which the colonic contents become more acidic than blood allows ammonia in the circulation to diffuse into the colon.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]. Furthermore, ammonia that diffuses into the acidic colon is ionized to ammonium ions that are incapable of being absorbed back into the blood.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] These effects, combined with the laxative action of lactulose facilitates the excretion of excess ammonia.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] And finally, it is also believed that an acidic colonic environment results in the elimination of urease-producing bacteria that contribute to the formation of ammonia while surviving colonic bacteria use up any trapped ammonia in the colon as a source of nitrogen for protein synthesis.[L6202]', 'Lactulose formulations are most commonly administered via the oral route or the rectal route.[L6202] Consequently, because the substance experiences minimal absorption by the gut it typically remains localized in the gastrointestinal tract environment and ultimately demonstrates almost all of its pharmacologic effects within the gut.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] In particular, as lactulose elicits its laxative effects in enhancing stool amounts and softening stool, such biochemical and physiologic activities can cause increased bowel sounds (borborygmi), a feeling of bloatedness, belching, frequent flatus, and diarrhea.[FDA Label,L6199,L6202]   ', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

In addition, this drug also inhibits the glutathione-S-transferase (a major detoxifying enzyme) and modulates the Avr-14 gene, encoding for the alpha-type subunit of glutamate-gated chloride ion channel present in nematodes. Aside from its well understood non-competitive inhibition of the PFOR in anaerobic bacteria, NTZ also demonstrates various other antibacterial mechanisms. It inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase in E Coli, disrupts the membrane potential and pH homeostasis in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis, suppresses the chaperone/usher (CU) pathway of the gram-negative bacteria,  and stimulates host macrophage autophagy in tuberculosis patients [A31976]. NTZ also suppresses viral replication by inhibiting the maturation of the viral hemagglutinin and the viral transcription factor immediate early 2 (IE2) as well as by activating the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (an antiviral intracellular protein). Lastly, NTZ exhibits an inhibitory effect on tumor cell progression by altering drug detoxification (glutathione-S-transferase P1), unfolded protein response, autophagy, anti-cytokines activity, and c-Myc inhibition [A31976].', 'The general effect of this medication is the prevention of microbe activity through disruption of important energy pathways for survival and proliferation [FDA label, A31976].

In lactotrophs, stimulation of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor causes inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, which decreases intracellular cAMP concentrations and blocks IP3-dependent release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores. Decreases in intracellular calcium levels may also be brought about via inhibition of calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels, rather than via inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Additionally, receptor activation blocks phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK and decreases MAPK/ERK kinase phosphorylation. Inhibition of MAPK appears to be mediated by c-Raf and B-Raf-dependent inhibition of MAPK/ERK kinase. Dopamine-stimulated growth hormone release from the pituitary gland is mediated by a decrease in intracellular calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels rather than via adenylyl cyclase inhibition. Stimulation of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway leads to improvements in coordinated muscle activity in those with movement disorders. ', 'Bromocriptine stimulates centrally-located dopaminergic receptors resulting in a number of pharmacologic effects. Five dopamine receptor types from two dopaminergic subfamilies have been identified. The dopaminergic D1 receptor subfamily consists of D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>5</sub> subreceptors, which are associated with dyskinesias. The dopaminergic D2 receptor subfamily consists of D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub> and D<sub>4</sub> subreceptors, which are associated with improvement of symptoms of movement disorders. Thus, agonist activity specific for D2 subfamily receptors, primarily D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> receptor subtypes, are the primary targets of dopaminergic antiparkinsonian agents. It is thought that postsynaptic D<sub>2</sub> stimulation is primarily responsible for the antiparkinsonian effect of dopamine agonists, while presynaptic D<sub>2</sub> stimulation confers neuroprotective effects. This semisynthetic ergot derivative exhibits potent agonist activity on dopamine D<sub>2</sub>-receptors. It also exhibits agonist activity (in order of decreasing binding affinity) on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)<sub>1D</sub>, dopamine D<sub>3</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>, and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors, antagonist activity on &alpha;<sub>2A</sub>-adrenergic, &alpha;<sub>2C</sub>, &alpha;<sub>2B</sub>, and dopamine D<sub>1</sub> receptors, partial agonist activity at receptor 5-HT<sub>2B</sub>, and inactivates dopamine D<sub>4</sub> and 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptors. Parkinsonian Syndrome manifests when approximately 80% of dopaminergic activity in the nigrostriatal pathway of the brain is lost. As this striatum is involved in modulating the intensity of coordinated muscle activity (e.g. movement, balance, walking), loss of activity may result in dystonia (acute muscle contraction), Parkinsonism (including symptoms of bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, and flattened affect), akathesia (inner restlessness), tardive dyskinesia (involuntary muscle movements usually associated with long-term loss of dopaminergic activity), and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which manifests when complete blockage of nigrostriatal dopamine occurs. High dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain causes hallucinations and delusions; these side effects of dopamine agonists are manifestations seen in patients with schizophrenia who have overractivity in this area of the brain. The hallucinogenic side effects of dopamine agonists may also be due to 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> agonism. The tuberoinfundibular pathway of the brain originates in the hypothalamus and terminates in the pituitary gland. In this pathway, dopamine inhibits lactotrophs in anterior pituitary from secreting prolactin. Increased dopaminergic activity in the tuberoinfundibular pathway inhibits prolactin secretion making bromocriptine an effective agent for treating disorders associated with hypersecretion of prolactin.

', '**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].



Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].



In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].



There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].



Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].



The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. 



In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].



In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].



The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].', 'Zinc is involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of human proteins may bind zinc, in addition to hundreds of proteins that transport and traffic zinc. It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is an essential element for a proper sense of taste and smell and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations [L2211].



Studies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions [L2095]:



**Colds:** Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently [L2095].



**Wound healing:** Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements [L2095]. 



**Diahrrea**: Oral zinc supplements can reduce the symptoms of diarrhea in children with low levels of zinc, especially in cases of malnutrition [L2095].

Erythromycin is indicated in the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of various bacteria.[L7261] The indications for erythromycin have been summarized by body system below:



**Respiratory infections**



Mild to moderate upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenzae (when used concomitantly with appropriate doses of sulfonamides) can be treated with erythromycin.[L7261] Mild to moderate lower-respiratory tract infections due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Streptococcus pyogenes may also be treated. Erythromycin treats listeriosis caused by Listeria monocytogenes may also be treated with erythromycin.[L7261]

Erythromycin is indicated to treat pertussis (whooping cough) caused by Bordetella pertussis. It is effective in eliminating the causative organism from the nasopharynx of infected individuals, rendering them noninfectious. Clinical studies suggest that erythromycin may aid in the prevention of pertussis infection for individuals who have been exposed to the bacteria.[L7261] Respiratory tract infections due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae may also be treated with erythromycin.[L7261]  Despite the fact that no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted to this date, in vitro and certain preliminary clinical study results indicate that erythromycin may be an effective treatment in  Legionnaires’ Disease.[L7261] Finally, erythromycin is indicated to treat diphtheria and other infections due to Corynebacterium diphtheriae, as an adjunct to antitoxin, to prevent carrier status and to eradicate the organism in existing carriers.[L7261] In addition to the prevention of diphtheria, erythromycin can be used to prevent rheumatic fever in penicillin intolerant patients.[L7261]

 



**Skin infections**



Mild to moderate skin or skin structure infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus may be treated with erythromycin, however, resistant staphylococcal organisms may emerge.[L7261] Erythromycin can also be used to treat erythrasma, an infectious condition caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum.[L7261]





**Gastrointestinal infections**



Intestinal amebiasis caused by Entamoeba histolytica can be treated with oral erythromycin. Extraenteric amebiasis warrants treatment with other antimicrobial drugs.[L7261]





**Genital infections/STIs**



Erythromycin can be used as an alternative drug in treating acute pelvic inflammatory disease caused by N. gonorrheae in female patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity or intolerance to penicillin.[L7261] Syphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum, can be treated with erythromycin.  It serves as an alternative treatment for primary syphilis in patients who have demonstrated penicillin hypersensitivity. Erythromycin can also be used in the primary stage of primary syphilis.[L7261] Another approved indication of erythromycin is to treat chlamydial infections that cause conjunctivitis of the newborn, pneumonia of infancy, and urogenital infections occurring in pregnancy. It is indicated as an alternative option to tetracyclines for the treatment of uncomplicated rectal, urethral and endocervical infections in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.[L7261] Erythromycin can be used in nongonococcal urethritis can be used when tetracyclines cannot be administered. Finally, erythromycin is indicated to treat nongonococcal urethritis due to Ureaplasma urealyticum.[L7261]

', 'In order to replicate, bacteria require a specific process of protein synthesis, enabled by ribosomal proteins.[A6505] Erythromycin acts by inhibition of protein synthesis by binding to the 23S ribosomal RNA molecule in the 50S subunit of ribosomes in susceptible bacterial organisms.  It stops bacterial protein synthesis by inhibiting the transpeptidation/translocation step of protein synthesis and by inhibiting the assembly of the 50S ribosomal subunit.[L7261,A14179] This results in the control of various bacterial infections.[A174193,L7261] The strong affinity of macrolides, including erythromycin, for bacterial ribosomes, supports their broad‐spectrum antibacterial activities.[A174193]

Despite this, it is important to perform bacterial susceptibility testing before administering this antibiotic, as resistance is a common issue that may affect treatment.[L7261] 



**A note on antimicrobial resistance, pseudomembranous colitis, and hepatotoxicity**



Many strains of Haemophilus influenzae are resistant to erythromycin alone but are found to be susceptible to erythromycin and sulfonamides used in combination. It is important to note that Staphylococci that are resistant to erythromycin may emerge during erythromycin and/or sulfonamide therapy.[L7261] Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with most antibacterial agents, including erythromycin, and may range in severity from mild to life-threatening. Therefore, the physician should consider this diagnosis in patients with diarrhea after the administration of antibacterial agents.[L7261] Erythromycin can cause hepatic dysfunction, cholestatic jaundice, and abnormal liver transaminases, particularly when erythromycin estolate is administered.[L7270]

These folic acid congeners are transported across cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis where they are needed to maintain normal erythropoiesis, synthesize purine and thymidylate nucleic acids, interconvert amino acids, methylate tRNA, and generate and use formate. Using vitamin B12 as a cofactor, folic acid can normalize high homocysteine levels by remethylation of homocysteine to methionine via methionine synthetase.', 'Folic acid is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin found in foods such as liver, kidney, yeast, and leafy, green vegetables. Also known as folate or Vitamin B9, folic acid is an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in DNA and RNA synthesis. More specifically, folic acid is required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. Folic acid is the precursor of tetrahydrofolic acid, which is involved as a cofactor for transformylation reactions in the biosynthesis of purines and thymidylates of nucleic acids. Impairment of thymidylate synthesis in patients with folic acid deficiency is thought to account for the defective deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis that leads to megaloblast formation and megaloblastic and macrocytic anemias. Folic acid is particularly important during phases of rapid cell division, such as infancy, pregnancy, and erythropoiesis, and plays a protective factor in the development of cancer. As humans are unable to synthesize folic acid endogenously, diet and supplementation is necessary to prevent deficiencies. In order to function properly within the body, folic acid must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted by anti-metabolite therapies such as [DB00563] as they function as DHFR inhibitors to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, and therefore prevent the formation of DHF and THF.

This This 6-member ring enables cefdinir and other cephalosporins to resist inactivation by certain bacterial enzymes.[A180772]



With a mechanism similar to other beta-lactam antibiotics, the bactericidal activity of cefdinir is caused by the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Cefdinir, like other cephalosporins, penetrates the bacterial cell wall, combats inactivation by beta-lactamase enzymes, and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins.[A180772] This interferes with the final step of transpeptidation in cell walls, eventually leading to cell lysis, which eventually leads to the death of bacteria that are susceptible to this drug.[A180724] Cefdinir has shown affinity to penicillin protein binding proteins 2 and 3. [A15746,A180760,A15747] It has also been shown to inhibit transpeptidase enzymes of various bacteria, which may play a role in its bactericidal action.[A180766,A180769] One in vitro study suggests that cefdinir inhibits myeloperoxidase release extracellularly.[A11897] The impact of this potential drug target in relation to its mechanism of action is unknown.', 'Cefdinir is a bactericidal agent that treats bacterial infections by interfering with cell wall synthesis.[L7330]

Cefdinir exerts broad-spectrum activity against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections. It is effective against several beta-lactamase enzyme producing bacteria.

Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]', 'Pitavastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A181421] Pitavastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which increase hepatic uptake of LDL, thereby reducing circulating LDL-C levels. 



In vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that statins exert vasculoprotective effects independent of their lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.[A181424] This includes improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response.



Statins have also been found to bind allosterically to β2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and in T cell activation.[A181559]', 'Pitavastatin is an oral antilipemic agent which inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. It is used to lower total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and trigleride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, rosuvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.[A181087, A181406]



Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]



**Skeletal Muscle Effects**



Pitavastatin may cause myopathy (muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness with creatine kinase (CK) above ten times the upper limit of normal) and rhabdomyolysis (with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria). Rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis with statin use, including pitavastatin. Predisposing factors for myopathy include advanced age (≥65 years), female gender, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and renal impairment. In most cases, muscle symptoms and CK increases resolved when treatment was promptly discontinued. As dosages of pitavastatin greater than 4mg per day were associated with an increased risk of severe myopathy, the product monograph recommends a maximum daily dose of 4mg once daily.[L48616]



The risk of myopathy during treatment with pitavstatin may be increased with concurrent administration of interacting drugs such as [fenofibrate], [niacin], [gemfibrozil], and [cyclosporine].  Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors coadministered with [colchicine], and caution should therefore be exercised when prescribing these two medications together.[L48616]



Real-world data from observational studies has suggested that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.[A182258]



**Hepatic Dysfunction**



Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with pitavastatin. In most cases, the elevations were transient and either resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including pitavastatin.[L48616]



Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury.[L48616]



**Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels**

**Skin and skin structure infections**



Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes', 'Five-member thiazolidine rings that make up penicillins are replaced in cephalosporins by a six-member dihydrothiazine ring, conferring greater bactericidal activity. This This 6-member ring enables cefdinir and other cephalosporins to resist inactivation by certain bacterial enzymes.[A180772]



With a mechanism similar to other beta-lactam antibiotics, the bactericidal activity of cefdinir is caused by the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Cefdinir, like other cephalosporins, penetrates the bacterial cell wall, combats inactivation by beta-lactamase enzymes, and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins.[A180772] This interferes with the final step of transpeptidation in cell walls, eventually leading to cell lysis, which eventually leads to the death of bacteria that are susceptible to this drug.[A180724] Cefdinir has shown affinity to penicillin protein binding proteins 2 and 3. [A15746,A180760,A15747] It has also been shown to inhibit transpeptidase enzymes of various bacteria, which may play a role in its bactericidal action.[A180766,A180769] One in vitro study suggests that cefdinir inhibits myeloperoxidase release extracellularly.[A11897] The impact of this potential drug target in relation to its mechanism of action is unknown.', 'Cefdinir is a bactericidal agent that treats bacterial infections by interfering with cell wall synthesis.[L7330]

Cefdinir exerts broad-spectrum activity against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections. It is effective against several beta-lactamase enzyme producing bacteria.

Acne is a multifactorial condition, and evidence exists to support multiple mechanisms of action for adapalene. Adapalene binds to retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-beta and RAR-gamma; this complex subsequently binds to one of three retinoid X receptors (RXRs), which as a complex is capable of binding DNA to modulate transcriptional activity.[A193509] Although the full extent of transcriptional modulation is not described, retinoid activation is generally known to affect cellular proliferation and differentiation[A193527], and adapalene has been shown to inhibit HeLa cell proliferation and human keratinocyte differentiation.[A193515] These effects primarily account for adapalene''s comedolytic and anticomedogenic properties.



In addition, adapalene modulates the immune response by down-regulating toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2) expression and inhibiting the transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP-1). TLR-2 recognizes _Cutibacterium acnes_ (formerly _Propionibacterium acnes_), the bacterium primarily associated with acne. TLR-2 activation causes nuclear translocation of AP-1 and downstream pro-inflammatory gene regulation. Therefore, adapalene has a general anti-inflammatory effect, which reduces inflammation-mediated acne symptoms.[A193512]

The immunomodulatory actions of lenalidomide can be partly explained by the degradation of IKZF3, since it is a repressor of the interleukin 2 gene (IL2): as lenalidomide decreases the level of IKZF3, the production of IL-2 increases, thereby increasing the proliferation of natural killer (NK), NKT cells, and CD4+ T cells.[A228703] Lenalidomide inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-12, while elevating the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.[A228543] Lenalidomide acts as a T-cell co-stimulatory molecule that promotes CD3 T-cell proliferation and increases the production of IL-2 and IFN-γ in T lymphocytes, which enhances NK cell cytotoxicity and ADCC. It inhibits the expression and function of T-regulatory cells, which are often overabundant in some hematological malignancies.[A228708] 



Lenalidomide directly exerts antitumour effects by inhibiting the proliferation and inducing apoptosis of tumour cells. Lenalidomide triggers the activation of pro-apoptotic caspase-8, enhances tumour cell sensitivity to FAS-induced apoptosis, and downregulates NF-κB, an anti-apoptotic protein.[A228708] Independent of its immunomodulatory effects, lenalidomide mediates anti-angiogenic effects by inhibiting angiogenic growth factors released by tumour cells, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblastic-growth factor (BFGF), and hepatocyte-growth factor. _In vitro_, lenalidomide inhibits cell adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1, LFA-1, β2 and β3 integrins, as well as gap-junction function, thereby preventing metastasis of malignant cells.[A228708] ', 'In hematological malignancies, the immune system is deregulated in the form of altered cytokine networks in the tumour microenvironment, defective T cell regulation of host-tumour immune interactions, and diminished NK cell activity.[A228543] Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent with antineoplastic, antiangiogenic, and anti-inflammatory properties.[A228628] Lenalidomide exerts direct cytotoxicity by increasing apoptosis and inhibiting the proliferation of hematopoietic malignant cells.[A228708] It delays tumour growth in nonclinical hematopoietic tumour models _in vivo_, including multiple myeloma.[L16028] Lenalidomide also works to limit the invasion or metastasis of tumour cells and inhibits angiogenesis.[A228708]



Lenalidomide also mediates indirect antitumour effects via its immunomodulatory actions: it inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are implicated in various hematologic malignancies. Lenalidomide enhances the host immunity by stimulating T cell proliferation and enhancing the activity of natural killer (NK) cells.[A713, A228703, A228708] Lenalidomide is about 100–1000 times more potent in stimulating T cell proliferation than [thalidomide].[A228543] _In vitro_, it enhances antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), which is even more pronounced when used in combination with rituximab.[L16028] Due to its anti-inflammatory properties, lenalidomide has been investigated in the context of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[A229418] ', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

[L39095] Patients may experience ED due to a variety of causes including psychogenic, neurogenic, vasculogenic, iatrogenic, or endocrine. [A242392] These causes result in dysfunction of penile smooth muscle relaxation through either disrupted neuronal signaling or direct influence on smooth muscle cells. During sexual arousal, non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) neurons release nitric oxide (NO). Nitric oxide stimulates guanylate cyclase which converts guanosine triphosphate to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).[A242287, A242377] cGMP activates the cGMP-dependent kinase (PKG) in a signal cascade which activates K+ channels leading to inhibition of Ca2+ channels, inhibits platelet activation, and inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation while inducing apoptosis. This signal cascade is attenuated by PDE5 which breaks the phosphodiester bond of cGMP, converting it to GMP. Inhibition of PDE5 by tadalafil increases signaling via the PKG cascade which supports penile smooth muscle relaxation during sexual arousal by decreasing Ca2+ entry into smooth muscle cells. This smooth muscle relaxation allows blood to fill the corpus cavernosum thereby producing an erection.



In PAH, blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries is raised due to a variety of mechanisms stemming from endothelial dysfunction.[A242377] Decreased production of NO and prostacyclin reduce vasodilatory signaling while overproduction of endothelin-1 and thromboxane increase vasoconstriction. Inflammation, thromboses, and hypoxia later contribute to vascular remodeling which further reduces luminal size. The resultant increase in blood pressure reduces the capacity for gas exchange and increases afterload at the right ventricle, producing symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and dizziness as well as leading to right-sided heart failure. Tadalafil exerts its therapeutic effect in PAH through boosting NO-cGMP signaling to contribute to smooth muscle relaxation as with ED.



Lastly, tadalafil is used to treat BPH.[L39095] BPH produces urinary dysfunction through hyperproliferation of the epithelial and smooth muscle layers of the prostate.[A242382] The increased size of the prostate blocks urine flow through the urethra resulting in higher residual volumes due to incomplete emptying. Tadalafil does not appear to exert its benefit via smooth muscle relaxation of the prostate. It may instead exert its effect through a mix of increased oxygenation and decreased inflammation, which decreases tissue remodeling, and inhibition of cell proliferation through the cGMP cascade.

As a result, cerebral edema, elevated intracranial pressure, and cerebrospinal fluid volume and pressure may be reduced. As a diurectic mannitol induces diuresis because it is not reabsorbed in the renal tubule, thereby increasing the osmolality of the glomerular filtrate, facilitating excretion of water, and inhibiting the renal tubular reabsorption of sodium, chloride, and other solutes. Mannitol promotes the urinary excretion of toxic materials and protects against nephrotoxicity by preventing the concentration of toxic substances in the tubular fluid. As an Antiglaucoma agent mannitol levates blood plasma osmolarity, resulting in enhanced flow of water from the eye into plasma and a consequent reduction in intraocular pressure. As a renal function diagnostic aid mannitol is freely filtered by the glomeruli with less than 10% tubular reabsorption. Therefore, its urinary excretion rate may serve as a measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR).



The exact mechanism of action of inhaled mannitol in the symptomatic maintenance treatment of cystic fibrosis remains unclear.[A223199, L20024] It is hypothesized that mannitol produces an osmotic gradient across the airway epithelium that draws fluid into the extracellular space and alters the properties of the airway surface mucus layer, allowing easier mucociliary clearance.[A223199]', 'Chemically, mannitol is an alcohol and a sugar, or a polyol; it is similar to xylitol or sorbitol.

However, since cod liver oil is a composite of several other nutritional compounds including the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as well as vitamin A and vitamin D [A33159, L2872, L2871], the presence in varying amounts of all of these compounds at once makes it difficult to recommend or use cod liver oil as an appropriate supplement to confer any one particular health effect or for any one particular nutritional deficiency.



Regardless, because it does contain a combination of a number of important and healthy nutritional compounds, cod liver oil has sometimes been recommended in the literature for conferring the health effects of some of these compounds, such as the potential use of cod liver oil supplements in post-heart attack patients for secondary prophylaxis associated with the use of omega-3 fatty acids [A33165].', 'As cod liver oil consists of the component compounds of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), vitamin A, and vitamin D [A33159, L2872, L2871] further information about the mechanisms of action of these cod liver oil components can be found by searching for fish oil, vitamin A, and vitamin D on DrugBank.', 'As cod liver oil is a composite of several other nutritional compounds including the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as well as vitamin A and vitamin D [A33159, L2872, L2871], the presence in varying amounts of all of these compounds at once makes it difficult to recommend or use cod liver oil as an appropriate supplement to confer any one particular health effect or for any one particular nutritional deficiency.



For example, one tablespoon of cod liver oil contains approximately 4,080 ug of retinol (vitamin A) and 34 ug (1,360 IU) of vitamin D [L2871]. Since the general dietary reference intake of vitamin A is only 900 ug per day for adult men, 700 ug per day for women, and 3000 ug per day as the tolerable upper intake level, the regular intake of cod liver oil as a regular supplement can result in harmful levels of vitamin A accumulating in the liver and sufficient to cause hypervitaminosis A [A33163], which is associated with various symptoms such as blurred vision, changes in consciousness, skin and hair changes, liver damage, among many others.



Moreover, while cod liver oil only contains a certain percentage of the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA per amount of the oil [L2871], separate fish oils supplement products that exclusively consist of only EPA and DHA are available in a great variety of different percentage content formulations, even including prescription strength formulations should certain patients need such a level of therapy. Furthermore, such exclusive omega-3 fatty acid supplement products do not contain any vitamin A or D either, which allows patients to use the supplements without any concern about affecting their vitamin A or D levels or exposing themselves to the unnecessary excess intake of vitamins.



Subsequently, although cod liver oil contains a combination of healthy dietary supplements like EPA, DHA, vitamin A, and vitamin D, the presence in varying amounts of all of these compounds all at once makes it difficult to effectively titrate for appropriate amounts of intake for all the compounds involved when using cod liver oil as a general supplement, often resulting in either an excess or insufficient amount of one or more the aforementioned compounds.



Nevertheless, because cod liver oil does consist of the component compounds of EPA, DHA, vitamin A, and vitamin D, further information about the pharmacodynamics of these cod liver oil components can be found by searching for fish oil, vitamin A, and vitamin D on DrugBank.', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Activation of this system upon stimulation by different factors, such as low blood pressure and nerve impulses, leads to increased release of norepinephrine (NE) from sympathetic nerve terminals and effects on the vascular growth, vasoconstriction, and salt retention in the kidneys.[T28] Renin is released from 

Renin acts on the precursor prottein angiotensinogen, which is a plasma globulin synthesized from the liver, to produce cleaved peptide hormone angiotensin I.[T28] Angiotensin I then can be further cleaved by ACE to produce angiotensin II, a vasoconstrictive peptide hormone.[label] Present in different isoforms, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is peptidyl dipeptidase enzyme expressed in various tissues, including the vascular tissues, such as the heart, brain, and kidneys.[T28] ACE also plays a role in inactivation of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide.[T28,label] Angiotensin II mediates various actions on the body by working on its G-protein coupled receptors, AT1 and AT2.[T28] It causes direct vasoconstriction of precapillary arterioles and postcapillary venules, inhibits the reuptake of NE thereby increasing available levels, stimulates the release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla, reduces urinary excretion of sodium ions and water by promoting proximal tubular reabsorption, stimulates synthesis and release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, and stimulates hypertrophy of both vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiac myocytes.[L6619]



Enalapril is a pharmacologically inactive prodrug that requires hepatic biotransformation to form [enalaprilat], its active metabolite that works on the RAAS to inhibit ACE.[label] Biotransformation is critial for the therapeutic actions of the drug, as enalapril itself is only a weak inhibitor of ACE.[A179131] ACE inhibition results in reduced production and plasma levels of angiotensin II, increased plasma renin activity due to the loss of feedback inhibition by angiotensin II, and decreased aldosterone secretion.[L6586] However, plasma aldosterone levels usually return to normal during long-term administration of enalapril.[A179140] Decreased levels of angiotensin II subsequently leads to the dilatation of peripheral vessles and reduced vascular resistance which in turn lower blood pressure.[A179140] While inhibition of ACE leading to suppression of RAAS is thought to be the primary mechanism of action of enalapril, the drug was shown to still exert antihypertensive effects on individuals with low-renin hypertension. It is suggested that enalapril may mediate its pharmacological actions via other modes of action that are not fully understood.[label] As ACE is structurally similar to kininase I, which is a carboxypeptidase that degrades bradykinin, whether increased levels of bradykinin play a role in the therapeutic effects of enalapril remains to be elucidated.[label]', 'Enalapril is an antihypertensive agent that exhibits natriuretic and uricosuric properties. Enalapril lowers blood pressure in all grades of essential and renovascular hypertension, and peripheral vascular resistance without causing an increase in heart rate.[A179137] Individuals with low-renin hypertensive population were still responsive to enalapril.[label] The duration of hypertensive effect in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure persists for at least 24 hours following initial administration of a single oral dose, and repeated daily administration of enalapril confers an additional reduction in blood pressure and a steady-state antihypertensive response may take several weeks.[A179140] In patients with severe congestive heart failure and inadequate clinical response to conventional antihypertensive therapies, treatment with enalapril resulted in improvements in cardiac performance as observed by a reduction in both preload and afterload, and improved clinical status long-term.[A179137] Furthermore, enalapril was shown to increase cardiac output and stroke volume while decreasing pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in patients with congestive heart failure refractory to conventional treatment with digitalis and diuretics. In clinical studies, enalapril reduced left ventricular mass, and did not affect cardiac function or myocardial perfusion during exercise.[A179134] Enalapril is not highly associated with the risk of bradycardia unlike most diuretics and beta-blockers [A179137] and it does not produce rebound hypertension upon discontinuation of therapy.[A179134]

The exact mechanisms by which topiramate exerts pharmacological actions on seizures and migraines are currently not fully characterized.[A188336,L10544]  Several properties of this drug, however, are likely to contribute to its therapeutic effects. Topiramate has been observed to exert actions on voltage-dependent sodium channels, GABA receptors, and glutamate receptors.[A175249,L10544] 



Topiramate stimulates GABA-A receptor activity at brain non-benzodiazepine receptor sites and reduces glutamate activity at both AMPA and kainate receptors. Normally, GABA-A receptors are inhibitory and glutaminergic receptors are stimulatory for neuronal activity.[A175243,T752] By increasing GABA activity and inhibiting glutamate activity, topiramate blocks neuronal excitability, preventing seizures and migraines.[A188333,A188309,L10544] Additionally, it blocks the voltage-dependent sodium channels, further blocking seizure activity.[A175243] Topiramate has been shown to inhibit various carbonic anhydrase isozymes, but the clinical significance of this is unknown at this time.[A10342,A10348,A20066,L10544]

The retention of phosphate plays a pivotal role in causing secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with osteodystrophy, and soft-tissue calcification. The mechanism by which phosphate retention leads to hyperparathyroidism is not clearly delineated. Therapeutic efforts directed toward the control of hyperphosphatemia include reduction in the dietary intake of phosphate, inhibition of absorption of phosphate in the intestine with phosphate binders, and removal of phosphate from the body by more efficient methods of dialysis. The rate of removal of phosphate by dietary manipulation or by dialysis is insufficient. Dialysis patients absorb 40% to 80% of dietary phosphorus. Therefore, the fraction of dietary phosphate absorbed from the diet needs to be reduced by using phosphate binders in most renal failure patients on maintenance dialysis. Calcium acetate when taken with meals combines with dietary phosphate to form insoluble calcium phosphate which is excreted in the feces. Maintenance of serum phosphorus below 6.0 mg/dl is generally considered as a clinically acceptable outcome of treatment with phosphate binders.

After ingestion, allopurinol is metabolized to its active metabolite, oxypurinol (_alloxanthine_) in the liver [T508], which acts as an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase enzyme [FDA label]. 



Allopurinol and its active metabolite inhibit xanthine oxidase, the enzyme that converts hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid. Inhibition of this enzyme is responsible for the effects of allopurinol. This drug increases the reutilization of hypoxanthine and xanthine for nucleotide and nucleic acid synthesis by a process that involves the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRTase).  This process results in an increased nucleotide concentration, which causes feedback inhibition of de novo purine synthesis. The end result is decreased urine and serum uric acid concentrations [F3988], which decreases the incidence of gout symptoms. 



Accompanying the reduction of serum uric acid by allopurinol is an increase in the serum and urine concentrations of hypoxanthine and xanthine (due to inhibition of xanthine oxidase).  In the absence of allopurinol, regular urinary excretion of oxypurines almost entirely occurs in the form of uric acid. After the ingestion of allopurinol, the contents of excreted urine are hypoxanthine, xanthine, and uric acid. Because each substance has its own individual solubility, the concentration of uric acid in plasma is decreased without exposing the renal tissues to a high load of uric acid, thereby decreasing the risk of crystalluria. By lowering the uric acid concentration in the plasma below its limits of solubility, allopurinol encourages the dissolution of gout tophi. Although the levels of hypoxanthine and xanthine are found to be increased after allopurinol ingestion, the risk of deposition in renal tissues is less than that of uric acid, as they become more soluble and are rapidly excreted by the kidney [F3988]. ', '

Allopurinol decreases the production of uric acid by stopping the biochemical reactions that precede its formation [FDA label].  This process decreases urate and relieves the symptoms of gout, which may include painful tophi, joint pain, inflammation, redness, decreased range of motion, and swelling [A665].

The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE<sub>2</sub> act via EP<sub>3</sub> to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP<sub>2</sub> to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI<sub>2</sub> is known to play a role via its G<sub>s</sub>-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.



PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP<sub>2</sub> receptors.[T116,A179044] Similarly to β adrenergic receptors these are G<sub>s</sub>-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE<sub>2</sub> also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.[T116] PGD<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP<sub>1</sub> receptor.[A179044] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.



PGE<sub>2</sub> can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory G<sub>q</sub> EP<sub>3</sub> receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.[T116] This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever. NSAIDs prevent the generation of PGE<sub>2</sub> thereby reducing the activity of these neurons.

By doing so, it inhibits acid secretion into the gsatric lumen. This effect is dose-related and leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus.



Esomeprazole is the s-isomer of [DB00338], which is a racemate of the S- and R-enantiomer. Esomeprazole has been shown to inhibit acid secretion to a similar extent as [DB00338], without any significant differences between the two compounds _in vitro_. 



PPIs such as esomeprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]



Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as esomeprazole has been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Off-label uses: irritable bowel syndrome, sleep disorders, diabetic neuropathy, agitation, fibromyalgia, and insomnia ', 'The mechanism of action of this drug is not fully elucidated. It is suggested that amitriptyline inhibits the membrane pump mechanism responsible for the re-uptake of transmitter amines, such as norepinephrine and serotonin, thereby increasing their concentration at the synaptic clefts of the brain [FDA label], [A174673].   These amines are important in regulating mood.  The monoamine hypothesis in depression, one of the oldest hypotheses, postulates that deficiencies of serotonin (5-HT) and/or norepinephrine (NE) neurotransmission in the brain lead to depressive effects [A174670].   This drug counteracts these mechanisms, and this may be the mechanism of amitriptyline in improving depressive symptoms.



Whether its analgesic effects are related to its mood-altering activities or attributable to a different, less obvious pharmacological action (or a combination of both) is unknown [A174661].', '**Effects in pain and depression**



Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant and an analgesic. It has anticholinergic and sedative properties [FDA label]. 

Clinical studies have shown that oral amitriptyline achieves, at a minimum, good to moderate response in up to 2/3 of patients diagnosed with post-herpetic neuralgia and 3/4 of patients diagnosed with diabetic neuropathic pain, and neurogenic pain syndromes that are frequently unresponsive to narcotic analgesics. Amitriptyline has also shown efficacy in diverse groups of patients with chronic non-malignant pain. There have also been some studies showing efficacy in managing fibromyalgia (an off-label use of this drug) [A174658], [A174667].



**Cardiovascular and Anticholinergic Effects**



Amitriptyline has strong anticholinergic properties and may cause ECG changes and quinidine-like effects on the heart [F3454]. Amitriptyline may inhibit ion channels, which are necessary for cardiac repolarization (hERG channels), in the upper micromolar range of therapeutic plasma concentrations. Therefore, amitriptyline may increase the risk for cardiac arrhythmia [FDA label]. Orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia can be a problem in elderly patients receiving this drug at normal doses for depression. There is evidence in the literature that these effects may occur, rarely, at the lower dosages utilized in the treatment of pain. As with any other tricyclic antidepressant agent, increased glucose levels can occur with amitriptyline [A174661].

', 'There are two isoforms of ACE: the somatic isoform, which exists as a glycoprotein comprised of a single polypeptide chain of 1277; and the testicular isoform, which has a lower molecular mass and is thought to play a role in sperm maturation and binding of sperm to the oviduct epithelium. Somatic ACE has two functionally active domains, N and C, which arise from tandem gene duplication. Although the two domains have high sequence similarity, they play distinct physiological roles. The C-domain is predominantly involved in blood pressure regulation while the N-domain plays a role in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and proliferation. ACE inhibitors bind to and inhibit the activity of both domains, but have much greater affinity for and inhibitory activity against the C-domain. Captopril, one of the few ACE inhibitors that is not a prodrug, competes with ATI for binding to ACE and inhibits and enzymatic proteolysis of ATI to ATII. Decreasing ATII levels in the body decreases blood pressure by inhibiting the pressor effects of ATII as described in the Pharmacology section above. Captopril also causes an increase in plasma renin activity likely due to a loss of feedback inhibition mediated by ATII on the release of renin and/or stimulation of reflex mechanisms via baroreceptors. Captopril’s affinity for ACE is approximately 30,000 times greater than that of ATI.', 'Captopril, an ACE inhibitor, antagonizes the effect of the RAAS. The RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from the granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. In the blood stream, renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to ATI, which is subsequently cleaved to ATII by ACE. ATII increases blood pressure using a number of mechanisms. First, it stimulates the secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone travels to the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and collecting tubule of nephrons where it increases sodium and water reabsorption by increasing the number of sodium channels and sodium-potassium ATPases on cell membranes. Second, ATII stimulates the secretion of vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone or ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland. ADH stimulates further water reabsorption from the kidneys via insertion of aquaporin-2 channels on the apical surface of cells of the DCT and collecting tubules. Third, ATII increases blood pressure through direct arterial vasoconstriction. Stimulation of the Type 1 ATII receptor on vascular smooth muscle cells leads to a cascade of events resulting in myocyte contraction and vasoconstriction. In addition to these major effects, ATII induces the thirst response via stimulation of hypothalamic neurons. ACE inhibitors inhibit the rapid conversion of ATI to ATII and antagonize RAAS-induced increases in blood pressure. ACE (also known as kininase II) is also involved in the enzymatic deactivation of bradykinin, a vasodilator. Inhibiting the deactivation of bradykinin increases bradykinin levels and may sustain its effects by causing increased vasodilation and decreased blood pressure.', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

(b) the prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in patients who are 6 years of age and older[L6301], although other regional health authorities specifically note this indication for adults and adolescents who are 15 years and older[L6304,L6307]; and



(c) the relief of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis in patients 2 years of age and older and perennial allergic rhinitis in patients 6 months of age and older[L6301], although other regional health authorities specifically note the relief of seasonal allergic rhinitis symptoms for adults and adolescents who are 15 years and older[L6304,L6307].



Furthermore, some formulations like chewable montelukast tablets may also be specifically indicated by particular regulatory bodies for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma, including the prevention of day and night-time symptoms, the treatment of acetylsalicylic acid based asthma, and the prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in adult and pediatric patients aged 2 and older[L6328], between the ages 2 and 5[L6325], or between the ages of 6 and 14 years.[L6331]



Moreover, when employed for such indications montelukast is considered effective as monotherapy or when combined with other medications indicated for the maintenance treatment of chronic asthma.[L6304,L6328] For instance, montelukast and inhaled corticosteroids can be used concomitantly to demonstrate additive effects to control asthma or to decrease the necessary inhaled corticosteroid dose while still maintaining clinical stability.[L6304,L6328]



Additionally, in patients who continue to experience asthma symptoms, montelukast can also be combined with an ''as required'' short-acting beta-agonist, an inhaled corticosteroid, or inhaled corticosteroid paired with a long-acting beta-agonist.[L6304,L6328]', 'Cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLT) like LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4, among others, are eicosanoids released by a variety of cells like mast cells and eosinophils.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] When such CysLT bind to corresponding CysLT receptors like CysLT type-1 receptors located on respiratory airway smooth muscle cells, airway macrophages, and on various pro-inflammatory cells like eosinophils and some specific myeloid stem cells activities that facilitate the pathophysiology of asthma and allergic rhinitis are stimulated.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]



In particular, CysLT-mediated airway bronchoconstriction, occluding mucous secretion, vascular permeability, and eosinophil recruitment are all types of effects that facilitate asthma.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Alternatively, in allergic rhinitis, CysLTs are released by the nasal mucosa when exposed to allergens during both early and late phase reactions and participate in eliciting symptoms of allergic rhinitis like a congested nose and airway.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]



Subsequently, montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that binds with high affinity and selectivity to the CysLT type 1 receptor, which consequently assists in inhibiting any physiological actions of CysLTs like LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 at the receptor that may facilitate asthma or allergic rhinitis.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]', 'Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that demonstrates a marked affinity and selectivity to the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor type-1 in preference to many other crucial airway receptors like the prostanoid, cholinergic, or beta-adrenergic receptors.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] As a consequence, the agent can elicit substantial blockage of LTD4 leukotriene-mediated bronchoconstriction with doses as low as 5 mg.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Moreover, a placebo-controlled, crossover study (n=12) demonstrated that montelukast is capable of inhibiting early and late phase bronchoconstriction caused by antigen challenge by 75% and 57% respectively.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]



In particular, it has been documented that montelukast can cause bronchodilation as soon as within 2 hours of oral administration.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] This action can also be additive to the bronchodilation caused by the concomitant use of a beta agonist.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Nevertheless, clinical investigations performed with adults 15 years of age and older revealed that no additional clinical benefit is obtained when doses of montelukast greater than 10 mg a day are used.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]



Additionally, in clinical trials with adults and pediatric asthmatic patients aged 6 to 14 years, it was also determined that montelukast can reduce mean peripheral blood eosinophils by about 13% to 15% from baseline in comparison to placebo during double-blind treatment periods.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] At the same time, in patients aged 15 years and older who were experiencing seasonal allergic rhinitis, the use of montelukast caused a median reduction of 13% in peripheral blood eosinophil counts when compared to placebo as well.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Under EMA approval, such fish oil pharmaceuticals comprised of virtually the same fish and fish oil derived omega-3-fatty acids EPA and DHA are indicated specifically for (a) adjuvant treatment in secondary prevention after myocardial infarction, in addition to other standard therapy (ie. statins, antiplatelet medicinal products, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors), and (b) as a supplement to diet when dietary measures alone are insufficient to produce an adequate response, particularly with type IV hypertriglyceridemia in monotherapy or type IIb/III in combination with statins, when control of triglycerides is insufficient [L2661]. In addition, prescribing information for EMA approved fish oil pharmaceuticals are also indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce very high (>=500 mg/dL) triglyceride levels in adult patients, much like similar FDA approved indications [F37, FDA Label].', 'The specific mechanism of action by which the fish oil EPA and DHA acids are capable of reducing serum triglyceride levels is not yet fully understood [FDA Label, A32933]. Nevertheless, it is proposed that such omega-3-fatty acids may not be the preferred substrates of the enzyme diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase that participates in the generation of triglycerides; that  they might interact with nuclear transcription factors that manage lipogenesis; or that their presence and increase in levels can cause cellular metabolism to subsequently shift toward a decrease in triglyceride synthesis and an increase in fatty acid oxidation [A32933]. Moreover, the EPA and DHA acids are also believed to be able to promote apolipoprotein B degradation in the liver through the stimulation of an autophagic process [A32933]. It may also be possible that these fish oil acids can accelerate the clearance of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles and chylomicron [A32933]. The combination of all these actions results in fewer VLDL particles being assembled and secreted, which is of considerable importance as VLDL particles are the major endogenous source of triglycerides [A32933].



Moreover, new paradigms of how inflammation is contained and dissipated involve various newly discovered chemical mediators, resolvins, and protectins [A32933]. Such agents are believed to be directly involved in blocking neutrophil migration, infiltration, recruitment, as well as blocking T-cell migration and promoting T-cell apoptosis [A32933]. Additionally, such protectins can also reduce tumor necrosis factor and interferon secretion [A32933]. Of particular importance, however, is the fact that protectins and resolvins are exclusively derived from omega-3-fatty acids and that EPA is the substrate of the resolvins family and DHA can be converted to both resolvins and protectins [A32933]. It is believed that these effects of such fish oil acids underlie the actions that fish oil have demonstrated on eliciting stability for vulnerable inflammatory plaques [A32933].



Finally, fish oil acids have demonstrated certain direct electrophysiological effects on the myocardium [A32933]. In animal studies, it was shown that the ventricular fibrillation threshold could be increased in both animals fed or infused with omega-3-fatty acids [A32933]. Further studies subsequently revealed that such fatty acids could reduce both sodium currents and L-type calcium currents on a cellular and ion channel level [A32933]. It is consequently hypothesized that during ischemia, a reduction in the sodium ion current protects hyperexcitable tissue, and a reduction in the calcium ion current could reduce arrhythmogenic depolarizing currents - and that perhaps the use of EPA and DHA fish oil acids could facilitate such activity [A32933]. For the time being, however, omega-3-fatty acids in pharmaceutical supplement form have not been shown to elicit such protection against heart conditions [L2662].', 'In general, the only practical method of obtaining and increasing the levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) fish oil omega-3-fatty acids in the body is to consume them directly from foods and/or dietary supplements [L784]. Having EPA and DHA is important because they facilitate numerous important functions in the human body. As an example, such supplementation of fish oil EPA and DHA demonstrates a legitimate ability to decrease triglyceride levels as their presence in the body can act as poor substrates for the enzymes that are ordinarily responsible for triglyceride synthesis and also inhibit the esterification of other fatty acids, among other mechanisms [FDA Label, L2661].



Moreover, such fish oil acids can become important components of the phospholipids that form the structures of cell membranes [L784]. Specifically, DHA is particularly high in the retina, brain, and sperm [L784]. Additionally, these acids also provide energy for the body and are used to form eicosanoids - signaling molecules that have similar chemical structures to the fish oil fatty acids from which they are derived [L784]. Furthermore, such eicosanoids possess wide-ranging functions in the cardiovascular, pulmonary, immune, and endocrine systems [L784].', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

These active metabolites are nucleosides that mediate antitumour effects. dFdCTP competes with deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) for incorporation into DNA, thereby competitively inhibiting DNA chain elongation. The non-terminal position of dFdCTP in the DNA chain prevents detection of dFdCTP in the chain and repair by proof-reading 3′5′-exonuclease: this process is referred to as "masked DNA chain termination." Incorporation of dFdCTP into the DNA chain ultimately leads to chain termination, DNA fragmentation, and apoptotic cell death of malignant cells.[A233140,A233145,L32950]



Gemcitabine has self-potentiating pharmacological actions that can increase the probability of successful incorporation of gemcitabine triphosphate into the DNA chain: dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, an enzyme responsible for catalyzing the reactions that generate dCTP for DNA synthesis. Since dFdCDP reduces the levels of dCTP, there is less competition for gemcitabine triphosphate for incorporation into DNA.[A233140,L32950] Gemcitabine can also reduce metabolism and elimination of active metabolites from the target ce1l, prolonging high intracellular concentrations of the active metabolites. Such self-potentiating effects are not present with [cytarabine].[A233140]', 'Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analog that mediates its antitumour effects by promoting apoptosis of malignant cells undergoing DNA synthesis. More specifically, it blocks the progression of cells through the G1/S-phase boundary.[L32950] Gemcitabine demonstrated cytotoxic effects against a broad range of cancer cell lines _in vitro_. It displayed schedule-dependent antitumour activity in various animal models and xenografts from human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreatic cancer.[A233140] Therefore, the antineoplastic effects of gemcitabine are enhanced through prolonged infusion time rather than higher dosage.[A233140] Gemcitabine inhibited the growth of human xenografts from carcinoma of the lung, pancreas, ovaries, head and neck, and breast. In mice, gemcitabine inhibited the growth of human tumour xenografts from the breast, colon, lung or pancreas by 69 to 99%. In clinical trials of advanced NSCLC, gemcitabine monotherapy produced objective response rates ranging from 18 to 26%, with a median duration of response ranging from 3.3 to 12.7 months. Overall median survival time was 6.2 to 12.3 months. The combined use of cisplatin and gemcitabine produced better objective response rates compared to monotherapy. In patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, objective response rates in patients ranged from 5.to 12%, with a median survival duration of 3.9 to 6.3 months.[A233145] In Phase II trials involving patients with metastatic breast cancer, treatment with gemcitabine alone or with adjuvant chemotherapies resulted in response rate ranging from 13 to 42% and median survival duration ranging from 11.5 to 17.8 months. In metastatic bladder cancer, gemcitabine has a response rate 20 to 28%. In Phase II trials of advanced ovarian cancer, patients treated with gemcitabine had response rate of 57.1%, with progression free survival of 13.4 months and median survival of 24 months.[A233140]



Gemcitabine causes dose-limiting myelosuppression, such as anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia; however, events leading to discontinuation tend to occur less than 1% of the patients. Gemcitabine can elevate ALT, AST and alkaline phosphatase levels.[A233145]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy are associated with the release of serotonin (5-HT) from enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine, presumably initiating a vomiting reflex through stimulation of 5-HT3 receptors located on vagal afferents [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Ondansetron may block the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a central release of serotonin from the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle [F3178, F3181, F3184]. Thus, the antiemetic effect of ondansetron is probably due to the selective antagonism of 5-HT3 receptors on neurons located in either the peripheral or central nervous systems, or both [F3178, F3181, F3184].



Although the mechanisms of action of ondansetron in treating postoperative nausea and vomiting and cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting may share similar pathways, the role of ondansetron in opiate-induced emesis has not yet been formally established [F3181, F3184].', 'Ondansetron is a highly specific and selective serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist, not shown to have activity at other known serotonin receptors and with low affinity for dopamine receptors [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161]. The serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery, and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161]. The temporal relationship between the emetogenic action of emetogenic drugs and the release of serotonin, as well as the efficacy of antiemetic agents, suggest that chemotherapeutic agents release serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine by causing degenerative changes in the GI tract [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161]. The serotonin then stimulates the vagal and splanchnic nerve receptors that project to the medullary vomiting center, as well as the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors in the area postrema, thus initiating the vomiting reflex, causing nausea and vomiting [FDA Label], [A1160, A1161].



Moreover, the effect of ondansetron on the QTc interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo and positive (moxifloxacin) controlled, crossover study in 58 healthy adult men and women [F3181, F3184]. Ondansetron was tested at single doses of 8 mg and 32 mg infused intravenously over 15 minutes [F3181, F3184]. At the highest tested dose of 32 mg, prolongation of the Fridericia-corrected QTc interval (QT/RR0.33=QTcF) was observed from 15 min to 4 h after the start of the 15 min infusion, with a maximum mean (upper limit of 90% CI) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline-correction of 19.6 (21.5) msec at 20 min [F3181, F3184]. At the lower tested dose of 8 mg, QTc prolongation was observed from 15 min to 1 h after the start of the 15-minute infusion, with a maximum mean (upper limit of 90% CI) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline-correction of 5.8 (7.8) msec at 15 min [F3181, F3184]. The magnitude of QTc prolongation with ondansetron is expected to be greater if the infusion rate is faster than 15 minutes [F3181, F3184]. The 32 mg intravenous dose of ondansetron must not be administered [F3181, F3184]. No treatment-related effects on the QRS duration or the PR interval were observed at either the 8 or 32 mg dose [F3181, F3184].



An ECG assessment study has not been performed for orally administered ondansetron [F3181, F3184]. On the basis of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling, an 8 mg oral dose of ondansetron is predicted to cause a mean QTcF increase of 0.7 ms (90% CI -2.1, 3.3) at steady-state, assuming a mean maximal plasma concentration of 24.7 ng/mL (95% CI 21.1, 29.0) [F3181, F3184]. The magnitude of QTc prolongation at the recommended 5 mg/m2 dose in pediatrics has not been studied, but pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling predicts a mean increase of 6.6 ms (90% CI 2.8, 10.7) at maximal plasma concentrations [F3181, F3184]. 



In healthy subjects, single intravenous doses of 0.15 mg/kg of ondansetron had no effect on esophageal motility, gastric motility, lower esophageal sphincter pressure, or small intestinal transit time [F3178].

Although the cause of IBS has yet to be formally elucidated, patient experience has demonstrated that the disorder is typically associated with abdominal pain, abdominal distension, cramping or bloating, variations in urgency for bowel movements, feelings of incomplete evacuation, gastroesophageal reflux, and various other effects [A176669, F4223, F4226, F4229]. In particular, IBS that features constipation as a predominant effect is categorized as constipation-predominant IBS, or IBS-C [F4223, F4229].



Concurrently, 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, or serotonin) has demonstrated the ability to elicit significant regulatory actions on gastrointestinal motility [A11044]. Specifically, it has been shown that the activation of 5-HT(4) receptors located on motor neurons and interneurons in the gastrointestinal wall can cause the release of acetylcholine, substance P, and calcitonin gene-related peptide that can all facilitate the propulsion of material through the gut [A11044]. Moreover, when 5-HT(4) receptors located in smooth muscle cells are also activated, activities that may alleviate symptoms of IBS-C like esophageal relaxation and the inhibition of human colonic circular muscle contraction can also occur [A11044]. Additionally, activating 5-HT(4) on enteric neurons and enterocytes also cause natural fluid secretion in the gut - an action which also strongly assists in promoting the movement of content along the gastrointestinal tract [A11044].



Alternatively, it has also been observed that 5-HT may participate in generating visceral hyperalgesia in IBS, an observation supported in part by the finding of increased amounts of 5-HT and its metabolites in the plasma of patients experiencing IBS [A176762] It has therefore also been proposed that antagonism of 5-HT(2B) receptors can lead to inhibition of both 5-HT mediated gastrointestinal motility and visceral hypersensitivity [A11044].



Subsequently, because tegaserod is considered to be an agonist of the 5-HT(4) receptor and an antagonist of the 5-HT(2B) receptor at clinically relevant levels, it is believed that tegaserod may elicit its mechanism of action by facilitating activities associated with the activation and antagonism of the 5-HT(4) and 5-HT(2B) receptors, like stimulating peristaltic gastrointestinal reflexes and intestinal secretion, inhibiting visceral sensitivity, enhancing basal motor activity, and normalizing impaired motility throughout the gastrointestinal tract, among other actions [A11044, A176762, F4223, F4226, F4229]. ', 'In general, it has been determined that tegaserod is an agonist of serotonin type-4 (5-HT(4)) receptors, an antagonist at 5-HT(2B) receptors, but is expected to possess minimal binding to 5-HT(1) receptors, and virtually no affinity for 5-HT(3) or dopamine receptors [A11044, A176762, F4223].



In clinical trials with tegaserod, centrally analyzed ECGs were recorded in 4,605 male and female patients receiving tegaserod 6 mg twice daily or placebo for IBS-C and other related motility disorders [F4223, F4229]. No subject receiving the agent had an absolute QTcF above 480 ms [F4223, F4229]. An increase in QTcF of 30 to 60 ms was observed in 7% of patients receiving tegaserod and 8% receiving placebo [F4223, F4229]. An increase in QTcF of greater than 60 ms was observed in 0.3% and 0.2% of subjects, respectively [F4223, F4229]. The effects of tegaserod on the QTcF interval were ultimately not considered to be clinically meaningful [F4223, F4229].



Furthermore, it was determined that there is a potential for tegaserod and its main metabolite (the M29 metabolite) to increase platelet aggregation in vitro [F4223, F4229]. In one in vitro study, at concentrations up to 10-times the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) at the recommended dose, tegaserod significantly increased platelet aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner up to 74% (range 11% to 74%) compared to a control vehicle (with potentiation by various agonists) [F4223, F4229]. In another in vitro study, the M29 metabolite, at concentrations up to 0.6-times the Cmax of M29 also showed a 5% to 16% increase in platelet aggregation compared to the control vehicle [F4223, F4229].

DNA gyrase is an enzyme found only in bacteria that introduces negative supercoils into DNA during replication - this helps to relieve torsional strain caused by the introduction of positive supercoils during replication, and these negative supercoils are essential for chromosome condensation and the promotion of transcription initiation.[A31453] It is comprised of four subunits (two A subunits and two B subunits) of which the A subunits appear to be the target of fluoroquinolone antibiotics.[A190663] Bacterial topoisomerase IV, in addition to contributing to the relaxation of positive supercoils, is essential at the terminal stages of DNA replication and functions to “unlink” newly replicated chromosomes to allow for the completion of cell division.[A31453]



Inhibition of these enzymes by levofloxacin likely occurs via complexation with the topoisomerase enzymes.[A31453] The end result is a blockade of DNA replication, thus inhibiting cell division and resulting in cell death.', 'Levofloxacin is bactericidal and exerts its antimicrobial effects via inhibition of bacterial DNA replication.[L11638] It has a relatively long duration of action in comparison with other antibiotics that allows for once or twice daily dosing.

These folic acid congeners are transported across cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis where they are needed to maintain normal erythropoiesis, synthesize purine and thymidylate nucleic acids, interconvert amino acids, methylate tRNA, and generate and use formate. Using vitamin B12 as a cofactor, folic acid can normalize high homocysteine levels by remethylation of homocysteine to methionine via methionine synthetase.', 'Folic acid is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin found in foods such as liver, kidney, yeast, and leafy, green vegetables. Also known as folate or Vitamin B9, folic acid is an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in DNA and RNA synthesis. More specifically, folic acid is required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. Folic acid is the precursor of tetrahydrofolic acid, which is involved as a cofactor for transformylation reactions in the biosynthesis of purines and thymidylates of nucleic acids. Impairment of thymidylate synthesis in patients with folic acid deficiency is thought to account for the defective deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis that leads to megaloblast formation and megaloblastic and macrocytic anemias. Folic acid is particularly important during phases of rapid cell division, such as infancy, pregnancy, and erythropoiesis, and plays a protective factor in the development of cancer. As humans are unable to synthesize folic acid endogenously, diet and supplementation is necessary to prevent deficiencies. In order to function properly within the body, folic acid must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted by anti-metabolite therapies such as [DB00563] as they function as DHFR inhibitors to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, and therefore prevent the formation of DHF and THF. 



In general, folate serum levels below 5 ng/mL indicate folate deficiency, and levels below 2 ng/mL usually result in megaloblastic anemia.', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

**A note on fungal infection prophylaxis**



Patients receiving bone marrow transplantation who are treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy may be predisposed to candida infections, and may receive fluconazole as prophylactic therapy.[L11043]



**A note on laboratory testing**



Obtaining specimens for fungal culture and other important laboratory studies such as serology or pathology is advised before starting fluconazole therapy in order to isolate the organisms to be eliminated through treatment. It is permissible to start therapy before the results are available, however, adjusting the therapy once laboratory results confirm the causative organism may be necessary.[L11043]

', 'Fluconazole is a very selective inhibitor of fungal cytochrome P450 dependent enzyme _lanosterol 14-α-demethylase_. This enzyme normally works to convert _lanosterol_ to _ergosterol_, which is necessary for fungal cell wall synthesis.  The free nitrogen atom located on the azole ring of fluconazole binds with a single iron atom located in the heme group of lanosterol 14-α-demethylase.[A178774] This prevents oxygen activation and, as a result, inhibits the demethylation of lanosterol, halting the process of ergosterol biosynthesis.[A178777]  Methylated sterols are then found to accumulate in the fungal cellular membrane, leading to an arrest of fungal growth.[A178774] These accumulated sterols negatively affect the structure and function of the fungal cell plasma membrane.[A16632]



Fluconazole resistance may arise from an alteration in the amount or function of the target enzyme (lanosterol 14-α-demethylase), altered access to this enzyme, or a combination of the above.[A16632] Other mechanisms may also be implicated, and studies are ongoing.[A178783]', 'Fluconazole has been demonstrated to show fungistatic activity against the majority of strains of the following microorganisms, curing fungal infections[L11043]:



_Candida albicans, Candida glabrata (Many strains are intermediately susceptible), Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, Cryptococcus neoformans_



This is achieved through steroidal inhibition in fungal cells, interfering with cell wall synthesis and growth as well as cell adhesion, thereby treating fungal infections and their symptoms.[L11043,A174325,A174343]



The fungistatic activity of fluconazole has also been shown in normal and immunocompromised animal models with both systemic and intracranial fungal infections caused by _Cryptococcus neoformans_ and for systemic infections caused by Candida albicans.[L11043]  It is important to note that resistant organisms have been found against various strains of organisms treated with fluconazole.[A178759,A178762,A178765] This further substantiates the need to perform susceptibility testing when fluconazole is considered as an antifungal therapy.[A178768,A178786] 





**A note on steroidal effects of fluconazole**



There has been some concern that fluconazole may interfere with and inactivate human steroids/hormones due to the inhibition of hepatic cytochrome enzymes.[L11034]  Fluconazole has demonstrated to be more selective for _fungal_ cytochrome P-450 enzymes than for a variety of mammalian cytochrome P-450 enzymes. Fluconazole 50 mg administered daily for up to 28 days in individuals of reproductive age has been show to have no effect on testosterone plasma concentrations of males and plasma concentrations of steroids in females. A 200-400 mg dose of fluconazole showed no clinically relevant effect on steroid levels or on ACTH-stimulated steroid response in healthy males, in one clinical study mentioned on the European Medicines Agency label.[L11034] Other studies have shown no significant effects of fluconazole on steroid levels, further confirming these data.[A174358,A178780]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

The drug further causes vacuolization and disintegration of the schistosome tegument. The effect is more marked on adult worms compared to young worms.

[L39095] Patients may experience ED due to a variety of causes including psychogenic, neurogenic, vasculogenic, iatrogenic, or endocrine. [A242392] These causes result in dysfunction of penile smooth muscle relaxation through either disrupted neuronal signaling or direct influence on smooth muscle cells. During sexual arousal, non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) neurons release nitric oxide (NO). Nitric oxide stimulates guanylate cyclase which converts guanosine triphosphate to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).[A242287, A242377] cGMP activates the cGMP-dependent kinase (PKG) in a signal cascade which activates K+ channels leading to inhibition of Ca2+ channels, inhibits platelet activation, and inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation while inducing apoptosis. This signal cascade is attenuated by PDE5 which breaks the phosphodiester bond of cGMP, converting it to GMP. Inhibition of PDE5 by tadalafil increases signaling via the PKG cascade which supports penile smooth muscle relaxation during sexual arousal by decreasing Ca2+ entry into smooth muscle cells. This smooth muscle relaxation allows blood to fill the corpus cavernosum thereby producing an erection.



In PAH, blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries is raised due to a variety of mechanisms stemming from endothelial dysfunction.[A242377] Decreased production of NO and prostacyclin reduce vasodilatory signaling while overproduction of endothelin-1 and thromboxane increase vasoconstriction. Inflammation, thromboses, and hypoxia later contribute to vascular remodeling which further reduces luminal size. The resultant increase in blood pressure reduces the capacity for gas exchange and increases afterload at the right ventricle, producing symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and dizziness as well as leading to right-sided heart failure. Tadalafil exerts its therapeutic effect in PAH through boosting NO-cGMP signaling to contribute to smooth muscle relaxation as with ED.



Lastly, tadalafil is used to treat BPH.[L39095] BPH produces urinary dysfunction through hyperproliferation of the epithelial and smooth muscle layers of the prostate.[A242382] The increased size of the prostate blocks urine flow through the urethra resulting in higher residual volumes due to incomplete emptying. Tadalafil does not appear to exert its benefit via smooth muscle relaxation of the prostate. It may instead exert its effect through a mix of increased oxygenation and decreased inflammation, which decreases tissue remodeling, and inhibition of cell proliferation through the cGMP cascade.



The decreased affinity for PDE6 compared to other PDE5 inhibitors may explain the decreased incidence of visual side effects as PDE6 is present in the eye and contributes to color vision.[L39100, L39105, A242287]', 'Tadalafil exerts a therapeutic effect in ED by increasing sexual stimulation-dependant smooth muscle relaxation in the penis, allowing the corpus cavernosum to fill with blood to produce an erection.[A242287, A242377] Smooth muscle relaxation in the pulmonary vasculature helps to produce vasodilation in PAH which reduces blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries.[A242377] In BPH, tadalafil may contribute to decreased smooth muscle cell proliferation which may reduce the size of the prostate and relieve the anatomical obstruction which produces urinary symptoms of BPH.[A242382] The decreased affinity of tadalafil for PDE6 compared to other PDE5 inhibitors may explain the reduced incidence of visual side effects.[L39100, L39105, A242287]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism and catabolism. In humans, insulin is stored in the form of hexamers; however, only insulin monomers are able to interact with IR. Reversal of the proline and lysine residues at positions B28 and B29 of native insulin eliminates hydrophobic interactions and weakens some of the hydrogen bonds that contribute to the stability of the insulin dimers that comprise insulin hexamers. Hexamers of insulin lispro are produced in the presence of zinc and <i>m</i>-cresol. These weakly associated hexamers quickly dissociate upon subcutaneous injection and are absorbed as monomers through vascular endothelial cells. These properties give insulin lispro its fast-acting properties. ', 'Insulin is a natural hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas. In non-diabetic individuals, a basal level of insulin is supplemented with insulin spikes following meals. Increased insulin secretion following meals is responsible for the metabolic changes that occur as the body transitions from a postabsorptive to absorptive state. Insulin promotes cellular uptake of glucose, particularly in muscle and adipose tissues, promotes energy storage via glycogenesis, opposes catabolism of energy stores, increases DNA replication and protein synthesis by stimulating amino acid uptake by liver, muscle and adipose tissue, and modifies the activity of numerous enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. Insulin also promotes growth and is required for the actions of growth hormone (e.g. protein synthesis, cell division, DNA synthesis). Insulin lispro is a rapid-acting insulin analogue used to mimic postprandial insulin spikes in diabetic individuals. The onset of action of insulin lispro is 10-15 minutes. Its activity peaks 60 minutes following subcutaneous injection and its duration of action is 4-5 hours. Compared to regular human insulin, insulin lispro  has a more rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of action. Insulin lispro is also shown to be equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis.  



Insulin lispro has been shown to be equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis. One unit of insulin lispro has the same glucose-lowering effect as one unit of regular human insulin. Studies in normal volunteers and patients with diabetes demonstrated that insulin lispro has a more rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of activity than regular human insulin when given subcutaneously.[L47616]



The pharmacodynamics of a single 20 unit dose of insulin lispro at 200 units/mL (HUMALOG U-200) administered subcutaneously were compared to the pharmacodynamics of a single 20 unit dose of insulin lispro at 100 units/mL (HUMALOG U-100) administered subcutaneously in a euglycemic clamp study enrolling healthy subjects. In this study, the overall, maximum, and time to maximum glucose lowering effect were similar between HUMALOG U-200 and HUMALOG U-100. The mean area under the glucose infusion rate curves (measure of overall pharmacodynamic effect) were 125 g and 126 g for HUMALOG U-200 and HUMALOG U-100, respectively. The maximum glucose infusion rate was 534 mg/min and 559 mg/min and the corresponding median time (min, max) to maximum effect were 2.8 h (0.5 h – 6.3 h) and 2.4 h (0.5 h – 4.7 h) for HUMALOG U-200 and HUMALOG U-100, respectively.[L47616] ', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

The classical interpretation of PTX''s broad effects is due to its ability to act, _in vitro_, as a non-specific cyclic-3'',5''-phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor at millimolar concentrations; specifically, it has been proposed that inhibition of PDE type III and IV isozymes leads to elevated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which mediate diverse downstream effects.[A226420, A226425, A226430] This view has been challenged, specifically by observing those plasma concentrations of PTX in routine clinical use are typically only around 1μM, far lower than those used to inhibit PDEs _in vitro_.[A226430] Instead, several studies have suggested that PTX can modulate adenosine receptor function, specifically the Gα-coupled A2A receptor (A2AR). Whether PTX acts directly as an A2AR agonist is unclear, although it can clearly increase the response of A2AR to adenosine.[A16840, A16821, A226350, A226435] A2AR activation activates adenylyl cyclase, which increases intracellular cAMP levels; this observation may explain PTX''s ability to increase intracellular cAMP in a PDE-independent fashion.[A226440]



Elevated cAMP levels have numerous downstream effects. cAMP-mediated activation of protein kinase A (PKA) suppresses nuclear translocation of NF-κB, which suppresses transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and IL-6 as well as TNF-induced molecules such as adhesion molecules (ICAM1 and VCAM1) and the C-reactive protein (CRP).[A226415, A226445, A226450, A226455] PTX has also been shown to prevent the downstream phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK, which are responsible for assembling the NADPH oxidase involved in the neutrophil oxidative burst. This effect is due to a PKA-independent decrease in Akt phosphorylation and a PKA-dependent decrease in phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK.[A226450, A226465, A226470] This transcriptional regulation at least partially explains the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties of PTX.



Also, activated PKA can activate the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which itself blocks SMAD-driven gene transcription, effectively disrupting transforming growth factor (TGF-β1) signalling.[A226440, A226475] This results in lower levels of fibrinogenic molecules such as collagens, fibronectin, connective tissue growth factor, and alpha-smooth muscle actin.[A226440, A226450, A226475, A226460] Hence, disruption of TGF-β1 signalling may explain the anti-fibrotic effects of PTX, including at least some of the decrease in blood viscosity.



The picture is complicated by the observation that PTX metabolites M1, M4, and M5 have been shown to inhibit C5 Des Arg- and formyl-methionylleucylphenylalanine-induced superoxide production in neutrophils and M1 and M5 significantly contribute to PTX''s observed hemorheological effects.[A226415, A226430, A226480] Overall, PTX administration is associated with decreased pro-inflammatory molecules, an increase in anti-inflammatory molecules such as IL-10, and decreased production of fibrinogenic and cellular adhesion molecules.', 'Pentoxifylline, a synthetic dimethylxanthine derivative structurally related to [theophylline] and [caffeine], exhibits hemorheological, anti-oxidative, and anti-inflammatory properties and is traditionally indicated in the treatment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD).

Concurrent use with [warfarin] should be associated with more frequent monitoring of prothrombin times. Also, patients with risk factors complicated by hemorrhages, such as retinal bleeding, peptic ulceration, and recent surgery, should be monitored periodically for bleeding signs.[L30300]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

The antidepressant, anti-anxiety, and other actions of citalopram are linked to its inhibition of CNS central uptake of serotonin.[L47941] Serotonergic abnormalities have been reported in patients with mood disorders. Behavioral and neuropsychological effects of serotonin include the regulation of mood, perception, reward, anger, aggression, appetite, memory, sexuality, and attention, as examples. The onset of action for depression is approximately 1 to 4 weeks. The complete response may take 8-12 weeks after initiation of citalopram.[L5224]

Potassium ions participate in a number of essential physiological processes including the maintenance of intracellular tonicity, the transmission of nerve impulses, the contraction of cardiac, skeletal and smooth muscle, and the maintenance of normal renal function. The intracellular concentration of potassium is approximately 150 to 160 mEq per liter. The normal adult plasma concentration is 3.5 to 5 mEq per liter.

Potassium is a normal dietary constituent and under steady-state conditions the amount of potassium absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract is equal to the amount excreted in the urine. The usual dietary intake of potassium is 50 to 100 mEq per day. Potassium depletion will occur whenever the rate of potassium loss through renal excretion and/or loss from the gastrointestinal tract exceeds the rate of potassium intake. Such depletion usually develops as a consequence of therapy with diuretics, primarily or secondary hyperaldosteronism, diabetic ketoacidosis, or inadequate replacement of potassium in patients on prolonged parenteral nutrition. Depletion can develop rapidly with severe diarrhea, especially if associated with vomiting. Potassium depletion due to these causes is usually accompanied by concomitant loss of chloride and is manifested by hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.

Intravenous indometacin is indicated to induce closure of a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants weighing between 500 and 1750 g when after 48 hours usual medical management (e.g., fluid restriction, diuretics, digitalis, respiratory support, etc.) is ineffective.[L10553]', 'Indometacin is a nonspecific and reversible inhibitor of the cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzyme or prostaglandin G/H synthase. There are two identified isoforms of COX: COX-1 is universally present in most body tissues and is involved in the synthesis of the prostaglandins and thromboxane A2, while COX-2 is expressed in response to injury or inflammation.[A177871] Constitutively expressed, the COX-1 enzyme is involved in gastric mucosal protection, platelet, and kidney function by catalyzing the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin (PG) G2 and PGG2 to PGH2.[A177871] COX-2 is constitutively expressed and highly inducible by inflammatory stimuli. It is found in the central nervous system, kidneys, uterus, and other organs. COX-2 also catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to PGG2 and PGG2 to PGH2. In the COX-2-mediated pathway, PGH2 is further converted to PGE2 and PGI2 (also known as prostacyclin). PGE2 is involved in mediating inflammation, pain, and fever. Decreasing levels of PGE2 leads to reduced inflammatory reactions. Indometacin is known to inhibit both isoforms of COX, however, with greater selectivity for COX-1, which accounts for its increased adverse gastric effects relative to other NSAIDs. It binds to the enzyme''s active site and prevents the interaction between the enzyme and its substrate, arachidonic acid. Indometacin, unlike other NSAIDs, also inhibits phospholipase A2, the enzyme responsible for releasing arachidonic acid from phospholipids. The analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects of indomethacin as well as adverse reactions associated with the drug occur as a result of decreased prostaglandin synthesis. Its antipyretic effects may be due to action on the hypothalamus, resulting in increased peripheral blood flow, vasodilation, and subsequent heat dissipation.



The exact mechanism of action of indometacin in inducing closure of a patent ductus arteriosus is not fully understood; however, it is thought to be through inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.[L6778] At birth, the ductus arteriosus is normally closed as the tension of the oxygen increases significantly after birth.[A177880] Patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants is associated with congenital heart malformations where PGE1 mediates an opposite effect to that of oxygen. PGE1 dilates the ductus arteriosus through smooth muscle relaxation and prevents the closure of the ductus arteriosus.[A177880] By inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins, indometacin promotes the closure of ductus arteriosus.[L10553]



Indometacin has been described as possessing anticancer and antiviral properties through activation of protein kinase R (PKR) and downstream phosphorylation of eIF2α, inhibiting protein synthesis.[A234429, A234434]', 'Indometacin is an NSAID with analgesic and antipyretic properties that exerts its pharmacological effects by inhibiting the synthesis of factors involved in pain, fever, and inflammation. Its therapeutic action does not involve pituitary-adrenal stimulation.[L6778] Indometacin primarily works by suppressing inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis by providing relief of pain as well as reducing fever, swelling, and tenderness. This effectiveness has been demonstrated by a reduction in the extent of joint swelling, the average number of joints displaying symptoms of inflammation, and the severity of morning stiffness. Increased mobility was demonstrated by a decrease in total walking time and by improved functional capability seen as an increase in grip strength.[L6778] In clinical trials, indometacin was shown to be effective in relieving the pain, reducing the fever, swelling, redness, and tenderness of acute gouty arthritis. Due to its pharmacological actions, the use of indometacin is associated with the risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, as well as gastrointestinal effects such as bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines.[L6778]



In a study of healthy individuals, acute oral and intravenous indometacin therapy resulted in a transiently diminished basal and CO2 stimulated cerebral blood flow; this effect disappeared in one study after one week of oral treatment.[L6778] The clinical significance of this effect has not been established. Compared to other NSAIDs, it is suggested that indometacin is a more potent vasoconstrictor that is more consistent in decreasing cerebral blood flow and inhibiting CO2 reactivity.[A177871] There have been studies that show indometacin directly inhibiting neuronal activity to some extent in the trigeminocervical complex after either superior salivatory nucleus or dural stimulation.[A177871]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

', '**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].



Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].



In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].



There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].



Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].



The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. 



In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].



In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].



The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].', 'Zinc is involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of human proteins may bind zinc, in addition to hundreds of proteins that transport and traffic zinc. It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is an essential element for a proper sense of taste and smell and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations [L2211].



Studies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions [L2095]:



**Colds:** Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently [L2095].



**Wound healing:** Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements [L2095]. 



**Diahrrea**: Oral zinc supplements can reduce the symptoms of diarrhea in children with low levels of zinc, especially in cases of malnutrition [L2095].

While milnacipran may be used for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), it is only recommended in adult patients who are 18 years old or above [F3922] due to an increased risk for suicidal ideation, thinking, and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults taking antidepressants for major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Some regional prescribing information notes that the use of the medication is specifically for the short-term symptomatic relief of MDD [F3919]. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the regulatory approval of and/or indications listed here for milnacipran may or may not exist and/or vary greatly between regions and nations [F3928, F3934].', 'The dual ability for milnacipran to inhibit the reuptake of both serotonin (5HT) and norepinephrine (NE) facilitates its treatment of both fibromyalgia and major depressive disorder (MDD).



In particular, it is generally believed that 5HT and NE participate in the modulation of endogenous analgesic mechanisms by way of the descending inhibitory pain pathways in the brain and spinal cord [A175759, A175843, A175846]. Although the specific mechanism of action remains unclear, some studies have proposed that low levels of 5HT may be associated with increased sensitivity to pain - a condition that could subsequently be improved by milnacipran''s capacity to enhance the presence of 5HT by inhibiting its reuptake via serotonin transporters at synaptic clefts [A175846, F3937, L5659]. Furthermore, in the CNS it is also generally believed that NE released from descending pathways can mitigate pain sensations via eliciting inhibitory effects on alpha-2A-adrenoceptors on central terminals of primary afferent nociceptors, by direct alpha-2-adrenergic action on pain-relay neurons, and by alpha-1-adrenoceptor-mediated activation of inhibitory interneurons [A175843]. Such NE pain mitigation is consequently also enhanced by milnacipran''s ability to enhance the presence of NE by inhibiting its reuptake via norepinephrine transporters at synaptic clefts [F3937].



Concurrently, milnacipran''s capacity to inhibit the reuptake of both 5HT and NE also facilitates its treatment of MDD. Given the monoamine hypothesis'' assertion that decreased 5HT can be associated with anxiety, obsessions, compulsions, and decreased NE can result in lowered alertness, energy, attention, and general interest in life, it is proposed that milnacipran''s basic activities as a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor could assist in treating such symptoms of MDD by increasing the presence of both 5HT and NE in the body by inhibiting their reuptake [A175840]. ', 'When utilized to treat fibromyalgia, the effect of milnacipran on the QTcF interval in patients was measured in a double-blind placebo-and positive-controlled parallel study in 88 healthy subjects using three to six times the recommended therapeutic dose for fibromyalgia at 600 mg/day [F3925]. After baseline and placebo adjustment, the maximum mean QTcF change was 8 ms - an increase that is generally not considered to be clinically significant [F3925].



Conversely, when used for treating major depressive disorder (MDD), non-clinical studies have shown that levomilnacipran binds with high affinity to the norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) transporters (Ki = 71-91 nM and 11 nM respectively at human transporters) [F3919, F3922, F3925]. Levomilnacipran inhibits the uptake of both NE and 5-HT in vitro and in vivo; preferentially inhibiting reuptake of NE over 5-HT by approximately 2-fold [F3919, F3922, F3925]. Levomilnacipran does not directly affect the uptake of dopamine or other neurotransmitters [F3919, F3922, F3925]. Levomilnacipran has no significant affinity for serotonergic (5-HT1-7), α- and β-adrenergic, muscarinic (M1-5), histamine (H1-4), dopamine (D1-5), opiate, benzodiazepine, and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in vitro [F3919, F3922]. Levomilnacipran has no significant affinity for Ca++, K+, Na+, and Cl– channels and does not inhibit the activity of human monoamine oxidases (MAO-A and MAO-B) or acetylcholinesterase [F3919, F3922, F3925].



Moreover, in ECG studies with levomilnacipran used to treat MDD, although no clinically significant changes in QTcF interval (QTcF=QT/RR0.33) were noted, it appears that the agent can cause increases in heart rate and blood pressure [F3919]. In particular, it appears that the maximum therapeutic dose of levomilnacipran at 120 mg/day is capable of causing a maximum mean difference in heart rate from placebo of 20.2 bpm and a mean difference in systolic and diastolic blood pressure from placebo ranging from 3.8 to 7.2 mmHg and 6.1 to 8.1 mmHg, respectively [F3919]. Alternatively, a supratherapeutic dose of 300 mg/day is capable of causing a maximum mean difference in heart rate from placebo of 22.1 bpm and a mean difference in systolic and diastolic blood pressure from placebo ranging from 5.4 to 7.9 mmHg and 7.9 to 10.6 mmHg, respectively [F3919].', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

PGE<sub>2</sub> is the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.[A179023] It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.[T116,A179023] PGE<sub>2</sub> activates the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled EP<sub>1</sub> receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE<sub>2</sub> also activates the EP<sub>4</sub> receptor, coupled to G<sub>s</sub>, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE<sub>2</sub> act via EP<sub>3</sub> to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP<sub>2</sub> to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI<sub>2</sub> is known to play a role via its G<sub>s</sub>-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.



PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP<sub>2</sub> receptors.[T116,A179044] Similarly to β adrenergic receptors these are G<sub>s</sub>-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE<sub>2</sub> also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.[T116] PGD<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP<sub>1</sub> receptor.[A179044] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.



PGE<sub>2</sub> can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory G<sub>q</sub> EP<sub>3</sub> receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.[T116] This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever. NSAIDs prevent the generation of PGE<sub>2</sub> thereby reducing the activity of these neurons.

The retention of phosphate plays a pivotal role in causing secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with osteodystrophy, and soft-tissue calcification. The mechanism by which phosphate retention leads to hyperparathyroidism is not clearly delineated. Therapeutic efforts directed toward the control of hyperphosphatemia include reduction in the dietary intake of phosphate, inhibition of absorption of phosphate in the intestine with phosphate binders, and removal of phosphate from the body by more efficient methods of dialysis. The rate of removal of phosphate by dietary manipulation or by dialysis is insufficient. Dialysis patients absorb 40% to 80% of dietary phosphorus. Therefore, the fraction of dietary phosphate absorbed from the diet needs to be reduced by using phosphate binders in most renal failure patients on maintenance dialysis. Calcium acetate when taken with meals combines with dietary phosphate to form insoluble calcium phosphate which is excreted in the feces. Maintenance of serum phosphorus below 6.0 mg/dl is generally considered as a clinically acceptable outcome of treatment with phosphate binders.

Under EMA approval, such fish oil pharmaceuticals comprised of virtually the same fish and fish oil derived omega-3-fatty acids EPA and DHA are indicated specifically for (a) adjuvant treatment in secondary prevention after myocardial infarction, in addition to other standard therapy (ie. statins, antiplatelet medicinal products, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors), and (b) as a supplement to diet when dietary measures alone are insufficient to produce an adequate response, particularly with type IV hypertriglyceridemia in monotherapy or type IIb/III in combination with statins, when control of triglycerides is insufficient [L2661]. In addition, prescribing information for EMA approved fish oil pharmaceuticals are also indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce very high (>=500 mg/dL) triglyceride levels in adult patients, much like similar FDA approved indications [F37, FDA Label].', 'The specific mechanism of action by which the fish oil EPA and DHA acids are capable of reducing serum triglyceride levels is not yet fully understood [FDA Label, A32933]. Nevertheless, it is proposed that such omega-3-fatty acids may not be the preferred substrates of the enzyme diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase that participates in the generation of triglycerides; that  they might interact with nuclear transcription factors that manage lipogenesis; or that their presence and increase in levels can cause cellular metabolism to subsequently shift toward a decrease in triglyceride synthesis and an increase in fatty acid oxidation [A32933]. Moreover, the EPA and DHA acids are also believed to be able to promote apolipoprotein B degradation in the liver through the stimulation of an autophagic process [A32933]. It may also be possible that these fish oil acids can accelerate the clearance of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles and chylomicron [A32933]. The combination of all these actions results in fewer VLDL particles being assembled and secreted, which is of considerable importance as VLDL particles are the major endogenous source of triglycerides [A32933].



Moreover, new paradigms of how inflammation is contained and dissipated involve various newly discovered chemical mediators, resolvins, and protectins [A32933]. Such agents are believed to be directly involved in blocking neutrophil migration, infiltration, recruitment, as well as blocking T-cell migration and promoting T-cell apoptosis [A32933]. Additionally, such protectins can also reduce tumor necrosis factor and interferon secretion [A32933]. Of particular importance, however, is the fact that protectins and resolvins are exclusively derived from omega-3-fatty acids and that EPA is the substrate of the resolvins family and DHA can be converted to both resolvins and protectins [A32933]. It is believed that these effects of such fish oil acids underlie the actions that fish oil have demonstrated on eliciting stability for vulnerable inflammatory plaques [A32933].



Finally, fish oil acids have demonstrated certain direct electrophysiological effects on the myocardium [A32933]. In animal studies, it was shown that the ventricular fibrillation threshold could be increased in both animals fed or infused with omega-3-fatty acids [A32933]. Further studies subsequently revealed that such fatty acids could reduce both sodium currents and L-type calcium currents on a cellular and ion channel level [A32933]. It is consequently hypothesized that during ischemia, a reduction in the sodium ion current protects hyperexcitable tissue, and a reduction in the calcium ion current could reduce arrhythmogenic depolarizing currents - and that perhaps the use of EPA and DHA fish oil acids could facilitate such activity [A32933]. For the time being, however, omega-3-fatty acids in pharmaceutical supplement form have not been shown to elicit such protection against heart conditions [L2662].', 'In general, the only practical method of obtaining and increasing the levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) fish oil omega-3-fatty acids in the body is to consume them directly from foods and/or dietary supplements [L784]. Having EPA and DHA is important because they facilitate numerous important functions in the human body. As an example, such supplementation of fish oil EPA and DHA demonstrates a legitimate ability to decrease triglyceride levels as their presence in the body can act as poor substrates for the enzymes that are ordinarily responsible for triglyceride synthesis and also inhibit the esterification of other fatty acids, among other mechanisms [FDA Label, L2661].



Moreover, such fish oil acids can become important components of the phospholipids that form the structures of cell membranes [L784]. Specifically, DHA is particularly high in the retina, brain, and sperm [L784]. Additionally, these acids also provide energy for the body and are used to form eicosanoids - signaling molecules that have similar chemical structures to the fish oil fatty acids from which they are derived [L784]. Furthermore, such eicosanoids possess wide-ranging functions in the cardiovascular, pulmonary, immune, and endocrine systems [L784].', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

', '**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].



Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].



In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].



There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].



Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].



The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. 



In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].



In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].



The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].', 'Zinc is involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism. It has been estimated that approximately 10% of human proteins may bind zinc, in addition to hundreds of proteins that transport and traffic zinc. It is required for the catalytic activity of more than 200 enzymes, and it plays a role in immune function wound healing, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Zinc is an essential element for a proper sense of taste and smell and supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence. It is thought to have antioxidant properties, which may be protective against accelerated aging and helps to speed up the healing process after an injury; however, studies differ as to its effectiveness. Zinc ions are effective antimicrobial agents even if administered in low concentrations [L2211].



Studies on oral zinc for specific conditions shows the following evidence in various conditions [L2095]:



**Colds:** Evidence suggests that if zinc lozenges or syrup are taken within 24 hours after cold symptoms start, the supplement may shorten the length of colds. The use intranasal zinc has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell, in some cases long-term or permanently [L2095].



**Wound healing:** Patients with skin ulcers and decreased levels of zinc may benefit from oral zinc supplements [L2095]. 



**Diahrrea**: Oral zinc supplements can reduce the symptoms of diarrhea in children with low levels of zinc, especially in cases of malnutrition [L2095].

This system affects body movement.  Negligible affinity is seen for ropinirole at α2 adrenoreceptors in the periphery and 5HT-1 receptor. Ropinirole has no affinity at the D1-like receptors, benzodiazepine or GABA receptors [A35711].

This drug promotes the relief or improvement of symptoms of Parkinson''s or restless leg syndrome by stimulatory actions on dopamine receptors, which regulate movement.



**Effects on blood pressure**



Clinical experience with dopamine agonists, including ropinirole, suggests an association with impaired abilities in regulating blood pressure with resulting orthostatic hypotension, especially with patients undergoing dose escalation. In some patients in clinical studies, blood pressure changes were associated with orthostatic symptoms, bradycardia, and, in one case in a healthy volunteer, transient sinus arrest accompanied by syncope [FDA label]. The mechanism of orthostatic hypotension caused by ropinirole is assumed to be due to a D2-mediated blunting of noradrenergic response to a standing position, followed by a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance. Nausea is also a frequent symptom which accompanies orthostatic signs and symptoms [FDA label].



**Effects on prolactin**



At oral doses as low as 0.2 mg, ropinirole suppressed serum prolactin concentrations in healthy male volunteers.

Ropinirole had no dose-related effect on ECG wave form and rhythm in young, healthy, male volunteers in the range of 0.01 to 2.5 mg [FDA label].



**Effects on QT interval**



Ropinirole had no dose- or exposure-related effect on average QT intervals in healthy male and female volunteers at doses up to 4 mg/day. The effect of ropinirole on QTc intervals at higher exposures reached either due to drug interactions, hepatic dysfunction, or at higher doses has not been adequately evaluated [FDA label].

Unique among the azoles, miconazole is thought to act through three main mechanisms.[A203636] The primary mechanism of action is through inhibition of the CYP450 14α-lanosterol demethylase enzyme, which results in altered ergosterol production and impaired cell membrane composition and permeability, which in turn leads to cation, phosphate, and low molecular weight protein leakage.[A203636, A203639]



In addition, miconazole inhibits fungal peroxidase and catalase while not affecting NADH oxidase activity, leading to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).[A203636, A203639, A203642] Increased intracellular ROS leads to downstream pleiotropic effects and eventual apoptosis.[A203636]



Lastly, likely as a result of lanosterol demethylation inhibition, miconazole causes a rise in intracellular levels of farnesol. This molecule participates in quorum sensing in _Candida_, preventing the transition from yeast to mycelial forms and thereby the formation of biofilms, which are more resistant to antibiotics.[A203645, A203648] In addition, farnesol is an inhibitor of drug efflux ABC transporters, namely _Candida_ CaCdr1p and CaCdr2p, which may additionally contribute to increased effectiveness of azole drugs.[A203648]', 'Miconazole is an azole antifungal that functions primarily through inhibition of a specific demethylase within the CYP450 complex.[A203636] As miconazole is typically applied topically and is minimally absorbed into the systemic circulation following application, the majority of patient reactions are limited to hypersensitivity and cases of anaphylaxis.[L14021] Patients using intravaginal miconazole products are advised not to rely on contraceptives to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, as well as not to use tampons concurrently.[L14027]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

This drug is indicated in amenorrhea and abnormal uterine bleeding due to hormonal imbalance in the absence of organic pathology, such as submucous fibroids or uterine cancer [F3907]. 



**Tablets, contraceptive**



The tablet form of progesterone in contraceptive formulations is indicated for the prevention of pregnancy [F3904]. ', 'Progesterone binds and activates its nuclear receptor, _PR_, which plays an important part in the signaling of stimuli that maintain the endometrium during its preparation for pregnancy.



Progesterone receptor (PR) is a member of the nuclear/steroid hormone receptor (SHR) family of ligand-dependent transcription factors that is expressed primarily in female reproductive tissue as well as the central nervous system. As a result of its binding its associated steroid hormone, progesterone, the progesterone receptor (PR) modulates the expression of genes that regulate the development, differentiation, and proliferation of target tissues [A175666]. In humans, PR is found to be highly expressed in the stromal (connective tissue) cells during the secretory phase and during pregnancy [A175651]. 



Progesterone may prevent pregnancy by changing the consistency of cervical mucus to be unfavorable for sperm penetration, and by inhibiting follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which normally causes ovulation.  With perfect use, the first-year failure rate for progestin-only oral contraceptives is approximately 0.5%. The typical failure rate, however, is estimated to be approximately 5%, due to late or missed pills [F3904].', 'Progesterone, depending on concentration and dosage form, and timing of exposure may have several pharmacodynamic effects.  These actions, according, to various preparations, are listed below:



General effects



Progesterone is the main hormone of the corpus luteum and the placenta. It acts on the uterus by changing the proliferative phase to the secretory phase of the endometrium (inner mucous lining of the uterus).   This hormone, stimulated by a hormone called _luteinizing hormone_ (LH) is the main hormone during the secretory phase to prepare the corpus luteum and the endometrium for implantation of a fertilized ovum. As the luteal phase concludes, the progesterone hormone sends negative feedback to the anterior pituitary gland in the brain to decrease FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and LH (luteinizing hormone) levels. This prevents ovulation and maturation of oocytes (immature egg cells). The endometrium then prepares for pregnancy by increasing its vascularity (blood vessels) and stimulating mucous secretion. This process occurs by progesterone stimulating the endometrium to decrease endometrial proliferation, leading to a decreased uterine lining thickness, developing more complex uterine glands, collecting energy in the form of glycogen, and providing more uterine blood vessel surface area suitable for supporting a growing embryo. As opposed to cervical mucous changes observed during the proliferative phase and ovulation, progesterone decreases and thickens the cervical mucus, rendering it less elastic. This change occurs because the fertilization time period has passed, and a specific consistency of mucous amenable to sperm entry is no longer required [T490].



**Gelatinized capsules**



Progesterone capsules are an oral dosage form of micronized progesterone which, chemically identical to progesterone of ovarian origin. Progesterone capsules have all the properties of endogenous progesterone with induction of a secretory phase endometrium with gestagenic, antiestrogenic, slightly antiandrogenic and anti-aldosterone effects [F3913]. Progesterone opposes the effects of estrogen on the uterus, and is beneficial in women with unopposed estrogen exposure, which carries an increased risk of malignancy [F3913].





**Vaginal gel and vaginal insert**



 The gel preparation mimics the effects of naturally occurring progesterone. In the presence of adequate levels of estrogen, progesterone converts a proliferative endometrium into secretory endometrium. This means that the endometrium changes from a growing and thickening stage into a subsequent preparation stage for pregnancy, which involves further preparatory changes. Progesterone is necessary for the development of decidual tissue (specialized tissue amenable to supporting a possible pregnancy). Progesterone is required to increase endometrial receptivity for the implantation of a fertilized embryo. Once an embryo is implanted, progesterone helps to maintain the pregnancy [F3898]. 





**Injection (intramuscular)**



 Intramuscularly injected progesterone increases serum progesterone and aids in the prevention of endometrial tissue overgrowth due to unopposed estrogen (which leads to abnormal uterine bleeding and sometimes uterine cancer) [L5638], [F3916]. In the absence or deficiency of progesterone, the endometrium continually proliferates, eventually outgrowing its limited blood supply, shedding incompletely, and leading to abnormal and/or profuse bleeding as well as malignancy [L5638].



**Tablets, contraceptive**



Progesterone-only contraceptive tablets prevent conception by suppressing ovulation in about half of users, causing a thickening of cervical mucus to inhibit sperm movement, lowering the midcycle LH and FSH hormone peaks, slowing the movement of the ovum through the fallopian tubes, and causing secretory changes in the endometrium as described above [F3904].', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Insulin binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units. The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor is able to autophosphorylate and phosphorylate numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1.

These active metabolites are nucleosides that mediate antitumour effects. dFdCTP competes with deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) for incorporation into DNA, thereby competitively inhibiting DNA chain elongation. The non-terminal position of dFdCTP in the DNA chain prevents detection of dFdCTP in the chain and repair by proof-reading 3′5′-exonuclease: this process is referred to as "masked DNA chain termination."

[L1127]



In postmenopausal women, strontium ranelate can also reduce the risk of vertebral and hip fractures [L1127].', 'The underlying pathogenesis of osteperosis involves an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation. Osteoclasts are a kind of differentiated or specialized bone cell that breaks down bone tissue while osteoblasts are another set of differentiated bone cells that synthesize and rebuild bone tissue. When osteoclasts degrade bone tissue faster than the osteoblasts are capable of rebuilding the bone tissue, low or inadequate bone mass density and osteoperosis can resula One of the mechanisms with which strontium ranelate is thought to act is its functionality as an agonist of the extracellular calcium sensing receptors (CaSRs) [A31553] of osteoblasts and osteoclasts [A31542]. Ordinary interaction between calcium 2+ divalent cations with mature osteoclast CaSRs is known to induce osteoclast apoptosis. Subsequently, strontium 2+ divalent cations from strontium ranelate use can also bind CaSRs on osteoclasts to induce their apoptosis because of the strontium 2+ cation''s close resemeblance to calcium 2+. Contact between extracelluar calcium 2+ and osteoclast CaSRs stimulates the phospholipase C (PLC) dependant breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) into the two secondary messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). Whereas the calcium-CaSRs interaction then performs IP3 Adependent translocation of nuclear factor NF-kB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in mature osteoclasts, strontium-CaSRs interactions involves a DAG-PKC beta II (protein kinase C beta II) signalling pathway for translocating NF-kB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in an IP3-independent manner. Although the calcium 2+ and strontium 2+ mediated signalling pathways are different, both CaSR interactions induce osteoclast apoptosis and are in fact capable of potentiating each other, leading to enhanced osteoclast apoptosis and decreased bone tissue degradation [A31565].



At the same time, given the similarity between the calcium 2+ and strontium 2+ cations, strontium 2+ cations from strontium ranelate are seemingly also able to act as an agonist and stimulate the CaSRs on osteoblasts, possibly in tandem with various local osteoblast stimulatory growth factors like transforming growth factor β (TGF β) and/or bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), to stimulate cyclic D genes and early oncogenes like c-fos and egr-1 that can mediate the mitogenesis and proliferation of new or more osteoblasts [A31580]. Moreover, although the involvement of the PLC mediated pathway may be a part of the signalling mechanism in osteoblasts following the stimulation of their CaSRs, this has not yet been fully elucidated [A31580].



Furthermore, strontium ranelate is also thought to be capable of stimulating osteoblasts to enhance the expression of osteoprotegerin while also concurrently reducing the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-Β ligand (RANKL) in primary human osteoblastic cells. As osteoprotegerin can competitively bind to RANKL as a decoy receptor, which can prevent RANKL from binding to RANK, which is an activity that facilitates the signaling pathway for the differentiation and activaiton of osteoclasts. The subsequent net effect of these actions ultiamtely results in decreased osteoclastogenesis. [A31553]



Moreover, bone biopsies obtained from patients treated with stronatium ranelate in clinical study reveal improvements in intrinsic bone tissue quality and microarchitecutre in ostepoerosis as evidenced by increased trabecular number, decreased trabecular separation, lower structure model index, and increased cortical thickness associated with a shift in trabecular structure from rod to plate like configurations compared with control patients [A31553].



Additionally, strontium from administered strontium ranelate is absorbed onto the crystal surface of treated bones and only slightly substitiutes for calcium in the apatite crystal of newly formed bone. As a result, there is an increased X-ray absorption of strontium as compared to calcium, which can lead to an amplification of bone mineral density (BMD) measurement by dual-proton X-ray absorptiometry. In essence, although strontium ranelate use can increase BMD some of the observations may be overestimations due to skeletal accretion of strontium in strontium ranelate treated patients [A31553].



Having the ability to both generate more osetoblasts and decrease the number of osteoclasts gives strontium ranelate an apparent dual mechanism of action when used to treat osteoperosis.', 'In general, it is believed that strontium ranelate is capable of affecting a rebalance in bone turnover in favour of bone formation by: (1) increasing osteoblast differentiation from progenitors, osteoblast activity and survival, as well as regulating osteoblast-induced osteoclastogenesis, and (2) decreasing osteoclast differentiation and activity, as well as increasing osteoclast apoptosis [A31541]. 



It has also been shown that strontium ranelate is capable of improving and strengthening various components of overall bone tissue quality like bone mineral density and bone microarchitecture [A31541, A31542, A31553].   ', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Indicated for the long-term treatment of the above conditions.[F3202]', 'Hydrochloric acid (HCl) secretion into the gastric lumen is a process regulated mainly by the H(+)/K(+)-ATPase of the proton pump, expressed in high quantities by the parietal cells of the stomach.[A174295] ATPase is an enzyme on the parietal cell membrane that facilitates hydrogen and potassium exchange through the cell, which normally results in the extrusion of potassium and formation of HCl (gastric acid). 



Proton pump inhibitors such as pantoprazole are substituted _benzimidazole_ derivatives, weak bases, which accumulate in the acidic space of the parietal cell before being converted in the _canaliculi_  (small canal) of the gastric parietal cell, an acidic environment, to active _sulfenamide_ derivatives. This active form then makes disulfide bonds with important cysteines on the gastric acid pump, inhibiting its function.[A174247] Specifically, pantoprazole binds to the _sulfhydryl group_ of H+, K+-ATPase, which is an enzyme implicated in accelerating the final step in the acid secretion pathway. The enzyme is inactivated, inhibiting gastric acid secretion.[A174253] The inhibition of gastric acid secretion is stronger with proton pump inhibitors such as pantoprazole and lasts longer than with the H(2) antagonists.[A174295] ', 'This drug acts to decrease gastric acid secretion, which reduces stomach acidity. Pantoprazole administration leads to long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion.[F3193]



**General Effects**



Pantoprazole has been shown to reduce acid reflux-related symptoms, heal inflammation of the esophagus, and improve patient quality of life more effectively than histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2 blockers). This drug has an excellent safety profile and a low incidence of drug interactions. It can be used safely in various high-risk patient populations, including the elderly and those with renal failure or moderate hepatic dysfunction.[A174226]



Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as pantoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]



PPIs such as pantoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes [A177577, A177580]. 



**A note on laboratory testing abnormalities**



During treatment with antisecretory medicinal products such as pantoprazole, serum gastrin (a peptide hormone that stimulates secretion of gastric acid) increases in response to the decreased acid secretion caused by proton pump inhibition. The increased gastrin level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Published evidence suggests that proton pump inhibitors should be stopped 14 days before chromogranin A (CgA) measurements. This permits chromogranin A levels, that might be falsely elevated after proton pump inhibitor treatment, to return to the normal reference range.[F3217] 



Reports have been made of false-positive results in urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving the majority of proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole. A confirmatory method should be used.[F3217]', 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);

Animal studies have shown that _ginkgo biloba_ works on several neurotransmitter pathways and brain structures. Flavones were shown to inhibit lipid peroxidation; inhibit the uptake of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine; and inhibit platelet aggregation.[A232404] Terpene lactones may also act as potent antagonists of the platelet-activating factor and may possess anti-ischemic and fibrinolytic effects.[A232379] They were also shown to downregulate adrenal peripheral benzodiazepine receptors and increase adrenocorticotropic hormone levels.[A232404] _Ginkgo biloba_ also reversibly inhibits monoamine oxidase A; and modestly inhibits anticholinesterase activity,[A232379, A232389] leading to enhanced cholinergic transmission in the brain.[A232394]

Some clinical studies of dementia that were up to one year long showed that EGb improves the cognitive performance and social functioning of patients. However, other studies did not support its clinical benefit for patients with cognitive impairment and dementia. Numerous meta-analysis studies showed insufficient evidence of the effectiveness of EGb in reducing both all-cause dementia incidence and Alzheimer''s disease-associated dementia incidence in elderly patients with normal cognition or with mild cognitive impairment. Additionally, there is no up-to-date evidence that demonstrates the benefit of the long-term use of standardized EGb in reducing the risk of progression to Alzheimer''s disease. A 2012 meta-analysis did not support the use of EGb in enhancing cognitive function in healthy adults.[A232379]



In the context of cardiovascular diseases, a limited number of studies showed that EGb improved mortality or neurological recovery in the post-stroke period, reduced cognitive and neurological impairment after acute ischemic stroke, and improved blood flow in the coronary artery in patients with coronary artery disease. However, a systemic review found no statistical or clinically significant benefit of EGb for patients with peripheral arterial disease or hypertension. Overall, there is a lack of strong evidence in the use of EGb for the treatment or prevention of cardiovascular diseases.[A232379]

PGE<sub>2</sub> is the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.[A179023] It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.[T116,A179023] PGE<sub>2</sub> activates the G<sub>q</sub>-coupled EP<sub>1</sub> receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE<sub>2</sub> also activates the EP<sub>4</sub> receptor, coupled to G<sub>s</sub>, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE<sub>2</sub> act via EP<sub>3</sub> to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP<sub>2</sub> to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP<sub>2</sub> receptor which couples to G<sub>s</sub>. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI<sub>2</sub> is known to play a role via its G<sub>s</sub>-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.



PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP<sub>2</sub> receptors.[T116,A179044] Similarly to β adrenergic receptors these are G<sub>s</sub>-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE<sub>2</sub> also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.[T116] PGD<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP<sub>1</sub> receptor.[A179044] PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP<sub>2</sub>, and EP<sub>4</sub> receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.



PGE<sub>2</sub> can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory G<sub>q</sub> EP<sub>3</sub> receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.[T116] This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever.

Penile erection during sexual stimulation is caused by increased penile blood flow resulting from the relaxation of penile arteries and corpus cavernosal smooth muscle. This response is mediated by the release of nitric oxide (NO) from nerve terminals and endothelial cells, which stimulates the synthesis of cyclic GMP in smooth muscle cells. Cyclic GMP causes smooth muscle relaxation and increased blood flow into the corpus cavernosum. The tissue concentration of cyclic GMP is regulated by both the rates of synthesis and degradation via phosphodiesterases (PDEs), and the most abundant PDE in the human corpus cavernosum is PDE5. Therefore, the inhibition of PDE5 by vardenafil enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cyclic GMP.[L45563]', 'Vardenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), an enzyme responsible for the degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum.

Therefore, in patients with erectile dysfunction given vardenafil, normal sexual stimulation will increase cGMP levels in the corpus cavernosum. Without sexual stimulation and no cGMP production, vardenafil should not cause an erection.[L45563,L45568]

This binding results in displacement of divalent cations and increased membrane permeability, allowing for aminoglycoside entry.[A232294, A232304, A232309, A232314]

The second “energy-dependent phase I” of aminoglycoside entry into the cytoplasm relies on the proton-motive force and allows a limited amount of aminoglycoside access to its primary intracellular target - the bacterial 30S ribosome.[A232294, A232314] This ultimately results in the mistranslation of proteins and disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane.[A233320] Finally, in the “energy-dependent phase II” stage, concentration-dependent bacterial killing is observed. Aminoglycoside rapidly accumulates in the cell due to the damaged cytoplasmic membrane, and protein mistranslation and synthesis inhibition is amplified.[A232294, A232314, A232319] The necessity of oxygen-dependent active transport explains why aminoglycosides are ineffective against anaerobic bacteria.[A234130]

Hence, aminoglycosides have both immediate bactericidal effects through membrane disruption and delayed bactericidal effects through impaired protein synthesis; observed experimental data and mathematical modeling support this two-mechanism model.[A232294, A232299]

Inhibition of protein synthesis is a key component of aminoglycoside efficacy. Structural and cell biological studies suggest that aminoglycosides bind to the 16S rRNA in helix 44 (h44), near the A site of the 30S ribosomal subunit, altering interactions between h44 and h45. This binding also displaces two important residues, A1492 and A1493, from h44, mimicking normal conformational changes that occur with successful codon-anticodon pairing in the A site.[A232324, A232329] Overall, aminoglycoside binding has several negative effects including inhibition of translation, initiation, elongation, and ribosome recycling.[A232294, A232334, A232339] Recent evidence suggests that the latter effect is due to a cryptic second binding site situated in h69 of the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit.[A232329, A232339] Also, by stabilizing a conformation that mimics correct codon-anticodon pairing, aminoglycosides promote error-prone translation.[A232344] Mistranslated proteins can incorporate into the cell membrane, inducing the damage discussed above.[A232294, A232319]', NULL, 'DrugBank', 0, 0, 0);
