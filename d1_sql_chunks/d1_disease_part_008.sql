Ziprasidone can prolong the QT interval of the electrocardiogram in a dose-related manner.  The risk of torsade de pointes is progressively increased as the degree of prolongation becomes greater.  In clinical trials, ziprasidone increased the QTc interval by approximately 10 msec at the highest recommended daily dosage of 160 mg compared to placebo.  The manufacturer states that ziprasidone should be discontinued in patients with persistent QTc measurements greater than 500 msec.
Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia may augment the prolongation effect of ziprasidone on the QT interval and should be corrected prior to institution of ziprasidone therapy.  In addition, patients who experience frequent, severe, or prolonged diarrhea may be subject to electrolyte losses and should be followed closely and managed accordingly during therapy with ziprasidone.', '3', 'DDInter', 0);
