Treatment with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists has been associated with dose-dependent prolongation of the QT interval. Theoretically, coadministration with other agents that can prolong the QT interval including some SSRIs may result in additive effects and increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes and sudden death.', NULL, 'Caution is advised if 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are prescribed in combination with SSRIs.', NULL, 'Caution is advised if 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are prescribed in combination with SSRIs. Patients should be closely monitored for symptoms of the serotonin syndrome during treatment. Particular caution is warranted when initiating or increasing the dosages of these agents. The potential risk for serotonin syndrome should be considered even when administering serotonergic agents sequentially, as some agents may demonstrate a prolonged elimination half-life. For example, a 5-week washout period is typically recommended following use of fluoxetine before administering another serotonergic agent. If serotonin syndrome develops or is suspected during the course of therapy, all serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately and supportive care rendered as necessary. Moderately ill patients may also benefit from the administration of a serotonin antagonist (e.g., cyproheptadine, chlorpromazine). Severe cases should be managed under consultation with a toxicologist and may require sedation, neuromuscular paralysis, intubation, and mechanical ventilation in addition to the other measures.', 'Synergism', 'Viloxazine, Esketamine', NULL, 'Major', NULL, 'DDInter', 'pharmacodynamic', NULL, 'https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/150841/', '[1] Cerner Multum, Inc.

The proposed mechanism is SSRI inhibition (competitive and/or noncompetitive) of CYP450 2D6, the isoenzyme responsible for the metabolic clearance of beta-blockers such as carvedilol, labetalol, metoprolol, nebivolol, propranolol, and timolol. Paroxetine and norfluoxetine (the active metabolite of fluoxetine), in particular, are potent inhibitors of CYP450 2D6 and may be more likely than other SSRIs to cause the interaction. On the other hand, fluvoxamine is a potent inhibitor of CYP450 1A2 and may significantly interact with propranolol, which is a substrate of both CYP450 2D6 and 1A2.', NULL, 'During concomitant therapy with SSRIs, a lower initial dosage and more cautious titration of the beta-blocker may be appropriate.', NULL, 'During concomitant therapy with SSRIs, a lower initial dosage and more cautious titration of the beta-blocker may be appropriate. Cardiac function should be closely monitored and the beta-blocker dosage adjusted accordingly, particularly following initiation, discontinuation or change of dosage of SSRI in patients who are stabilized on their beta-blocker regimen. Due to the long half-life of fluoxetine and its active metabolite, norfluoxetine, the risk of an interaction may exist for an extended period (up to several weeks) after discontinuation of fluoxetine. To avoid the interaction, use of beta-blockers that are primarily eliminated by the kidney such as atenolol, acebutolol, betaxolol, carteolol, and nadolol may be considered.', 'Metabolism', 'Ivabradine, Esmolol, Betaxolol, Carteolol, Penbutolol', 'St. John''s Wort, Oxitriptan, Tryptophan, Vortioxetine, Milnacipran, Levomilnacipran, Vilazodone, Esketamine, Escitalopram', 'Moderate', NULL, 'DDInter', 'pharmacodynamic', NULL, 'https://ddinter2.scbdd.com/server/interact/150912/', '[1] Walley T, Pirmohamed M, Proudlove C, Maxwell D "Interaction of metoprolol and fluoxetine."
