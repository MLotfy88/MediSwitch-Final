Cyclosporine causes a reversible reduction in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate resulting in increased serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen.  Mild nephrotoxicity generally responds to reductions in cyclosporine doses.  Persistent, chronic, and progressive nephrotoxicity has occurred.  Renal biopsies from these patients can demonstrate interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, global or segmental glomerulosclerosis, or smooth vascular muscle damage.  Larger cumulative doses or elevated cyclosporine trough levels may be associated with the development of interstitial fibrosis.  Clinical monitoring of renal function is necessary and differentiation between cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity, allograft rejection, and other causes of impaired renal function should be determined prior to cyclosporine dosage adjustments.', '3', 'Harris KP, Jenkins D, Walls J "Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and cyclosporine: a potentially serious adverse interaction."

CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea after antibacterial use.  Since CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after antibacterial use, careful medical history is necessary.  Therapy with broad-spectrum antibacterials and other agents with significant antibacterial activity should be administered cautiously in patients with history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis; pseudomembranous colitis (generally characterized by severe, persistent diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps, and sometimes associated with the passage of blood and mucus), if it occurs, may be more severe in these patients and may be associated with flares in underlying disease activity.

Therapy with tetracyclines should be administered cautiously in patients with preexisting liver disease or biliary obstruction.  Reduced dosages may be appropriate, particularly with minocycline and doxycycline, since the former is metabolized by the liver and the latter undergoes enterohepatic recycling.  Liver function tests are recommended prior to and during therapy, and the concomitant use of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs should be avoided.', '2', 'Burette A, Finet C, Prigogine T, De Roy G, Deltenre M "Acute hepatic injury associated with minocycline."
