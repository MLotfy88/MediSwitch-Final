This may enable focused use of blood products during resuscitation.\nQuantifies the interaction of platelets with the coagulation cascade (aggregation, clot strengthening, fibrin cross linking and fibrinolysis).\n0.36mL of clotted blood from the patient is spun in a small cup with changes in the clot strength recorded electrically.\nTwo commercial types of viscoelastic tests are available:\nThromboelastography =TEG\nRotational thromboelastogram = ROTEM\nHeparinase to deactivate heparin is now employed in the TEG(r) technology to prevent interference from heparin in samples\n[2]",
